Should both Liverpool and Leicester, who host Tottenham Hotspur, win their final fixture of the season, Leicester will overtake Liverpool if their margin of victory is greater than Liverpool's by four or more goals.\n- All discussion of goal difference, however, is moot should Chelsea drop points on their final day visit to Aston Villa. A draw in Birmingham would see both Liverpool and Leicester City qualify for Europe's most prestigious competition with a win, while an Aston Villa win would make even a draw enough for Liverpool, but not for Leicester, unless Aston Villa win by three goals or more.\n- Before this Winter's horrid run of six successive home defeats, Crystal Palace were the last visiting team to win a Premier League game at Anfield, courtesy of a Christian Benteke brace in April 2017.\n- Since then, however, it has been seven consecutive defeats for Sunday's visitors by an aggregate scoreline of 22-5 to the Reds.\n- Liverpool won this season's reverse fixture by seven goals to nil with goals from Takumi Minamino, Sadio Mane, Jordan Henderson and a brace each from Roberto Firmino and substitute Mohamed Salah. In the process, Liverpool became the first Premier League side to concede 7 in a game and score 7 in a game within the same season.\n- In their latest game, Palace closed out their home season with a 1-3 defeat to Arsenal after conceding two stoppage time goals, while Liverpool dispatched Burnley by a scoreline of 3-0.\n\n\n##**We've conquered all of Europe**",

        "self_text":"Watching [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j30nEIZU0WA&amp;ab_channel=TheOverlap) interview between Kane and Neville from the overlap, we can see many things. TLDR at the end.\n\nFirst off, be real you all. We all know the sky sports rumor mill has sold Kane year after year around this time. They even said he has requested again to leave our club. Ok, when was the first time? Last year when they made up the same garbage? (I am aware of the supposed gentleman's agreement between him and Levy)\n\nEveryone who watches that video above I linked will see or has seen that even trustworthy outlets like Fabrizio (for the most part) are taking bits and pieces spinning it to make it look like Kane is leaving, to get clicks. \n\nIn the interview Kane said \"I'd never say that I'd stay at Spurs for the rest of my career. I'd never say that I would leave Spurs.\". That should be more than enough to invalidate all the garbage currently out there.\n\nGoing on to my idea which I think is reasonable. Harry will go to Levy and they will have their honest talk. I see it going one of two ways; in short, he tells Levy either you get serious about backing this club with top players and silverware or I'm out. If Levy presents him a future of ambitious signings, a strong manager, and contention for trophies, and then actually delivers on it, I truly think Kane will stay. I don' think Kane wants more money or anything of the sort, he just desires to win.\n\nIf Kane decides to leave, whether it be Levy can't give him what he wants, or he just decides on his own that he wants to leave I can't blame him. He's done us an absolute service, and as much as I'd love to see him go down star studded as our all time top scorer, he deserves to win. If Levy doesn't show him right now that he's going to back the squad, manager, and players to win, then I think Kane will leave. \n\nTLDR; Stop believing rumors. Levy shows Kane he is serious about winning == Kane stays. Otherwise, Kane goes.\n\nI welcome all responses, I am curious to hear what others have to say! Let's have a discussion.\n\nWe will get through this no matter what happens. Our club existed before Kane, and worst case, will exist after Kane. We made it through the UCL Knockouts against some tenacious opponents without Kane, with an arguably broken squad that needed a rebuild, and a bit of luck. #COYS\n\nPS: When ENIC acquired ownership and delegated management to Levy in 2001 we were a mid table club at best that was worth around $85 million. We are one of the only self sustaining clubs (meaning we do not have investors dumping money in, as that is not sustainable. We only spend and run the club using what we make from our profits) and we have grown by about 10% annually like clockwork. According to forbes, we are worth around $2.3 billion as of April 2021. I want to see a trophy just as much as the rest of you, but there's no denying Levy has grown us to great heights as a football club.",

        "self_text":"I\u2019m seeing a lot of comments about Kane going missing in the bigger games lately and I wanted to see if that is statistically true, at least in terms of goals (he is a striker, after all)\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided to take all 53 games against big 6 opposition since summer 2016, and analyze them\n\nDisclaimer 1: Leicester only became \u201cbig 6\u201d in 2019\n\nDisclaimer 2: This is pure stats in terms of goals, this does not include assists or anything like that, so it may not give the full picture of his performances. The idea is that, as a top 5 striker in the world, has he scored enough in these big games? Let\u2019s see\n\nDisclaimer 3: Debatable that Arsenal have dropped out of the \u201cbig 6\u201d since 2018, but the NLD is always a huge game so it counts\n\n\nIn 16-17 (great season, we finished 2nd)\n-Two goals against Arsenal (both penalties)\n-No goals in 5 games against Chelsea, Liverpool or City\n-Scored the final Tottenham goal at WHL against United\n\nFinal tally: 3 (2 penalties)\n\nIn 17-18 (very good season, 3rd place, pushing MU for 2nd)\n-Scored to win the home NLD\n-Scored a stoppage time penalty at Liverpool (missed one in the same game)\nNo goals in 5 games against Chelsea, City or United (second season in a row he fired blanks against the oil clubs)\n\nFinal tally: 2 (1 penalty)\n\nIn 18-19 (last good season, 4th, CL final)\n-Penalty at Arsenal to secure a point\n-Scored against Chelsea\n-Scored at United\n-No goals in 3 games against either Liverpool or City\n\nFinal tally: 3 (1 penalty)\n\n\nIn 19-20 (pretty terrible season, Poch was sacked, 6th)\n-Scored a penalty v Arsenal\n-Scored 3 across 2 games against Leicester (actually a good side here)\n-Scored at Anfield\n-Scored none in 4 appearances against Chelsea, City and United\n\nFinal tally: 5 (1 penalty)\n\nIn 20-21 (this awful season)\n-Scored vs Arsenal\n-Scored two at United (one penalty)\n-None in 6 games against Chelsea, City, Liverpool and Leicester\n*Game against Leicester still to play\n\nTally after 11 games: 3 (1 penalty)\n\n\nSo in terms of goals in big games, Kane\u2019s tally is 3, 2, 3, 5, 3, which amounts to a total of 16 goals in 46 games, 6 of them penalties\n\nHonestly shocked at this return when I ended up doing further research, especially 16-17, which is when we were at our peak. 10 open play goals from 46 games is not impressive in the slightest though\n\nIn terms of distribution, 6 of these 16 goals came against Arsenal, 3 came against Leicester, 4 against Man United, 2 against Liverpool, 1 against Chelsea, and none against City\n\nI might do a follow-up on this which includes assists, to get a better picture, but in terms of outright goals he\u2019s only managed to score in about a third of the big games he\u2019s actually played\n\nHere\u2019s the real kicker: Kane has scored 116 goals in the past 5 seasons. Only 16 came against big 6 opposition\n\nLet me know if you were as surprised by this as I was. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gone missing in the big games, and this isn\u2019t a \u201cKane wasn\u2019t all that good anyway\u201d post, because that is pure bollocks.

        "self_text":"The recent Kane saga has brought a lot comparisons to how other big names have left Tottenham in the past. I thought it would be interesting to have a look into how those transfers unfolded. I don't mean to do this in some defence of Kane because I don't really feel like that, I'm just more interested in comparing the current situation to others and how they unfolded, the insight that can bring and what's to come.\n\n**Luka Modric**\n\nModric was the immediate person that came to mind when I found out Kane asked to leave last summer but agreed to stay another season. This is similar to Modric in 2011 who publicly wanted to sign for Chelsea, but his wish was refused. It was reported that Modric held talks with Abramovich on his yacht. Modric spoke to the press at the start of the season saying \"I reminded the chairman of our gentleman's agreement when we were in Dubrovnik last summer and I agreed a contract extension with Tottenham.  At that time, I had an open chat with Levy \u2013 that if a bigger club came in with a concrete offer, we would consider it and agree the best solution for all concerned. Now Levy doesn't want to talk to me and said there is no possibility that I can leave Spurs. He threatened me \u2013 he said if I didn't accept the club's stance, they would make me sit on the bench or in the stands.\" Modric refused to play in the opening game of the season when we lost 3-0.\n\nSimilar to Kane he stayed one more year and had his best season in a Spurs shirt. Problems returned before pre-season the next year with Modric refusing to attend training. Obviously afterwards he eventually joined Madrid that summer, for less than Chelsea offered the year before.\n\nSources:\nhttps:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/1267570-tottenham-hotspur-transfer-news-spurs-fine-modric-for-refusing-to-train\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2011\/jul\/10\/luka-modric-tottenham-hotspur-chelsea\n\n**Gareth Bale**\nThe summer Bale left he missed several games during the pre-season due to a reported and somewhat convenient glute muscle problem. He then later missed games due to a pain in his foot. According to the Guardian he was \"horrified by Levy's intransigence\" and could not believe Levy was blocking his transfer to Madrid. Eventually Bale began skipping training entirely as the end of the transfer window loomed. He claimed he would not return to training before the end of the window and did not play any of our opening games before moving to Madrid on deadline day for a record fee.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2013\/aug\/27\/gareth-bale-realmadrid\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2013\/aug\/27\/gareth-bale-realmadrid\n\n**Christian Eriksen**\n\nAccording to his agent, in 2018 there were apparently two English clubs and one foreign club who put in big money for Eriksen, with Levy not even considering it and Eriksen finding the moves 'not a must have'. Eriksen told the club shortly before the Champions League final that he wanted to leave. A few days after the final Eriksen told the press \"I feel that I am at a stage of my career where I would like to try something new. I have the deepest respect for everything that is happening at Tottenham and it would not be something negative to stay. But I have also said that I would like to try something new.\n I hope that something will be decided this summer. That is the plan. In football you never know when there could be a decision like that. It could be at any point. The best thing is always for it to happen quickly but in football things take time. Real Madrid is a step up but then it would take Real Madrid picking up the phone and making contact with Tottenham and say that they want Christian. It depends on the possibilities. If there are no exciting offers why shouldn\u2019t I stay at Tottenham? If I then sign a new contract depends on the conditions.\"\n\nEriksen was never reported to miss training that next season after no move developed, but he was benched for several games at the start of the season, before eventually starting a game and scoring in the NLD once the transfer window ended. Now this next part is all in recent memory so I'm sure everyone will have their own opinion, but Eriksen's form dropped that season and his role in the team was reduced as we had our terrible start which eventually got Poch fired. There was plenty of anger towards Eriksen at the time by fans. Tbh I always felt like his dip in performances was pretty in line with the rest of the team and many stats show he was still our most creative player despite his sporadic appearances. In the All or Nothing documentary Mourinho praised Eriksen for remaining very professional in his last few months for the club, consistently coming off the bench and creating more than our other midfielders during the match. Mourinho said that he just couldn't use a player who was so close to leaving and Eriksen, Levy and Mourinho all agreed it was best to move in January, leading to him joining Inter.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/football\/2019\/jun\/05\/tottenham-christian-eriksen-says-he-is-ready-for-a-new-challenge\n\nhttps:\/\/www.hitc.com\/en-gb\/2019\/06\/02\/report-suggests-what-christian-eriksens-told-spurs-about-his-fut\/\n\n\n**My thoughts**\n\nJust thought I'd share my take on this. I've seen a lot of people claim what is happening with Kane is more toxic and worse than what has happened before. I find that interesting just due to the clear similarities to these past transfers: talking to the press about wanting to leave, specifically mentioning other teams (tbf Kane didn't do this when he commented about KDB in response to Neville but I'm sure he could have avoided that if he wanted), gentlemen's agreements, making intentions clear before critical games of the season. Obviously there is a lot of differences in the timing of all these things across the 4 players and all situations are somewhat unique. I think it does show that us fans forget pretty quickly however, and I think talk about this ruining Kane's legacy with the club is pretty hyperbolic as none of this sentiment is held with the other three. Though I'm sure things will be very toxic if the worst possible thing happens on Sunday and this saga will be remembered next season as a key reason we are not playing in Europe. Which tbh is a pretty long list of reasons at this point.\n\nGoing forward with Kane he might take the Modric and Bale root of refusing to train or miss pre-season games. The Euros this summer will already effect the pre-season anyway so the whole situation will be interesting to see how it unfolds, especially with the new manager. Or he could take the Eriksen root and remain somewhat more professional but with still the potential for a negative cloud hanging over the club. I think many of us would have preferred it if we could have sold Eriksen half a season earlier, but I could be wrong.\n\nGiven what's happened, I'd personally want Kane sold as soon as possible if this is really the stance he is taking. I don't think it ever really works for clubs when they try to keep players who don't want to be there. Selling now would be selling high, and allow our new manager to immediately get started with the rebuild. I'd also mention that personally I would much rather have Kane go to City than the other realistic options of United and the much less likely Chelsea, and I imagine other Spurs fans would feel the same way. If Kane doesn't go to City this summer I think it becomes more likely he ends up at an even more sickening destination next season, probably for less money and a whole lot of negativity throughout. Sorry if I've gotten any details wrong or missed important stuff out. I'd be interested to see what others think.\n\nAnyway, COYS.",

        "self_text":"I\u2019ve been thinking constantly since Jose\u2019s departure from spurs about some of the team choices that Ryan Mason has made; the main ones being dropping Ndombele for Winks in a cup final and playing Dele consistently after seeing bang average performances from him bar a fancy wee nutmeg that he\u2019ll pull off. Both of these choices to me are absurd, especially considering how good Ndombele was for us during this season, with his ball retention and ability to make line-breaking passes being some of his best attributes, which could\u2019ve been used to our advantage against a high-press man city team, and it got me thinking about why he had decided to make these changes. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of Ryan Mason, but is he fully to blame?\n\nAfter Jose was sacked from Spurs, a lot of rumours started floating about twitter, one of which being that one of the final fallouts between him and Levy was due to the fact he was refusing to play players such as Dele, Winks and Bergwijn, with Levy wanting to play them due to the fact that it would up their market value so that we get more for them if we decided to sell them in the summer. We all know that Daniel Levy is very tight-fisted and is always trying to get as much money as humanly possible, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if this was true, and I believe this is.\nAnother rumour floating (might be true but I\u2019m not 100% sure) is that Levy sacked Jose while we were in 7th so that he could save an extra \u00a310m in fees towards him, once again highlighting his tight-fistedness. With there only being a couple of games left, there was no point in assigning a manager left, especially with the Mourinho sacking seeming to be a spur of the moment decision, so the best option is to have the U19 manager come in as caretaker as he knows the squad, but was he actually allowed to fully pick the squad?\n\nRyan Mason clearly loves Spurs and wants us to succeed as much as we all do, but I feel like he didn\u2019t have a proper say in some of the decisions that were made. Even in games when nothing is happening, Ndombele seems to try and create as much as he can and will create chances whenever he\u2019s on the pitch, so to leave him out to me is absolutely gobsmacking, and even yesterday against Villa he seemed to do more in the 20 minutes he was on the pitch he seemed to do more than Dele did in the entire 90. Because of these dodgy decisions, I feel like Levy has had a say in the teams and has told Mason to play players that may be leaving and who were not getting games under Jose such as Winks, Bergwijn and Dele, in an attempt to boost their market value so that they get as much money as possible. \n\nThis is a complete conspiracy, but it has just been on my mind and wanted to see what you guys thought about the entire situation.",

Qualifying means we finish above Spurs.\n\n2. It boosts our coefficient and soon the top two unqualified coefficient teams will qualify for the champions league so a season out of Europe will drop our currently high coefficient.\n\n3. All the youth can get a few games under their belts, we should be able to rest most of the 1st team based on the status of opponents.\n\n4. I imagine a lot of fans on Reddit have never seen us win a trophy in Europe and while it\u2019s not the biggest a trophy is a trophy if we can win it.\n\n5. More games to watch both on tv and at the stadium (be great after a year away for the fans) and again a great time to watch some of the youth players develop.\n\n6. While some of you say this competition is below us unfortunately that\u2019s where we are right now and we should be competing on all fronts of course we don\u2019t want to be in here we want to be in the champions league but any Europe is better than no Europe.\n\n7. Speaking of which we have 25 years of consecutive European football and I\u2019d like to keep that going.\n\n8. Money, while not as big as the other European competitions money is money and we can\u2019t afford to let any chance of cash go a miss.\n\n9. Some people think if we don\u2019t have Europe we will be top 4 or even title challenges. I don\u2019t think the majority of the 1st team will be playing in this competition so they can stay fresh and cause minimal disturbance to the weekend prem games.\n\n10. If we arnt in it Spurs will more than likely be and as unlikely it may be they could win this and I can\u2019t bare to see them lift a pint let alone a trophy.\n\n1st post and on mobile so sorry if the format is crazy",

Ten Hag of course made Ajax into a team that were playing beautiful football, and playing it well. I'm pro both of them from the small bits of knowledge I have. However, if someone has a more extensive knowledge on the two of them, I would love to hear your thoughts on where either could be positive and\/or negative. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping in mind the team we have, the types of players they've managed, the types of players that fit into their system, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate this is a big ask but I've watched just about every video there is and all I can find it info about what they've done with smaller clubs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!

        "self_text":"I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this post but it\u2019s about the club in general so I figured it was okay. As some of you may know, the women\u2019s team is seeing a ton of departures as the season ends as well as some contracts being rescinded in a very shameful way. The club did not achieve promotion this season so the offseason will be critical for adjustment and improvement. In general, the continued lack of investment in the women\u2019s side is very frustrating - even Arsenal can put together a sustainable and competitive women\u2019s team - so imo there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t. The last time I checked the team doesn\u2019t even have the opportunity to train at the massive new training ground - which makes no sense to me as they are part of the club. Giving the team the same access to the facilities used by the men\u2019s first team as well as the youth teams is literally the least FSG could do. If ownership is concerned about global reach there are tons of players from key markets available to sign on loan in the NWSL offseason (Chloe Logarzo, Kristie Mewis, Yuki Nagasato, etc.) so I\u2019m not sure why they are falling behind here. Women\u2019s football continues to grow and LFC is going to be left behind - not to mention the fact that the club could be missing out on various financial and marketing opportunities in the future (something FSG loves to utilize to boost revenue). I\u2019m hoping we can take some of that ESL energy and put it toward calling for more equal treatment for the women\u2019s team. The players and fans certainly deserve more.",

It can't be because of Jose, since he's been even worse under Mason. And it can't be because of his injury since he had the international break to recover.

Here in the States, it\u2019s taken a backseat as the competition for professional sports has always gone to Basketball or American football. I first started getting into the premier league around 2016. I didn\u2019t look into any of the clubs or any players to favor. I simply started watching. And from the beginning I was with Manchester City. I thought they had a good play style. Dominant, fast and skilled. I had no knowledge of the clubs history or anything like that. I loosely followed them up until the whole super league dilemma and I couldn\u2019t sit right to continue supporting them. I asked around for possible refuge in another club but never really found one I was attracted to. Then I came upon Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. After doing research into both the club it\u2019s fans and it\u2019s history and struggles, there isn\u2019t a club in English Football I want to support more. \n\nAny fast facts, legends, or important club events I should know about?

        "self_text":"I know and understand The potential of being spat on and booed here, but I just listened to the Men in Blazers podcast following the FA cup and am really, really confused at Michael Davies eviscerating Tuchel\u2019s ability to coach, stating primarily the lack of goals comparatively to Chelsea under Lampard. \n\nHe indicated that it doesn\u2019t take any kind of coach to just sit five guys back in the box and the 18 clean sheets is more or less trying not to lose, as opposed to trying to win. He gave some stat about the number of goals under Lampard in the first half being double what has been scored under Tuchel. This really perplexes me. From what I see, if Pulisec or Werner could hit the broad side of a barn or learn how to not be offsides, Tuchels goal diff vs Lampard would not be nearly as dramatic. So.... is this Davies guy just butt hurt and bitchy because of the FA loss, or is this\n\nI don\u2019t really know a Chelsea fan personally, and see the turnaround as quite astounding. The potential top four and FA and CL finals as things that probably wouldn\u2019t have occurred under Lampard. I\u2019ve actually enjoyed watching the turnaround but, what do real Chelsea fans think? Are you Tuchel fans, do you dislike the \u2018style\u2019, I really just want to know if this blazers dude is a shit example of a fan and just entitled, or is there is a actually a large component of Chelsea fans that doesn\u2019t like Tuchel and in lieu of wins would like a more attacking style but be mid pack.\n\nIt seems counter intuitive, and perhaps his tune will change after this weeks win or after you make top 4 or a CL win. But omg, please tell me this is not the common sentiment.",

This is slightly less of a threat this year due to the pandemic and these player's value may by similar next summer to this as the market picks up again.\n\nHowever the above players represent almost the entirety of Liverpool's first team midfield and attack with only Thiago, Jota and Jones outside this group.\n\nSome of these players aren't too concerning, Milner is approaching the end of his career, Henderson is unlikely to look for a further major move before the end of his career and The Ox, Shaqiri, Keita and Phillips are squad players who are not vital to Liverpool's future success.\n\nHowever Salah, Mane, Firmino, Van Dijk and Fabinho are all star players who will be difficult to replace and may be interested in playing elsewhere before their career ends. \n\nThis represents a significant threat to Liverpool, these players cost approximately \u00a3230m and it is unlikely that Liverpool can afford to replace them without receiving a significant transfer fee in return, something that becomes harder as their contracts tick down.\n\nI'm not sure how Liverpool approach this problem, from a business perspective Liverpool should be considering selling 2 or 3 of these players this summer to protect themselves financially but there is also the personal relationship and possibly most or all 5 will have personal expectations of signing a new contract this year.\n\nBut even this is a problem, these 5 players earn in the region of \u00a340m a year (before bonuses) and renewing all 5 could add \u00a310-20m to this bill. Can Liverpool afford that?\n\nLiverpool have a problem in front of them, the core of the team has two years left on their contracts and re-signing\/replacing them will be very expensive. How Klopp and FSG address this problem will be very interesting.",

        "self_text":"The 22-year-old Christian Pulisic is the most famous American footballer of all time, and the first American to score a goal in the UEFA Champions League Semifinal. Given his first name, nationality, fame, and other factors, many have inquired about or hypothesized Pulisic's political leanings.\n\nIn this post, I have compiled every reasonable piece of evidence I know of for each side of the traditional political spectrum. For each side, I'll start with weaker evidence and finish with the strongest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Right-Leaning \/ Conservative Evidence\n\n**American \/ Croatian Nationality**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christian_Pulisic#:~:text=Pulisic%20has%20scored%2015%20goals,team%20in%20the%20modern%20era)\n\nThe United States is more conservative than most first-world countries, including the majority of European ones. Since Pulisic plays in a European football league, people will naturally assume that he leans further right than most players in the clubs. Also of note is that Pulisic's paternal Grandfather was born in Croatia, and Christian is a citizen in that country. I cannot find confirmation, but I believe Croatians are known to be further right than most European countries as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Christian Religion**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/sportsspectrum.com\/sport\/soccer\/2021\/01\/21\/usmnt-christian-pulisic-closer-to-god\/)\n\nThere are a good deal of liberal Christians, particularly in the United States. The majority, however, are conservative. Besides his name literally being \"Christian,\" he has made it clear that he is a man of faith in interviews such as the one linked, in which he says he has grown closer to God. The interview is from January 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Patriotic Tattoo**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/tattooino.com\/sportsmen\/christian-pulisics-tattoos\/#:~:text=A%20few%20tattoos%20can%20be,keen%20pulsating%20desire%20which%20transcends)\n\nWhile being Patriotic does not necessarily mean one is conservative, there is certainly a strong correlation between the two. Pulisic has a tattoo of a bald eagle in front of an American flag which takes up the majority of his upper left arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Tweet About Serena Williams Post Concerning Tension in the US**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/natedredge\/status\/1274909479901949952)\n\nIn June 2020, he liked a Tweet where Serena Williams discusses being tired of the division in the country. She talks about different groups that dislike each other (gay vs straight, Christians vs atheists), and says she is sick of that tension. She also says she is sick of the media, and people not being able to say what they think for fear of offending others. In general, conservatives aim to allow for more ideas to be acceptable, even if it means hurting some people. Liberals aim for more people to be accepted, even if it means some ideas get shut down. This, combined with the anti-media portion, is definitely a right-of-center mindset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Christian Pulisic Likes Mark Pulisic Tweet**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarkPulisic\/status\/1316054467557679106)\n\nIn October 2020, Christian Pulisic liked a Tweet form his father.\n\n&gt;I have travelled to many countries, I am extremely fortunate to have experienced and met people of all backgrounds and beliefs, and to see how they live.  Let\u2019s be careful right now how we speak about our home for self gratification ... we are so lucky. *(American Flag Symbol)*\n\nThe idea of feeling fortunate to meet people with many backgrounds is generally a left-leaning ideology. However, the idea of feeling fortunate to meet people with different beliefs is generally a right-leaning ideology. Saying to be careful about talking about our country, and that \"we are so lucky\" appears to be more conservative. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Seth Jahn's Post Against Antifa**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2021\/03\/christian-pulisic-liked-seth-jahn-instagram-post-shooting-antifa-chelsea-usmnt)\n\nThe number 1 thing people use in the argument that Pulisic is right-leaning, or even right-wing, is his liking of an Instagram post in early March. The post shows Seth Jahn, a former American footballer, in a room filled with dozens of guns. The post refers to Antifa as \"ANQUEEFA,\" and appears to imply that Jahn is planning on shooting any Antifa members that go near or threaten him. However, someone close with Pulisic has allegedly said that he blindly liked the post. It does not seem suspicious that the player himself has not confirmed that, as he has largely stayed out of politics throughout his young career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Left-Leaning \/ Liberal Evidence\n\n**Friendship with Streamer Richard \"Ninja\" Blevins**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ninja\/status\/1197315406404280320)\n\nNinja, the ultra-popular video game streamer famous for his Fortnite streams, has been associated with Pulisic on multiple occasions. Pulisic has liked multiple Ninja Tweets, and they have taken at least one picture together, and apparently played Fortnite online. Based on his Twitter history, Ninja is definitely on the left, as are the majority of popular streamers. While it's certainly plausible that two celebrities could hang out while having opposite political views, it is less common than many would think. However, I cannot confirm everyone Pulisic has collaborated with, or what their political leanings are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Discussion About Wearing a Mask**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fiuVjnUlmao?t=333)\n\nWhile a good number of right-leaning people are fine with masks, few would strongly encourage them or see them as a priority. In \"10 Things Christian Pulisic Can't Live Without,\" a January 2021 video from GQ Sports, Pulisic includes a Chelsea mask at the 5:33 mark. He states that the mask \"is obviously essential in the strange world that we live in nowadays so, um, yeah always, you know, have that on, uh, because you gotta protect yourself, you know, protect everyone else, stay safe.\"\n\nHe also mentions that he has a lot of those face masks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Anti-Trump Tweet from Lebron James**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/KingJames\/status\/911610455877021697)\n\nIn September 2017, Pulisic liked a Tweet from Lebron James, which is referring to then-president Donald Trump.\n\n&gt;U bum [@StephenCurry30](https:\/\/twitter.com\/StephenCurry30) already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up! \n\nWhile not all conservatives are Trump supporters, this liked tweet indicates that Pulisic is likely not far-right. In addition, Lebron James is known for views that are very far-left. Keep in mind, though, this Tweet (as well as the next two in this post) was back in 2017, when Pulisic had just turned 19. Beliefs can change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Anti-Trump, Possibly Pro-Clinton Tweet**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRickyDavila\/status\/897623359474814977)\n\nIn August 2017, Pulisic liked a Tweet saying \"She warned us all.\" 3 times. The main subject is a video of Hillary Clinton talking about Donald Trump, including his relationship with White Nationalists. While we have established that Pulisic is certainly anti-Trump, most conservatives against Trump would not like a video essentially endorsing the words of Clinton. Additionally, the video is from Now This, a leftist news source, and the Tweet is from Ricky Davila, a political commentator who is far-left by American standards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Obama Tweet**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/BarackObama\/status\/896523232098078720)\n\n In August 2017, The American liked a tweet from former president Barack Obama.\n\n&gt;\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...\"\n\nThe Tweet also includes a picture of Obama smiling at children whom appear to be of three different races. Liking a politician's Tweet appears to suggest that the liker would endorse that politician, particularly considering our last few pieces of evidence. The Tweet also concerns racism, something liberals see as more of a problem than conservatives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pulisic Likes Deandre Yedlin Tweet Implying Police Racism**\n\n[Information](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yedlinny\/status\/1267797238979444738)\n\nIn early June of 2020, Pulisic liked a Tweet from Yedlin, a fellow American footballer.\n\n&gt;A couple days after George Floyd\u2019s death, my grandfather texted me and told me he\u2019s glad that I am not living in the U.S. right now because he would fear for my life as a young black man. As days have passed, this text from my grandfather has not been able to leave my mind. \n\nThis is a very left-leaning Tweet, and the biggest piece of evidence we have that Pulisic is politically liberal. It directly references the death (now ruled murder) of George Floyd by a police officer, Derek Chauvin. While conservatives were split on the Chauvin verdict, very few agree with the notion that African American men have reason to be afraid of, or are discriminated against by police. This Tweet strongly implies racism within the police force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMake of this information what you will. Admittedly, I cannot say for certain which side, or how far to one side Pulisic is on. I'm sure people will have different opinions on the matter. But I can tell you what my educated guess is.\n\nI believe that Christian Pulisic is left-leaning, though he doesn't seem to want to get too involved with politics (he has put out few political statements, and most of his liked political tweets are from 2018 or earlier). He may not be as far left as some, but he still seems to be firmly on the liberal side of politics. While some of the evidence in the conservative section has me suspicious, I do believe that he didn't mean to like the \"shooting Antifa\" post, and his history of liked Tweets strongly point in the opposite direction.\n\nLet me know your thoughts; I'd love to hear them!",

You have been a great servant to the club. We will always remember your goals against Barcelona that won us the Champions League! Mane scored twice to put us in 3rd place. If you would have told me we would finish 3rd 2 or 3 months ago, i would have laughed. We have came back after a dreadful run of games to finish 3rd. This season is a season to forget. I honestly believe we could challenge for the title with our full squad. But the season is finally over. Its time for everyone to rest and recuperate. Leave your thoughts about the game below. Let's come back stronger! Thank you Gini again for all the memories if it is your last game! UP THE REDS!!",

        "self_text":"I'm sure you've realised like I have, we have completely lost the ability to play against any remotely decent competition. \n\nIn all domestic competitions, our last 12 matches against top 11 sides\\* have ended with us winning once, drawing once and losing an utterly embarrassing ten times\\*.\n\nOn top of that, the only games we haven't lost are hardly impressive - our only win comes away at Villa when they were really off it due to injuries and our only draw comes at Goodison Park, where Everton have been completely dreadful recently &amp; were missing Calvert-Lewin.\n\nWe now just look hopeless against any team that are half decent. We know this squad isn't the best, if we are poor against Man City then whatever, but even with fan support we looked hopeless against Villa yesterday &amp; were played off the park against a really mediocre Arsenal side. \n\nWhen was our last good performance against a decent side, at least one that wasn't completely ruined by injury? Beating Leeds 3-0 comes to mind but even then that was a deprived Leeds side (Llorente, Koch and Cooper were all injured, 3 of Leeds' 4 recognised CB's). Outside of that it would be going all the way back to November\/December for the games against Man City and Arsenal.\n\nOur massive drop off in these games is honestly really worrying and it hardly fills one with confidence when we take on Leicester on Sunday. Even if we agree the players aren't good enough, why are they completely unable to show up against slightly better opposition? Teams far below us still make upsets every now and then, where as we've just become this hurdle that smaller teams struggle passing but decent sides bypass with ease. While we were worse in the two seasons Juande Ramos was involved in, at least we won a cup in one &amp; had some upwards momentum once Redknapp took over in the other. This season has just been utterly awful and the trajectory of the club is completely downwards, more so than any season before Martin Jol.\n\nFull list of the 12 games included:  \nTottenham 1-3 Liverpool  \nTottenham 0-1 Chelsea  \nEverton 5-4 Tottenham (AET)  \nManchester City 3-0 Tottenham  \nWest Ham 2-1 Tottenham  \nArsenal 2-1 Tottenham  \nAston Villa 0-2 Tottenham  \nTottenham 1-3 Manchester United  \nEverton 2-2 Tottenham   \nManchester City 1-0 Tottenham  \nLeeds 3-1 Tottenham  \nTottenham 1-2 Aston Villa\n\n\\*To clarify, I chose top 11 as I think there's a substantial gap between Villa (11th) and Wolves (12th) - 7 points, is the point of the table that crosses positive &amp; negative goal difference and I think most would agree if Grealish was fit all season they'd be higher in the table (probably higher than us...)",

Centerback or CDM.\n\nMidfielders\n\nBakayoko (Keep)\n\nThis is probably a controversial take but I think he should get a chance atleast over the summer to show his worth .

He's probably our best crosser of the ball and has popped up with some important goals as well.\n\nThings get much more interesting when it comes to first team players with deals expiring in June 2022:\n\n* Paul Dummett\n* Matty Longstaff\n* Fabian Schar\n* Sean Longstaff\n* Florian Lejeune\n* Yoshinori Muto\n\nI'd be in favour of retaining all of them except **Muto**. \n\nThe **Longstaffs** have been absolutely shafted (pun intended) by Bruce this season and it would be a shame to lose them. \n\n**Dummett** has proven beyond doubt that he's our best left back and provides much needed cover in the centre of defence when needed.\n\n**Schar** is quality, even if his discipline is sometimes questionable.\n\n**Lejeune** has some fitness questions, but is one of our best defenders.\n\nWho do you want to keep?",

        "self_text":"Another great display from Nakamba last night left me thinking about two other former mid-table defensive mids who have gone on to top European clubs, Kante being the obvious choice and Idrissa Gueye the other. Neither of them are the biggest but they get through a huge amount of work and Nakamba is very much in this mould. I'm convinced that the result against Palace would have been different had we brought Nakamba on at the start of the second half to shore up our midfield and wonder if he can kick on and be the DM that we need.   \n\n\nDespite his stats being great I don't think we ever really appreciated Gueye, likely due to him being around during a pretty horrible time for us. We are also pretty bad in general when comparing our players to those in other teams - see the loons in this sub wanting to bring in Dwight McNeil over Traore. McNeil scored 2 goals in the prem this season compared to Traore nabbing 7 which is a very decent return for a winger. I've not watched enough of Sheffield United this season to know if Berge would be an upgrade on Nakamba, but I can't help but think this is typical of our fanbase to look at other teams players with rose tinted glasses whilst concentrating on the limitations of our own. \n\nDean Smith prefers Luiz when he expects us to have more possession and Nakamba for the opposite, ideally we would have a player sitting there who had the best skills of both but players of that calibre are rare and expensive (see Thomas Partey to Arsenal for \u00a345mil). We've seen Nakamba's passing get better throughout his time at the club and if he continues to show that growth I think we could have a Kante-lite player on our hands. \n\nSo, do we still need to buy another DM this summer? I'd rather we go all out for a winger upgrade as despite El Goalzi's 10 goal haul this campaign I'm still not convinced by him as a starter, although he definitely has a place in our squad.",

        "self_text":"In 1996 Arsenal hired an unproven manager who none of the fans had heard of, in his first season the team performed pretty well and saw moderate success, in the second season we were terrible the first half of the season and at Christmas sat in 6th, bearing in mind that at the time the only massive teams were Man United and Liverpool unlike today when there's 5 or 6 other teams at the top. The manager changed the tactics at Christmas and the club killed it in the second half of the season.\n\nI'm not saying that Arteta is going to be Wenger, but I am saying that all of you crying for Arteta to be gone would have been crying for Wenger's head at Christmas in his second season too.\n\nOver the last two thirds of the season we sit 2nd in the league, that's a huge portion of the season, and we have a young core that actually looks quality, Saka, ESR, Tierney, Pepe, Gabriel, Holding, Willock are all U25 and hopefully Saliba is in the mix too. How about instead of hoping for the club to fail you give it another year and allow Arteta to actually get some signings in and see how the club progresses next season.",

        "self_text":"There has been a lot of discussion whether qualifying for Europa Conference League would be beneficial for Arsenal. Most of the debate so far has been focused on whether the financial benefits of qualification would outweigh the negative impact of the distraction it would cause. I don't think financially European Conference League matters all that much for a club of Arsenal's caliber. I also do agree that lack of distraction of European football could benefit our league performance. However, I want to mention another benefit of qualification that I haven't seen brought up and that's UEFA coefficient points.\n\nStarting from the 2024\/2025 season, Champions League will have 4 additional slots and 2 of those slots will go to clubs with the highest club coefficients that have not qualified to Champions League through the league but qualified for Europa League or European Conference League ([source](https:\/\/www.uefa.com\/uefachampionsleague\/news\/0268-12157d69ce2d-9f011c70f6fa-1000--new-champions-league-format-explained\/)). Coefficient ratings are calculated based on the performance of teams in Europe during the last 5 seasons. We are currently 10th in [coefficient ratings](https:\/\/www.uefa.com\/memberassociations\/uefarankings\/club\/#\/yr\/2021). As things stand, the only team above us that will not qualify for CL through the league is Juventus. And it would be unlikely for 2 of the teams above us to miss qualification to CL at the same time in the following seasons. What that means is retaining a high UEFA coefficient rating would make it much more likelier for us to qualify for CL starting from 2024.\n\nHowever, if we qualify for no European football for next season, that will mean we will get 0 points for the 2021\/2022 season and that will make it less likely to qualify through that route. Having 0 points from next season will negatively impact our chances to qualify for CL for the first three seasons of the new format.\n\nFor this reason, I think qualifying for Europa Conference League will be the lesser of two evils. We should do well in that competition even if we only play youngsters and back-ups, which will allow us to retain a high coefficient standing without having a huge negative impact on our league performance.",

        "self_text":"Hi guys, as the season just ended, I guess it's time we give our evaluations for the players of the team. I need to remind you it's subjective, and that I do not have an agenda against an algerian player. I prefer to be right in a player i'd underrated that wrong in a player I overrate.\n\nLet's go :\n\n***GK***\n\n**Fabianski** : Starter, and it's obvious. He had a few blunders that made us lose points, but he saved our asses so many times I won't blame him. He has almost everything, and is really reassuring. Only problems are his age and his fitness. I guess we need an other number 1bis who can take over. Worst case it can wait one year but it'd be great to sort it now. 8.5\/10\n\n**Randolph** : We never think about him but he is such an important transfer as he is competent as a number 2. He isn't perfect, a bit mistake prone, but can definitively help when needed. In his role, he was perfect this season. Way better than Roberto &amp; Martin. By the way, it seems the Martin fanboy left? 7\/10\n\nTrott : No idea what to do with him or his potential.\n\n***Defenders*** \n\n**Ogbonna** : Maybe my Hammer of the Season. He was shaky under Bilic, but played under an injury. He was good under Moyes the first time, quite benched by Pellegrini, yet nowhere near bad, but too much rotation. Since Moyes has been back, the Italian has been incredible, scored a few key goals, and reassuring. I just feel confident when he plays, and his distribution is good. His inury cost us a few points sadly. From what I understand, he will miss the euro and that's BS 9\/10\n\n**Dawson** : Big surprise, me included. I thought he would never play and his first twenty minutes against Southampton weren't good. Then he kicked Adams, and was reliable. A few bad games, when he wasn't playing with Oggy, but as soon the italian was back, he was good again. Decent solution, plays simple. Stupidiest red card against Newcastle though maybe 7.5\/10\n\n**Diop** : Hard to say. I really hoped Moyes management and style would make him improve, sadly, it doesn't. He is not dog shit, and had a few very good games but he isn't reassuring at all, both with Oggy or Dawson. I think his better pairing is with Balbuena. He can score the odd goal. I would keep him for the bench, I think Moyes rates him enough as he still came in. 6.5\/10\n\n**Balbuena** : As I said, I think he plays better with Diop. He had a patch of games this season when he was great, and was never really bad. If he were to leave, I'd understand but I'll remember him as a quite good player who tried his best. 6.5\/10\n\n**Cresswell** : back from the deads. He has been really regular this season, and provided so many assists. A bit timid at times, but not so much goals because of him. I remember we complained about his lack of commitment in some challenges the past seasons that cost us goals. He was better this year. And a threat on set pieces 7.5\/10\n\n**Coufal** : Incredible pick. Played almost all the time, almost never bad, a few assists, perfect spirit. Love him. I just wished he could have scored one goal 8.5\/10\n\n**Johnson** : I don't want to dislike him, he isn\"t even bad but I'm scared he isn't at the level expected. He is 23 yet.Still, a decent option because of his adaptability, and a great goal against Brighton, but god, the run of games when he came in and we kept conceeding... 5.5\/10\n\n**Masuaku**: Sadly, too many injuries for him to have a full season, and I wonder what to do as he can take a spot over Fornals or Benrahma. His end product isn't good enough,but at least, he moves and tries to offer something. And Cresswell behind him covers enough. 7\/10\n\n**Friedericks** : He can't be a starter in this team as Coufal is way better, still a decent option to give pace \u00e0 la Masuaku. He wasn't bad when he played but didn't contribute much. Still a positive rating 6\/10\n\n**Alves**  : Maybe next season?\n\n***Midfielders*** \n\n**Rice** : His injury cost us a bit also. But still, what a player he is becoming. He keeps improving, under Pellegrini, then under Moyes. Also, he keeps playing toward the opposition way better. He isn't only a defensive player but way more complete, especially since Soucek came. The conception than Soucek drives the team forward is quite wrong imo was Soucek holds the defensive part well and that's Rice who counters. He brings verticality, directness, and had a few great runs this season. Love him. 9\/10\n\n**Soucek** : A monster during the first part of the season, a bit more timid after since his red card, his goal against WBA was soooo important. Polyvalent player, defends, wins the balls, gives it, plays simple and scores. He helps the CBs so much. A true star in the team 8.5\/10\n\n**Noble** : Didn't play that much, got criticized a lot for no reason (we didn't score with Noble on the pitch, of course, he played when we were shit or against Chelsea as a number 10...) I feel Moyes wants to reinvent him but he is better as a backup solution or closing games. He did the job when Rice was injured. I hope he will enjoy Jesenice next year. 7\/10\n\n**Fornals** : The best thing Pellegrini did. Fornals could be way better if he scored more, but then he would play for Liverpool. Such a hard worker, who can keep the ball on the floor when we were playing crazy direct counter attacks. Seems like a lovely guy, and has some flair. Starter for me. 7.75\/10\n\n**Lingard** : Most of us were wrong about him. We were happy it was only a loan, now, we want a full time transfer. He had so much desire at first and it shown. He was decivise in bringing a new breath of life in the team. The last few games, he was less good, but nowhere near bad as some said. He has something really special in his passing and plays differently than the others : 8.5\/10\n\n**Lanzini** ; Didn't play much, was a rotation solution and that's normal. Crazy goal against Sprus that kept the spirit we were having, a few annonymous games and a great performance against a midfieldless Burnley. Has he not been injured at Everton, who knows... A servant of the club I respect a lot. 6.25\/10\n\n**Benrahma** : Of course, the hard one. I'm not a big fan, yet I do enjoy his way of playing forward, and vertical. That's something we really lack, and Lingard and Rice do that a well. We often give the ball on the sides toooo often. He can drible, he can assist, he defends, he can score, yet, something is missing. Some will say that's the trust of the manager. Maybe. I feel he lacks of consistency. Not a definitive starter for me anyways, but he had this season to learn and improve. Let's judge next year. 7.5\/10\n\n**Bowen** : God I really like him. A key player in our safety last season, he is good by period of time. If we have to compare, I prefer him as a player over Benrahma, but they could\/should rotate according the opposition and how they are. I just like the way he plays, but he should be more consistent. But he can do many good things and I wished he scored yesterday.\n\n**Yarmolenko** : Not a good season at all. Thanks for the goal against Chelsea last season though. You helped saving us. I think there were one time when he made a big rush to save a ball. Good to go to save money and space for me 4\/10\n\n***Forward(s) : \n\n**Antonio** : We had to rely on him and he delivered. Fitness is an issue, but he can score in any position. Him drifintg on the sides isn't bad as he can cross, and Lingard\/Bowen can take the spot. And he brings such a positive energy 8.25\/10\n\n**Mipo** :  One guy I really like here said Moyes ruined him after Man U. I don't think it's true as he didn't even try. He then scored in the youth. Maybe a loan next year? NR\n\n____\nThe others :\n\n**Roberto** : Thanks god\n\n**Snodgrass** : He played not so much, except the league cup. I'm sad he didn't play much for WBA\n\n**Diangana** : Selling him made us angry but he wouldn't have been better than Lingard, Benrahma or Bowen. I'm not so upset after all.\n\n**Haller** : Of course, having him for 6 more months wouldn't have hurt, he scored a few key goals but I never felt the heart was there. No bad blood, but not a good fit. May you smash Ado Den Hag and Sparta Rotterdam 6\/10\n\n___\n**David Moyes**\n\nIncredible job from him. I feel he learnt from his faillures, and was adapting enough to what he had, and what he faced.\n\nI liked how we could play 4 or 5 at the back. At the end, it wasn't even a discussion. We played.  The team was enough forward going and he almost never tried to close a game by putting 3 more defenders. His man management was also not that conservative, but a bit timid at moments.\n\nI won't talk about the transfers as I'm not sure about what input he had, but he was often seen scooting opposition. The guy did a great job. 9\/10\n\nAs I said, it's purely subjective, so i'd rather hear different oppinions than \"you gave X 7\/10 and Y 7.5\/10 when it should be the opposite\"\n\nLove",

        "self_text":"# Introduction\n\nFor the first time since the 2016-17 season, Manchester United are in a European final. Of course, last time round, we beat Ajax 2-0 in the Europa League final to win the whole thing and secure Champions League football following a 6th-placed finish in the Premier League. Who was in our starting XI, who was on our bench and where are they now? More importantly, how different was it from the team we've got currently?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sergio Romero\n\nRomero was our Europa League keeper that season, and since his reliability between the sticks led us to the final, Jos\u00e9 decided to trust his second-choice keeper and play him over David de Gea. That trust ended up being repaid with a win and a clean sheet from the Argentine. For the longest time, Romero was arguably the best 2nd-choice goalkeeper in the Premier League, but with the emergence of Dean Henderson combined with Solskjaer giving Romero the cold shoulder (even Lee Grant is ahead of him in the pecking order these days), he looks certain to leave this summer at the end of his contract. I personally feel that it's a shame how he's been treated given his service towards the club, but hopefully, he'll find success wherever he chooses to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Antonio Valencia\n\nThe recently-retired Ecuadorian played at rightback in a back four in the 2017 final in addition to wearing the captain's armband. Whilst a regular presence down the right wing under Fergie, Moyes, van Gaal and Mourinho (ah, a proper RW; those were the days), it's generally agreed that he was past the peak of his powers by the time Ole became our manager, and so he left United for the Ecuadorian club LDU Quito at the end of his contract during the summer following the 2018-19 season (Mourinho's last and Solskjaer's first season in charge). He of course retired this year, but is still due a testimonial thanks to spending ten years at Man United.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chris Smalling\n\nOne of our two centrebacks in the final, Smalling assisted Mkhitaryan for our second goal of the match courtesy of a Juan Mata corner. Smalling (or Smalldini as he is affectionately known) was one of our regular starters following SAF's retirement, especially in LVG's second season (or perhaps that was his twin brother Mike?). A solid old-school centreback, his ball-playing skills were considered inadequate for the style of football that Ole wanted us to play and so he was loaned to Roma before Ole's first full season in charge; he ended up performing very well for the Serie A side and so was sold for \u00a313.6 million the following season. He spent ten seasons at United in total (nine if you discount the season he spent on loan to Roma); not bad for a defender who started out his career in the Isthmian League.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Daley Blind\n\nOur other centreback in the final, Blind is one of those players whom I wish had stayed for longer at Man United. He wasn't particularly pacey, but his vision and versatility (being able to play at DM, CB or LB) were truly fantastic. A classic LVG signing, Mourinho never seemed to be Blind's biggest fan (often playing Jones or Rojo ahead of him) and he returned to his former club, Ajax, at the end of the 2017-18 season, where he remains. Always professional and willing to play in multiple positions, I personally feel as if Blind had more to offer, but what's done is done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Matteo Darmian\n\nPlaying at leftback in the final , Darmian is one of those LVG signings who wasn't bad *per se* but who just never seemed to kick on. As with quite a few of van Gaal's signings, Jos\u00e9 wasn't a big fan of him, and Ole didn't seem to rate him either. Eventually, he was sold to Serie A outfit Parma at the end of the 2018-19 season; whilst still contracted to Parma, he most recently played for Inter Milan on loan. Whether his United career would have fared better had van Gaal stayed is difficult to tell, but his time at the club consisted of far less drama than some of LVG's other signings (a low bar, I know), so he's got that going for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Ander Herrera\n\nOur sole DM in the final (wait, you can do that?), Herrera's exit from United was definitely one of the most frustrating in recent years. Despite being our POTY in the 2016-17 season and winning MOTM in the Europa League final, the board didn't seem to respect his contributions, and combined with the ridiculous wages which Alexis S\u00e1nchez was on at the time, Herrera left for PSG on a free at the end of the 2018-19 season, leaving a void in our midfield which, in my opinion, has yet to be filled. So long, Ander; I'll always remember you spitting on City's badge and getting Gerrard sent off in his final game against us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Juan Mata\n\nMata played on the right in the final, and he took the corner which led to our second goal. Signed by Moyes following some blistering form at Chelsea, we've never really found the perfect position for him, and have played him variously at #10, on the wing or as a second striker. No-one can deny his vision, his decision-making or his skill at set-pieces, but at 33 and progressively getting less and less game time, it seems as if his time as a player may be up this summer. Whether or not he'll stay at United in a coaching or ambassadorial role remains to be seen, but as a model professional who can put in world-class performances on his day, he's been one of my favourite United players of the post-SAF era.\n\n# \n\n# Marouane Fellaini\n\nFrom one David Moyes signing to another, Fellaini played in central midfield during the final (surprisingly, he didn't score a last-minute winner as he was wont to do during his time here). His rough and direct style of play never endeared him to United fans, and many took his signing as a departure from how we played under Fergie, but he was a beast in the air and his first touch was exquisite. He perhaps started more games than he ought to have, and following Ole's arrival, game time became limited; thus, he was sold to Chinese club Shandong Luneng at the end of the 2018-19 season, for whom he continues to play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Paul Pogba\n\nI can't believe that I have to tell my grandchildren that Marouane Fellaini once played in central midfield alongside Paul Pogba in a European final. Anyway, despite signing him for what was then a world-record fee, Jos\u00e9 never seemed to get along with Pogba, and seemingly every transfer window was filled with rumours of him returning to Juventus or going to Real Madrid, but he's somehow still here despite what Raiola has said. Anyway, he scored the opener against Ajax last time round, and it seems certain that he'll play a big role on Wednesday as well; what happens after that, I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nFor whatever reason, Mkhitaryan played on the left in the final and scored the second goal which sealed our victory. In his first season and at the start of his second season, he looked like an absolutely class player, but he ran into some poor form and couldn't a consistent run of games after that. He was eventually swapped for Alexis S\u00e1nchez in January 2018 in what has to be the worst swap move in history for both sides; nowadays, he plays for Roma alongside Smalldini.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Marcus Rashford\n\nDr Marcus Rashford MBE broke into the first team under van Gaal but never seemed to be comfortable under Mourinho. Nonetheless, he started as the lone man up top in the final and it's probable that he'll start on Wednesday as well (albeit on the wing). We'll see if he can get on the scoresheet this time round.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose were our starters. Only four of them (Romero, Mata, Pogba and Rashford) are still at the club, and out of those four, Romero's gone in the summer, Mata's probably gone as well, Pogba may or may not sign da ting and Rashford will still definitely be here next season. Pogba's a nailed-on starter on Wednesday, and Rashford will also probably get a start, but Mata probably won't feature despite being in the squad and Romero isn't even going to Poland. Our starting XI will thus look very different from how it looked four years ago; in fact, many of the players who will feature weren't even at the club four years ago! For completeness, let's look at the bench as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# David de Gea\n\nOur first-choice goalkeeper since Edwin van der Sar's departure, DDG nonetheless was on the bench during the final, and as tends to happen with keepers who are on the bench, his services weren't required. It'll be *really* interesting to see if he starts on Wednesday and if he'll still be here at the start of next season; perhaps a Europa League win will serve as his last hurrah? If I'm not mistaken, he's actually due a testimonial now, having served the club for ten years, and regardless of whether or not he stays after this season, he'll hopefully be fondly remembered as one of the bright sparks of our post-Fergie slump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Phil Jones\n\nOnce described as the next Duncan Edwards, it's fair to say that the career of the perennially-injured Phil Jones has unfortunately not panned out quite as he had hoped. Despite being eligible for a testimonial, he reportedly turned it down as he thought that no-one would show up, which just makes me sad. Anyway, he was on the bench last time round, but isn't even in the squad for Wednesday's match. Rather amusingly, if DDG does leave this summer, that'll mean that Jones is one of only two players left at the club who played under Fergie (the other being Pogba). For all his injuries, Phil can nonetheless take solace in the fact that he has still won more Premier League titles than Steven Gerrard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Timothy Fosu-Mensah\n\nI'm not sure where he would've played had he come on, given that he seems to play every position imaginable, but that point is rather moot as he remained on the bench for the entire game. Once seen as a promising young talent, injuries and failed loan moves have severely hampered his career, and despite seeming to be reintegrated into the team last season following an injury crisis, his lack of game time meant that he was ultimately sold to Bayer Leverkusen in January of this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Jesse Lingard\n\nComing on for Mkhitaryan in the 74th minute, it's fair to say that Lingard's time at United has been rather mixed at best. Despite his good work ethic and his occasional moments of brilliance, he has never really managed to kick on at United (although his goals won us the FA Cup in the 2015-16 season and Champions League football last season). He was loaned to West Ham in January this season, where he has been absolutely brilliant; he fully deserves European football next season. He's still technically at the club, but it seems likely that we'll sell him to West Ham this summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Michael Carrick\n\nCarrick, to me, was a great example of a player who wasn't fully appreciated by many fans until he left. Being constantly overlooked by multiple England managers, Carrick was nonetheless a superb servant for the club, and he continued to play until the 2017-18 season when he finally retired to join our coaching staff. He was on the bench for the Europa League final, though he ultimately didn't get a kick of the ball.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Wayne Rooney\n\nRooney surely needs no introduction. Though no doubt a truly world-class striker at his peak (and my favourite player growing up), many United fans felt that he was past it under van Gaal, and when Mourinho arrived, it seemed like just a matter of time before Rooney left for pastures new. Nonetheless, as the club's record goal-scorer and team captain, Rooney was subbed on in the 90th minute as a final farewell to the fans before returning to Everton that summer. He of course now manages the dumpster fire that is Derby County, where he'll probably keep his job next season if for no other reason than the fact that no-one else is willing to go anywhere near that poisoned chalice of a managerial job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anthony Martial\n\nAnother LVG signing who was shafted under Jos\u00e9, Martial came on to replace Rashford in the 84th minute. He appeared to experience a resurgence under OGS last season, returning his best goals tally ever, but this season has been rather poor thanks to a lack of goals and a long injury. Some fans want him to leave this summer, whereas others continue to back him; with Cavani at #9, however, it seems as if Martial is going to have to return to the wings for the foreseeable future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that was our bench. Interestingly, out of the seven players listed, four of them are still at the club (though Jones and Lingard don't play). It's interesting to look at the young Ajax team we faced, BTW, and see where they are now; only two of their starters still play for Ajax. The Ajax players we faced included the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Hakim Ziyech and Bertrand Traor\u00e9. Also, their bench included a young player by the name of Donny van de Beek, who looked class in the twenty minutes that he played; I wonder where he is now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, it's interesting to see how just how different our team looked four years ago. No doubt our chaotic transfer policy under Ed Woodward is largely responsible for this. Hopefully, most of the players who Ole has signed will still be here in four years' time, and hopefully, we'll bring that trophy home on Wednesday. GGMU!",
