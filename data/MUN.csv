practiceyourart,1601300853.0,j1cato,9.0,1.0,"I know we have a transfer thread, but the alarm bells have been steadily appearing bit by the bit the last two weeks enough that I went from trusting the board to the right decisions, to wondering what will happen to us this year.

Departures: Coutinho, Perisic, Thiago

Likely Departures: Cuissance, Martinez

**5 players (likely) leaving.**

Arrivals: Sane

**1 player arriving.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not counting the goat himself Odriozola, Fein, or Musiala because none of these players will be used for relevant minutes. Does anybody see what's wrong with the picture here? 5 players leaving, 1 player coming in. I know that corona has hit our club, and there's a rumor of a 100-150m euros loss from Bayern, but.. what the fuck? I don't see any other top end, medium, or lower tier club selling so many of their players without an equivalent amount coming back. 

Liverpool that's going to likely be the biggest obstacle in the CL, added Thiago, a world class midfielder, LB and ST depth and so far without losing anyone. Atletico lost a bum like Morata and signed and over the hill but still class Suarez. Madrid has stayed the same, and Barcelona has sent their old players packing and got new replacements, City as usual spending 9 figures more on defenders, because half a billion is not enough during Pep's tenure. Pep really needs some backing here, he's struggling. Chelsea spent a quarter of a billion dollars, even Spurs of all teams are spending. United have Woodward, so they don't count.

You see the memo, none of these teams have gotten weaker. A lot maybe stagnated or stayed the same, but none are selling their bench players like it's a fucking firesale. Kalle said that Lewandowski went to him once we won the final on that day telling him that one of the reasons we won was because of our depth. And then Flick, Goretzka, Kimmich, and Lewandowski since then have given interviews stating that we need depth. And as far as I know this transfer season is the longest yet, meanwhile our board has decided to sell a lot more players than bring in.

[https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oKRdXh5QW4I/TvlAp411qbI/AAAAAAAAYpI/aL7FoWm5wCs/s1600/0abadsanta.gif](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oKRdXh5QW4I/TvlAp411qbI/AAAAAAAAYpI/aL7FoWm5wCs/s1600/0abadsanta.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm sure a RB is coming in, even if Brazzo was caught sleeping on the job for the entire year trying to sign Dest. Don't really care if we got him, just rather get someone. Lets assume our board isn't fully run on autopilot which leaves us for midfield:

Wings: Sane, Gnabry, Coman (3)

Mid: Mueller, Goretzka, Kimmich, Tolisso (4)

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck is going here? Ok, maybe someone else comes in but unless we have one of the best 1 week transfer runs ever made, this looks like we are heading into the most congested/busy season in the history of the sport with 4 players for 3 positions. For fun and giggles, lets compare our mid from last season:

Mid: Mueller, Goretzka, Kimmich, Tolisso...... Thiago, Martinez, Cuissance, Coutinho (8)

For my history of arm chair coaching for many years, you need 7 solid players for these 3 positions to be covered with proper depth.

&amp;#x200B;

How the hell does it make sense to sell/send back from loan half our 8 central midfielders and with 1 week left, we haven't fucking replaced any of them? I'm not counting Fein/Musiala because if Flick believed in them, Mueller and Kimmich would have been resting on the bench vs Hoffenheim. If we kept our players, our midfield would have been completely different then. Why the hell are we considering selling Cuissance and Javi when we desperately need some quality bodies?

This is on par so far to be the worst transfer season we've ever done, unless some absolute magic is pulled out of nowhere because we're actively hurting our team rather than stagnating or keeping par the course.",fcbayern,"Regarding transfers, is our board on a drunken stupor?

midnightverses,1601286924.0,j196c5,18.0,1.0,"After 2013 Bayern's lack of success can be attributed to the lack of depth. We have had our squad cut down paper thin due to injuries in crucial stages of the season. If Bayern wants continued success they need to create a dynasty. Our current style of play and packed schedule will fucking kill the players this way. Thiago left, Martinez is leaving, Alaba and Cuisance may leave as well. The 3 loan signings last year added to our squad depth and we all know how that season went down. We dominated. And to continue to dominate we need to sign some players. I remember just 1-2 years back all of us were fuming over the board's lack of spending and wanted Brazzo and Hoeness to leave. Though I am particularly proud of the fact that our club is run very efficiently and doesn't overpay for players. We need to be smart. I am optimistic tho and I am sure the board will wake up after the defeat to Hoffenheim. Key players such as Lewa, Kimmich, Muller barely get rested and our squad is very injury prone. I remember when Real won 3 CLs their squad depth was crazy good.

So I have been planning on buying this years new authentic away shirt. But I'm a little confused with the sizing so I thought I'd write here to see if I could get som help. Okay, so I got last years replica shirt in M and it's a slight too big for me and I know the sizing is a little different when it comes too authentics and replicas. So what I'm wondering is if I should get the authentic in M or S for a little more slim fit. Thanks!

But the one thing I'm happy is that it's a clear message to the board memebers about bringing new players is really important we bought kouassi and nubel but they are no starters only player who has played well and been a starter is sane

And as dest is going to barca we should buy Aarons as soon as possible and also gotze as flick has spend some time with him during Germany days and he can make him a great player again 
 
Looking at Hernandez performance I have no doubt that guy is ready to prove himself this season and make a permanent spot in the starting 11 and as Davies is excellent I think we should play 
Pavard Sule Hernandez and Davies 
This back line has speed and it is solid 

And I'm glad that no one said something bad to any player I mean obv except kimmich and Neuer everyone was playing like they are playing for first time the passes were all wrong no creativity but we also know the reason 

So that's the thing bring in new players because we know flick can do his job incredibly well

One player specifically, David Alaba stood out, as he was obviously a star LB, and more recently a solid CB; but in an interview (not sure the exact source) he has mentioned he would love to play in the midfield. 

I think under Flick and the back line of Davies, Hernandez, Sule, and Pavard is a solid back line, so where would Alaba fit? I would love to see him expand to a holding mid field role if needed for some Bundesliga games, but it would be interesting to see how this would play out since the system we currently have is clearly working out excellently.

""David Alaba: ""Ich wünsche mir, dass meine vertragliche Situation nicht in der Öffentlichkeit geklärt wird. Daher haben mich ein paar Aussagen und Berichte der letzten Wochen verwundert und durchaus auch verletzt. Viele Dinge, die im Moment geschrieben und gesagt werden, stimmen einfach nicht und entsprechen nicht der Wahrheit. Ich möchte allen Beteiligten eine öffentliche Diskussion ersparen, auch wenn nicht alle Details bekannt sind. Ich habe mich bisher nie groß zu diesem Thema geäußert, weil ich mich ausschließlich auf unsere wichtigen Aufgaben mit dem FC Bayern fokussiert habe. Und das war auch gut so, denn letztendlich haben wir das Triple gewonnen. Das war alles, was die letzten Wochen und Monate gezählt hat. Dass ich diese einzigartige Geschichte aktiv mitgestalten durfte, macht mich jeden Tag aufs Neue stolz. Dieser Klub ist für mich nicht irgendein Verein, er ist Zuhause, Familie und Heimat. Seit 12 Jahren trage ich das legendäre rote Trikot, und das habe ich jeden einzelnen Tag mit Hingabe, Stolz und Leidenschaft getan und tue das auch immer noch. Das Wohl dieses fantastischen Klubs steht einfach über allen Dingen und ist auch mir sehr wichtig. Ich habe jeden Verantwortlichen, jeden Mitspieler, jeden Angestellten des Vereins ins Herz geschlossen. In einer Familie ist man durchaus mal anderer Meinung, man streitet sich vielleicht auch, aber es bleibt immer innerhalb der Familie. Das werde ich auch weiter beherzigen. Ich wünsche mir sehr, dass wir zeitnah eine Lösung finden, damit der Klub, die Verantwortlichen, meine Mitspieler aber auch die Fans wissen, woran sie sind.""""

David Alaba: ""I would like my contractual situation not to be clarified in public. Therefore, a few statements and reports of the last few weeks have surprised and even hurt me. Many things that are written and said at the moment are simply not true and do not correspond to the truth. I would like to spare all involved parties a public discussion, even if not all details are known. I have never made any big statements on this subject so far because I have focused exclusively on our important tasks with FC Bayern. And that was a good thing, because in the end we won the triple. That was all that counted in the last weeks and months. The fact that I was allowed to actively shape this unique story makes me proud every day. This club is not just any club to me, it is home, family and home. For 12 years I have been wearing the legendary red jersey, and I have done and still do that every single day with dedication, pride and passion. The well-being of this fantastic club is simply above all things and is also very important to me. I have taken every responsible person, every player, every employee of the club to my heart. In a family you may disagree, you may argue, but it always stays within the family. I will continue to take this to heart. I really hope that we can find a solution as soon as possible so that the club, the managers, my teammates and the fans know where they stand.

Instead he says if things doesn't improve he will consider other options. Personally its very immature to me. Its only been a season at one of the best clubs in the world what do you expect?

Ajvarmk,1599828172.0,iqppmk,2.0,1.0,"Hello Bavarians. I personally stopped playing games on PS ages ago, before when i did play i was always pissed how our player had such a low grade. 

It is truth that we always relied mostly on our team spirit and play style than individual stars but nevertheless we always had atleast couple of players that belonged in top 10 every year. 

This year is specially stupid, atleast for FIFA 21 ratings. The treble winners, the team that managed to score 40+ goals in a CL season, the team that won every CL game they had ... that team has only 1 player in the top 10 player ratings ... That team has only 3 players total in top 20 or better said 6 players (excluding Sane) in the top 100 players.. 

The GOATkeeper has well 3 keepers with higher ratings, for which i would agree maybe , but 2 years ago when he wasnt playing. 

There are bunch of players ahead of Thiago ... ""superstars"" that barely managed to get like 5 assists this season... But well, this in a way shows to me that there were always a level of jealousy of how our team is managed without having those huge money splashing around ... 

Just a post to spice things up in todays subreddit. :)

And while those are important, his contribution to the Bayern game is so much more. One of the main ways that Lewy helps out is by becoming a diversion. He is on that level where opposing teams know that in order to stop him, they will have to have 2-3 players mark him.

You might remember me posting a survey on “Fan Identification in Football” in this subreddit a few months ago as part of my bachelor thesis in Sport Management. I wanted to thank all of you who took part, as I reached almost 5.000(!) participants which made my research a lot more meaningful. Thanks to you I managed to score 94% on my thesis and graduated top of my class! My thesis will be published as an article in an academic journal in a few months time, which is something I am quite proud of. I was recently admitted to a masters degree program in Sport Management in Cologne/Germany, so I am excited for what’s to come! I thought I would post a short presentation of the results, your picks of favourite football clubs/players and general observations as some people were interested in the results and I want to give something back for all the support. The full thesis and findings will have to wait until the article is published, but I will definitely link it here once it is. Thanks again boys and girls, much love!

lucasribeiro61,1606579241.0,k2q1we,0.0,1.0," Quite simply, Gerd Muller was the greatest ever pure striker the world had ever seen. His technical skills were not sublime, and he was neither fast nor physically imposing, but the phenomenal German had the remarkable talent of being in the right place at the right time to put balls into nets. Nobody was capable of doing that like him.  The way he just set up the shot so easily is mesmerizing. When he joined, Bayern were in the second division, few years after they had been champions of europe for three consecutive seasons. An unforgettable story.

While Bayern are yet to commit an error leading to a goal in either the Bundesliga or the Champions League this season, two mistakes in their past three matches across the two competitions have prompted opposition chances.

Flick's side are still performing better in this regard than last season, with six errors leading to shots and one to a goal in the Bundesliga following his appointment and five attempts and one goal following mistakes over the same stretch in Europe.

Yet a careless trend is still concerning the Bayern boss, who has seen the team's passing accuracy in their own half drop from 94.7 per cent in the Champions League last term to 90.9 per cent this season, leaving an unprepared defence vulnerable.

""When we have the ball, we make too many mistakes,"" Flick told reporters ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Stuttgart. ""Nobody expects a bad pass, which means that you position yourself differently.

""We have to play more patiently from time to time and get more pressure on the ball. The defence, like the attack, is a team effort; everyone has to participate.

""It is clear that the concentration is not always at 100 per cent with so many, but we win the games. We have to make sure that we can get a grip on the few things that we don't do well, study the analysis and give the players solutions for the Stuttgart game.""

""Sule has enormous quality and gets all the help he needs. He has to fulfill his potential and, for that, he needs the necessary fitness. \[Benjamin\] Pavard will be in the squad. \[Corentin\] Tolisso will be there, too; he has trained well. Everything else will be seen after the final training session.""

""There is no alternative \[but to accept it\],"" said Flick. ""Of course, there are a few players missing, but we still have good depth in the squad. Things were clearly recognized and improved \[in the transfer window\]; Hasan \[Salihamidzic, sporting director\] did very well.

""We want to win the games. For this, it is important that we accept it. Only the team that accepts the circumstances and adapts best will be successful.""",fcbayern,'We make too many mistakes' - Flick concerned about errors creeping into Bayern Munich's play,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/k2hgvj/we_make_too_many_mistakes_flick_concerned_about/,2020-11-28 12:48:50

SpartaNNNN4,1606468777.0,k1xzn8,8.0,1.0," 

Hansi Flick said that he personally considers Gerd Müller to be the greatest footballer of all time. “For me in my childhood he was the coolest striker, because he scored the goals at the front with a matter of course that is no longer available. Well, Lewy still has it,” Flick said of his footballing idol.

Flick also reflected on meeting Müller during his playing days at [**Bayern Munich**](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/). He said that the “Bomber der Nation” was his absolute idol during his youth and said, “I was very happy when I got to know him. I wish him all the best for his birthday and health.”

It’s virtually impossible to mention Bayern without mentioning Gerd Müller. He scored 515 goals in only 576 matches across all competitions for Bayern and 68 times in only 62 matches for *Die Mannschaft*, including a goal in the 1974 **World Cup** final against The **Netherlands**. Only Pele (Santos, 643) and Lionel Messi (**FC Barcelona**, 636) have scored more goals for a single club in their careers despite the fact that league seasons were shorter back when Pele and Müller were playing.

&amp;#x200B;

He still holds the overall scoring record for Bayern as well as the all elusive single season scoring record (40), which [**Robert Lewandowski**](https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/bundesliga/players/236837/robert-lewandowski) has come close to equaling. The Polish ace finished last season with 34 Bundesliga goals and already has 10 goals from only 6 matches so far this season. If anyone can get close to Müller’s impressive single season tally, it’s Lewandowski and this season could be the season we see it happen.",fcbayern,Gerd Muller Greatest Footballer of all time - Hansi Flick,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/k1xzn8/gerd_muller_greatest_footballer_of_all_time_hansi/,2020-11-27 17:19:37

[This happened in the year 2000](https://tribuna.com/de/fcbayern/news/2020-10-30-als-diego-maradona-fur-bayern-spielte-das-machte-er-fur-lothar-matthaus/) when [Lothar Matthäus](https://tribuna.com/de/persons/lothar_matthaus/) took leave of professional football by playing his farewell game.

Not only Maradona was a guest of the Bavarians at that time: [Franz Beckenbauer](https://tribuna.com/de/persons/franz_beckenbauer/), Otto Rehhagel, [Giovanni Trapattoni](https://tribuna.com/de/persons/giovanni_trapattoni/), [Berti Vogts](https://tribuna.com/de/persons/berti_vogts/), Udo Lattek, but also rock singer Marius Müller-Westernhagen were on the pitch. Lothar was a certain size for football.

""Diego not only wants to take the kick-off, but also wants to play for 20 to 30 minutes,"" Matthäus said in a conversation with New York after receiving the promise: ""The fact that Diego is coming to me despite his serious health problems is a great honour for me and a real proof of our almost 20 years of friendship.

Even though Maradona gained a little weight at that time, he was still a world-class player when it came to working on the ball. Even Thomas Müller, who was 10 years old at the time, remembers the Argentinean magician:

""He already had a few pounds too much back then. But what he did on the ball was world class.""

SpartaNNNN4,1606288344.0,k0ndfc,21.0,1.0," The European champions have struggled to tie David Alaba down to a new contract but their fellow key player is ready to discuss fresh terms

Leon Goretzka has yet to sit down with Bayern Munich for contract talks but would be ready to hold discussions with the club.

The Germany midfielder has been a regular since joining Bayern from [Schalke](https://www.goal.com/en/team/schalke-04/cz4a6wmzx2obyisadhgaccx7b) in 2018 and still has around 18 months to run on his existing deal.

He featured 38 times in last season's treble-winning campaign and has been used on 10 occasions in all competitions already in 2020-21.

No Bayern player has recovered the ball more often than Goretzka in the Bundesliga this term (10.47 per game) and only Javi Martinez has more interceptions (3.03 per game compared to 2.76).

Bayern have struggled to tie down fellow key player David Alaba to a new deal, with the messy saga being played out in public in recent weeks, while Thiago Alcantata recently left for Liverpool when he had just a year remaining on his contract.

But Goretzka, who previously spent five seasons with fellow Bundesliga side Schalke, is open to talking over fresh terms.

""So far there have been no discussions held with me,"" he told reporters at a news conference ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Salzburg.

""I'm under contract for another year and a half so there is not a lot of pressure.

""But if Brazzo \[sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic\] or Hansi \[Flick\] approach me in the next few weeks then I will not refuse to talk to them.""

Goretzka has also started all four of Germany's Nations League matches this year, playing an hour of last week's humbling 6-0 loss against Spain.

It was Germany's heaviest defeat since they lost to Austria in a friendly in 1931 by the same scoreline and has led to questions being asked of long-serving boss Joachim Low.

### Flick happy with Bayern's point against Bremen

Article continues below

The German Football Association this week announced it would give Low time before assessing his future and Goretzka can understand the furore surrounding the defeat.

""If you lose a game that high then it is normal in our business to be criticised,"" he said. ""I didn't exactly wake up the next morning with a good feeling, either.

""For me personally, it was about processing the loss, taking some time and then switching focus back to challenges at Bayern.""",fcbayern,Leon Goretzka ready to open talks with Bayern Munich over new contract,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/k0ndfc/leon_goretzka_ready_to_open_talks_with_bayern/,2020-11-25 15:12:24

“David should take responsibility and decide for himself what is important to him,” he told [*Die Welt*](https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/plus220697360/Hans-Dieter-Flick-Ich-kenne-meine-Frau-seit-sie-15-ist.html). “David is a very fine person and a brilliant football player. He is very popular with the team and holds them together.”

There appears to be an internal divide at Bayern as to how to cope with the situation. [Sporting](https://www.goal.com/en/team/sporting-cp/7catg5lpivcmpf4xhggh6d8rk) director Hasan Salihamidzic has claimed that he does not see how a deal can be done, while CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has indicated that the door is still open to the 28-year-old if he wishes to come back to the table.

Bayern could be looking at a significant reshuffle of their defence in the coming months, with centre-back Jerome Boateng also out of contract in the summer of 2021.

Reports in [Germany](https://www.goal.com/en/team/germany/3l2t2db0c5ow2f7s7bhr6mij4) suggested that Bayern were ready to let the veteran player go at the end of his term, but Flick is not so clear.

“He’s a very important player,” he said. “He’s been with the club for over nine years and has been a treble winner twice during that time.",fcbayern,"Alaba should 'take responsibility' in Bayern Munich contract saga, says Flick",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/jzxxom/alaba_should_take_responsibility_in_bayern_munich/,2020-11-24 12:16:00

“You can tell that pretty easily from my playing time,” Gotze said. “In January, it was a two. Now it’s a nine, and on the way to 10.

“On the one hand, because I am playing almost every game. And on the other hand, because we are doing very well in every competition. This combination gives me a very good feeling.”

“In the summer we spoke openly about my future, about Bayern’s plans. They said that they value me as a person and a player and that they could have taken me back to Bayern again.

“Hansi \[Flick\] has as tight a schedule at Bayern as I do at PSV. He’s an excellent coach. To take over a team in the middle of the season and lead them to a treble is impressive.”

 “I don't want to rule out a return to the Bundesliga. Both options are conceivable for me. But now I'm in Eindhoven and I'm fully focused on our goals.”

SpartaNNNN4,1609333386.0,kn1vmv,19.0,1.0," For Pranjić, Van Gaal was the best coach he had in his long career: **“He was a perfectionist who cared about every little detail.” Danijel describes him as almost obsessed with his football philosophy. Danijel added: “In the long run, both players and the club itself benefited from Van Gaal’s philosophy.”** 

Van Gaal is a complicated guy, and that impacted his relationship with his players. One player who had problems with him was Franck Ribery. Pranjić explains that the two had a bad start, primarily due to Van Gaal’s decision to play Ribery as an attacking midfielder. Pranjić added: **“I think that if Franck had sometimes had better control of himself and obeyed the coach’s instructions, the mood in the team would have been better and, as a result, a longer collaboration with van Gaal might have been possible.”**

Danijel admits that Van Gaal didn’t have an easy personality, but emphasizes that he never had problems with the coach. The biggest problem was that **“we had no freedom whatsoever and there was rarely any sign of a relaxed atmosphere on the training pitch. That might work for one season.”**",fcbayern,Former Bayern Munich star Danijel Pranjić blames Franck Ribery for Van Gaal’s dismissal,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kn1vmv/former_bayern_munich_star_danijel_pranjić_blames/,2020-12-30 21:03:06

mnlg,1608801294.0,kjccn7,0.0,1.0,"Hello everyone. I am from Italy. I am not a fan, but not a rival either; I respect Bayern and its history.

Some time ago, one of my relatives passed away and I came into possession of a small Bayern banner they had. I don't know exactly how they acquired it and I guess I will never know. From what I know they weren't a fan either, but they might have received it as a gift from one of their customers (they operated a restaurant in a pretty touristic place), either a team/staff member or a fan.

I believe it is at the very least 35 years old, possibly 40+.

If I am not asking too much, I would appreciate your help in identifying the signatures (if possible), dating it more precisely and figuring out what value it might have, if any.

Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge gave an update on Alaba’s contract situation and things do not sound promising.

“Bayern did everything we could to try and reach an agreement,” Rummenigge said (as captured by the [**Daily Mail**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-9074965/Bayern-Munich-chief-Karl-Heinz-Rummenigge-appears-accept-David-Alaba-leave-free.html)). “We had a lot of conversations, but we wanted answers from him by the end of October. This didn’t happen and I don’t know if we’ll return to the negotiations.”

Rummenigge wants it to be known that he feels that the club has done everything possible to make it work with Alaba.

“What I want to be clear about is that our offer showed exactly how much we value him, but he didn’t accept it,” said Rummenigge.

When asked about a potential move to [**Real Madrid**](https://www.managingmadrid.com/) for Alaba, Rummenigge brushed off the speculation, but did not sound too optimistic about the chances of the two parties getting together.

“I don’t know anything about the Real Madrid rumors,” Rummenigge said. “He’s free to speak to whoever he wants from January 1.”",fcbayern,Karl-Heinz Rummenigge: Bayern Munich has done “everything” it could with David Alaba,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/ki9qc5/karlheinz_rummenigge_bayern_munich_has_done/,2020-12-23 01:25:29

whereeveritmaytakeme,1608487138.0,kgynxg,6.0,1.0,"This thought came to my mind after the game against Leverkusen. Generally, we have a great number of players which can (seemingly) placed anywhere on the field and still be trusted to do a solid job. 

For instance, Alaba: Was able to play left back, found an even better position as centreback and now - from time to time - plays midfield. Hernandez: Plays left or center back. Süle: Has still try to reach his form as center back, but did surprisingly well as right back. Musiala and Richards are seemingly allright against most of the Bundesliga on all positions.

This flexibility on one hand is necessary at the moment, with players like Goretzka, Nianzou still out. It allows Flick to rest players, which are in dire need of a break (which will become even more urgent with tournaments like this awful club world-championship). A good example for this is Pavard, who's performance are mediocre so far.

On the other hand, it also seems to allow Flick to disregard players which dont perform. Against Leverkusen, he chose again to let Süle play right back - instead of letting Sarr take another chance. How miserable must that be as a player if the coach chooses somebody playing on your position, which is not his standard. 

But it is not yet clear what that means for the likes of Sarr or Roca. Is Flick simply disregarding them or trying to motivate them to show more effort?

All in all, we are pretty to have this flexibility though. My wish would just be we have an adequate backup of Kimmich/Goretzka. Tolisso cannot control the game as they do. He does neither have the physicality of Goretzka, nor the intuition or the motivation of Kimmich. We'll see how Musiala or Roca might fit into this position this season though.",fcbayern,Is our flexibility also our bane?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kgynxg/is_our_flexibility_also_our_bane/,2020-12-21 01:58:58

Erdnussfreund,1608198909.0,keumui,10.0,1.0,"I get it why people are a little bit upset or angry or fearful about this formation what so ever. But I want to show a perspective on being in hansi flicks shoes. Every single player at bayern is so worldclass, that they are literally masters at what they do and hansi flick of course too. They try to make constant improvements for the long run. They push for innovation without pushing too hard for it. Now we've got the problem that we already won the triple, so whats there to push for? Another triple maybe, but the exact same playstyle cant do it. If we stop pushing for innovations and improvements we would get complecant. The 4-1-4-1 although it seems kinda deluded gets bayern out of their comfort zone and so they can keep their mastery. Its counter intuitiv but i think it can work and if the players figure the 4-1-4-1 formation out, then it will be a lot fun to watch this team play in this formation. It just needs time and patience.

Edit: please comment your opinions im very interested and hopefully a productive discussion can be made.",fcbayern,Hansi flicks 4-1-4-1 formation,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/keumui/hansi_flicks_4141_formation/,2020-12-17 17:55:09

We could have defended better when we conceded the goal, without question,**” said Flick. “**When the first ball becomes dangerous, our composure is not there. We played the safe pass or a long ball. I wasn’t too happy with that. We addressed that during the break. We wanted to play with more composure and occupy space better in the second half, to have men over. I was more satisfied with the second half. We can definitely play better. Our idea is to put the opponent under pressure. Today we weren’t able to implement it as we had planned. It will be a difficult season, we knew that in advance. Now we have to take the positives from the situation and improve on the things that didn’t go so well.” 

 “We didn’t look so good in one or two situations and gave away goal-scoring opportunities. But we could also have scored at the death and come away with a 2-1 win,**” said Neuer.** “You can concede a goal through a set piece. But I think there were too many counterattacks against us. We have to be careful for the next games. Union are a difficult team to play against. As a goalkeeper, it’s always annoying when you concede goals.” 

 “We’ve often gone a goal down recently. It happened very early today. Union fought hard and played man-to-man,**” Müller explained.** “We made life difficult for ourselves, especially in the first 20 minutes. We need momentum again and to bounce back again. We have the quality, mentally too, but of course it just happens that we not winning but rather drawing matches. It feels too little given our ambitions.”",fcbayern,"Hansi Flick, Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller react to Bayern Munich’s 1-1 draw at Union Berlin",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kcihw0/hansi_flick_manuel_neuer_thomas_muller_react_to/,2020-12-14 04:50:46

My bro is kind of a Bayern fan (good for him, man) and he loves the shit out of Lewa so I thought I would get him his kit for Christmas. I already have a present for him, just in case it arrives later, but it would certainly be cool if it got here before the 24th. Anyway, I thought I would be able to get it through Adidas but it seems they don’t allow customization on their website for some reason and unfortunately, Bayern’s official site doesn’t ship to Czech Republic where I currently reside. Do you guys know of any reliable online store that has fast shipping and Lewa’s official kit? Thank you.

[**Bayern Munich**](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/) defender Chris Richards is one of many impressive youngsters battling for time on the club’s roster.

Every time that Richards has taken the field, he has done his job in an exemplary fashion...and people are noticing, namely Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick.

In an interview with [**Sport1**](https://www.sport1.de/fussball/bundesliga/2020/12/fc-bayern-niklas-suele-neuer-abwehrboss-hansi-flick-legt-sich-nicht-fest?utm_source=sharing_platform&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharing_app), Flick offered some brief, but extremely supportive words on the Alabama native’s play so far this season. Flick noted that Richards “does his job very well” because he is “very calm and always present against his man.”

While that might not sound like a lot, it surely is coming from a man who piloted Bayern Munich to a treble last season — and also was an assistant coach on the 2014 [**World Cup**](https://www.sbnation.com/fifa-womens-world-cup)\-winning Germany side.

So far this season, Richards has appeared in seven games for Bayern Munich’s first-team and has an assist in 230 minutes. Richards has also made four appearances for Bayern Munich II in 3. Liga, where he has an assist in 360 minutes of game time.

With so much uncertainty regarding the futures of both David Alaba and Jerome Boateng in Bavaria, Richards could be aligning himself nicely for a more consistent and impactful role with the squad in the near future.",fcbayern,Chris Richards has impressed Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kblupo/chris_richards_has_impressed_bayern_munich/,2020-12-12 16:43:16

GingerKingGeorge,1607715728.0,kb9puj,3.0,1.0,"This idea hinges on a few ideas:

1) I think we can all agree that Phonzie-Lucas-Sule/Boateng-Pavard is the strongest version of our back line at this moment.

2) Pavard seems to have fitness and consistency issues, leading to our acquisition of Bouna Sarr.

3) Sarr is... Woeful. He doesn't track back, and when he does he's constantly getting spun or run around. When he does get forward, he offers very little offensively.

4) This leaves Alaba, who badly wants to get forward to the point that he frequently leaves us exposed when he plays centrally.

So hear me out... But what about trying Alaba as an inverted right back when Pavard isn't up to a full 90? He can get forward without leaving us so exposed, he can cross to the back corner, and is more or less perfectly positioned to take the crackshots we all know he is so fond of.

Is that really worse than Sarr? Really?

Josh_Harrows,1607604340.0,kaeny4,1.0,1.0,"I see a very large amount of criticism aimed at Sarr and many people saying he's not a good signing. I'd like to argue the opposite and say that as the season goes on he will become better and better and once our defensive gameplan is solidified, he will not only be a backup to Pavard, but will consistently rotate (though I rate Pavard more and believe he will start more games). Here are the reasons why.

His main shortcomings are either down to attitude or lack of familiarity with playing at our level:

-As can often be seen, he is slow to recognise the opportunity for an overlap, and therefore passes the ball back slowing down our attack. However this is something I believe will be corrected with time and with Flick and his team being particularly good at shaping players' playstyle. 

-He sometimes lacks that instinct that so many of our players do where he loses the ball and doesnt instantly track back or attempt to regain the ball. However as seen with Sané, whose defensive contribution and will to regain possession has been greatly increasing over the past games, this can also be coached.

His individual mistakes have been problematic but our defense as a whole has been mistake-prone and his errors have not been more glaring or frequent than they have been for Alaba, Boateng, Sule, or Pavard.

He is also very gifted physically and is a very different player to Pavard, which will let us shape up with a defensive or offensive minded right back depending on our opposition. He seems to show no negative emotions about being a backup and is happy to be there for the team.

I believe as he settles into the team and playstyle he will grow into a strong option for us and will be a strong asset in the future.",fcbayern,Bouna Sarr: an unpopular opinion,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kaeny4/bouna_sarr_an_unpopular_opinion/,2020-12-10 20:45:40

whereeveritmaytakeme,1607584348.0,kaau07,32.0,1.0,"Heya,

what is your opinion on our new backups - so far? I know, these guys are not having the ideal circumstances: No real pre-season tactictal training, starting in a team where all the rest knows each other and some of them had to get over injuries. But what is your opinion on those anyway? Namely, I am talking about Costa, Choupo, Sarr and Sané. I will leave out Nianzou, since he has just played some minutes so far. Roca as well, we have to see how he develops. He basically had one game.

**Costa:** Compared to the others, he had at least some chances to show his skills. So far, from my point of view, it is rather okay-ish. He is still quite fast and also agile, but appears hasty, blunders balls..I can see why Juve let him go on a loan. As backup, okay. But he is in no form to reach his form in best games at Bayern some years ago. Yesterday he seemed to be doing better..but on the wings, he's clearly number four in line.

**Sané:** He is an incredible player. He's great on the ball, he's very fast and he seems very motivated. But at the moment, he seems to be lacking a connection with the others. I am waiting for that moment so it ""clicks"" and he will fall into place like a matching puzzle piece. Though Gnabry is not at top level, Sané is at number three for the wingers. (from my point of view). He seems unsatisfied as well, yesterday there were several scenes where he got the ball close to the goal and it seemed like he just thought ""I have to score a goal!"" withouth caring about other players and despite the odds of scoring being against him.

**Choupo-Moting:** I think he is the one who has the most difficult position. He was barely allowed to play and when he did, he had semi-optimal support from the wings. Yet he scored yesterday which might improve his motivation and confidence. I think if he got more time, he'd also play better. It is nice to have him as a backup, but one hand Lewy seems to want to play every single game and on the other hand it is hard for CM to prove his merits with these rare chances.

**Sarr:** Though he already played at least more than a few minutes, he is absolutely mediocre for me. He tries hard, but I have the feeling he's not that energetic, powerful..Remember that time, when Lahm was our right back? And we had Rafinha as back-up? Back then, I would sometimes  bemoan not having a better backup - but really, Rafinha was most motivated, did what he could and pushed the team forward. With Sarr, it's like ""he's defending and sometimes plays some crosses/flanks, which are semi-successful."" He's 28, so it's not as if one would say ""yeah, he's still young and has to learn."" I am not convinced at all, if I compare what I´'ve seen at the best of Sarr with the best of Pavard, there are worlds between. For next season, I'd appreciate either using our youth material as backup or someone else.",fcbayern,Backup-review so far,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/kaau07/backupreview_so_far/,2020-12-10 15:12:28

SpartaNNNN4,1607541503.0,k9yhjz,38.0,1.0," 

Both [**Goal and SPOX**](https://www.goal.com/de/meldungen/transferhammer-fc-bayern-in-kontakt-mit-de-jong-berater/gmvbfu49p3j61amdap81usptx) are confirming that Bayern Munich does, indeed, at least have interest in FC Barcelona’s Frenkie De Jong — referring to the Dutchman as being “at the top” of Bayern’s wish list:

&gt;Information from Goal and SPOX coincide with the report of the Barcelona-based newspaper. De Jong, already at the top of the wish list of the Bayern squad planners around Hasan Salihamidzic during the Ajax times, is a person the German record champions are concerned with.

[**Goal**](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/barcelona-may-be-forced-into-de-jong-sale-as-bayern-get-ready-to-/x4ucyrt8dbv717ihbqwk1y53y) also issued another report on Bayern Munich’s alleged interest as well:

&gt;Should Barcelona be forced to sell, though, there is at least one team waiting to make a move as Goal and Spox can confirm Bayern Munich remain a big admirer of the Dutch midfielder.  
Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic remains a fan of De Jong, and has remained in contact with the midfielder’s agent in the time since the Dutchman’s decision. A potential move for De Jong would fill a need for Bayern, who have earmarked a midfield addition as a priority going forward.

Before he eventually signed with [**FC Barcelona**](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/), midfield phenom Frenkie De Jong underwent a long courtship process that included rumors that [**Bayern Munich**](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/) was heavily interested in the Netherlands international.

Could the Bavarians be looking to rekindle their pursuit?

According to Spanish outlet [**Mundo Deportivo**](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20201209/49992361663/barca.html), FC Barcelona is hoping to generate funds to fight its [**growing organizational debt**](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/soccer/barcelona/story/4201006/barcelona-announce-total-debt-has-doubled-to-488m-amid-coronavirus-pandemic%3fplatform=amp) and is considering a sale of De Jong — and Bayern Munich is among the prospective buyers. At 23-years-old, De Jong is considered one of the best, young midfielders in the world, but would surely be an expensive purchase for a club that already has Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka as lockdown starters:

&gt;Barça is aware that Bayern are in contact with Ali Durson, De Jong’s agent, to let him know that if there were the possibility of negotiating for the midfielder, they would be willing to talk.

The elephant in the room is the rumored €400 million exit clause that De Jong allegedly has in his contract. It is safe to assume that *if* Bayern Munich really is kicking the tires on De Jong, that would not be on their agenda:

&gt;Naturally, (Bayern would be) ignoring the €400 million clause. There would be a discussion about market prices that revolve around the same thing that Barcelona promised to pay Ajax when they bought them for €75 million plus €11 million in incentives.",fcbayern,Other sources corroborate report that Bayern Munich has interest in FC Barcelona’s Frenkie De Jong,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/k9yhjz/other_sources_corroborate_report_that_bayern/,2020-12-10 03:18:23

Flick: ""The team gained confidence and we had a good feeling. And during the preparation, everyone went along really well without any complaints, because everyone trusted the coaching team. Thiago told me back then: Coach, that was damn hard""

 Flick on motivation after winning everything: ""Lewis Hamilton is world champion every year, yet he wants to win every race. That's what makes champions. There is no satisfaction for us either.

*“Maybe they decided too early because every \[other\] trophy has been decided. So many players, coaches, journalists know that, for me, it was the best season.""*

*“We did what we did and it was spectacular. I'm glad everyone has seen it. These awards are something nice, amazing.*

*“But I also know that every personal trophy is for the team. The team without the striker finds it difficult to work but the striker without the team doesn't work either.”*

*For now, Lewandowski’s focus is locked on chasing down more collective silverware at Bayern, with Hansi Flick’s side determined to defend their* *Bundesliga**, DFB-Pokal and* *Champions League* *crowns.*

*With the German giants already through to the last-16 in Europe**, Lewandowski said: “We have won this trophy but it is clear once is not enough.*

*“We are still hungry. We want to taste this feeling with the fans, in a full stadium. Maybe after this season we will have a double celebration.”*

**Remaining competitive in 2020-21 will not be easy, though, with a short summer break, lack of supporters in grounds and a gruelling schedule making life difficult for all concerned.**

*Lewandowski added: “After \[last\] season when we \[finished\] and opened the new one, with such a short time to prepare, it is very hard —very hard for the body.*

*“Every player, every team. It's going to be impossible to compare this season to last year or next year.*

*“This is so hard. So many games, such a hard time and then the European Championship straight away. You have to think about your body and, in March, how it will be.* 

*“Will we be ready when the most important games are coming? You are a professional footballer and you have to adapt.”*",fcbayern,"Lewandowski: Maybe they decided too early because every [other] trophy has been decided.

Summary of Hansi Flick's press conference:

... on squad updates: ""Corentin Tolisso is out, he felt something on his muscles against Augsburg. We don't want to take any risks. Otherwise everyone is on board. After the final training tomorrow we will decide who to take with us.""

... on the tight schedule: “It is not our aim to use that as an excuse. We want to win all games at FC Bayern. You can see in all leagues that the teams have problems. It's not easy in this situation.""

... on the latest games: ""The first half in Augsburg was good, we should and could have led 4-0. The team is able to play the football we want again: pressing and forcing the opponent to make mistakes. In the second half we did not occupy the spaces as we have to occupy them.  That's why we didn't find our way into the game.  But I pull out positive things, that was the moral and the mentality. Now we can concentrate on Schalke.""

... on the newcomers: ""It wasn't easy for the new players, we didn't have a proper preparation. We have to bring the new players into this level tactically wise. Now, we have two weeks without midweek games in between to prepare.""

... on the comparisons Gerd Müller/Lewandowski: ""Gerd Müller was my role model. Unfortunately, I've never scored that many goals when I was in my youth. Gerd Müller is an absolute idol. It was a feast for the eyes to see him play. Robert scored more than him in the first half of the season, that speaks for his quality. But also for the fact that the team supports him again and again. A lot has to come together for it to continue like this. Robert knows that too. I would wish he could manage 40, but Gerd Müller is a brand."" 

... on Süle after the ACL injury: ""We'll see what the final training brings tomorrow. I'll wait until the end to get a review of the team. Niki has qualities and he has done better in the last few games when he was on the pitch. In this position he is one of the best. We want to bring him back to the good shape. He is on a very good path.""

... on Musiala's development: ""Jamal has enormous qualities, you could see that in Augsburg. He could go on 1v1 and is very self-confident. He has the quality to outsmart the opponent and create chances for the team. Bayern is clearly interested in keeping him for much longer."" 

... on Kouassi: ""At the moment he's running on the pitch. There is still one more step to be taken; we have to see how it develops. We have to wait. It's his second major injury, so we need to be careful about giving him the time. He's a great talent and has a great attitude. He already speaks German and you can talk to him. He is there every day and works absolutely professionally.""

... on Boateng's contract: ""Internally, we see how everything is developing and we think about every player. Jerome does a very good job and is an important player to rely on. He gives commands on the pitch. The development from the moment I came until now has been very positive. He was professional and last year he helped keep us stable at the back. He's a very important player for us right now. Of course we sit down, analyze and see what can happen in the future.""

... on Nübel: ""I can only say positive things about Alex. He is an absolute professional and a very fine person. It's good for the team. In training he shows enormous quality. We are well staffed for this positiin. Alex is always motivated and I'm happy with his development. I think he learned a lot too. Compliments to the way he is always there in training and performs.

Then there is Zirkzee, I loved him last season getting 4 goals and 1 assist last season in 9 games, which is very good for a backup to Lewy.
So I don’t get why we would buy Choupo-Moting, who has been mostly useless when he has played.

midnightverses,1611271795.0,l2anxl,132.0,1.0,"I think we can see the following major departures:-
1. David Alaba
2. Javi Martinez
3. Douglas Costa
4. Corentin Tolisso
5. Choupo-Moting
6. Jerome Boateng
7. Michael Cuisance

If the following players do leave I would like us to get the following players:-
1. Klostermann as back up to Davies
2. I don't think we need to replace Martinez as we have Roca.
3. If Douglas Costa leaves he should be replaced by CHO we have been linked with him for quite a long time and he would be a treat.
4. If Tolisso and Cuisance both leaves then buying a midfielder will be important imo and there are many candidates but I think we should try to snatch Florian Neuhaus. We need to keep a talent like him in the Bundesliga. Riqui Puig is also an amazing option.
5. I would like Choupo-Moting to be extended as Zirkzee future looks bleak and Arp has failed unfortunately. But if we don't extend, Adam Hlozek of Sparta Praha will be a great understudy and is currently the hottest prospect in Eastern Europe.
6. Upamecano with Hernandez would be great as Sule injury problems remain a problem.
7. If Cuisance leaves I don't think we need to sign anyone fortunately because of a certain Jamal MESSIala./s
I don't think we are mostly well provisioned with our first XI and only depth remains a minor issue. We only need to sign actively if most of the above mentioned players leave.
Do note I am not saying we need all these players. Heck out of the 7 players I mentioned some may not even leave.

Highly-talented and mercurial, Cuisance bolted to France  for a loan stint in hopes of being able to showcase his impressive  skills. While Olympique Marseille manager Andre Villas Boas reportedly  is happy with Cuisance, the player has not exactly lit up the scoresheet  in Ligue One. 

Cuisance has no goals and one assist in 18 games across  all competitions this season for Marseille and would seemingly be facing  an uphill battle to break into the Bayern Munich starting lineup any  time soon if he returned to Germany: 

 

&gt;With Michaël Cuisance (21), who was loaned to  Olympique Marseille, there is hope that the French pull the purchase  option, which would bring Munich 18 million euros. Coach André  Villas-Boas has made a strong case for a commitment.

Franck Ribéry advises Leroy Sané: “The moment players are on the field, they should give everything. For example, if Leroy has played an hour and has given everything, he can also go to the coach and say: ""Bring a new player for another 30 minutes."" That is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. I believe in Leroy because he is still young, has quality and talent.

Players like Kingsley or Gnabry have been with the club longer and therefore know the coach's philosophy better. Sané comes from Manchester City, a big club where he has already proven his quality in tough competition. But football is not easy, there are many factors involved. Sané knows that there is competition at Bayern too. Considering his time in Manchester, he won't have a problem with it. The four wingers at Bayern should support each other. Sitting on the bench shouldn't be a reason to lower your head- you can still make a difference in 20 minutes.” \[SportBild\]",fcbayern,"Franck Ribéry advises Leroy Sané ""The four wingers at Bayern should support each other.""",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/l15zsd/franck_ribéry_advises_leroy_sané_the_four_wingers/,2021-01-20 17:40:13

Upamecano

Bayern have recently asked the management of Dayot Upamecano to inform them in case another club such as Liverpool or Chelsea are thinking about activating the release clause of the player

Midfield transfer

Apart from the centre back position, Bayern's strategy for the other positions is transfers that are free or cost €10-15m and to count on the club's own talents

Omar Richards

Bayern are in talks with Omar Richards of Reading who will be a free agent in the summer. The idea is that the club needs another left-back alongside Alphonso Davies when Lucas Hernández returns to centre-back following Alaba's departure

Torben Rhein

Talented midfielder Torben Rhein (18) is considered at the club as the next Thiago. Rhein's current contract will be extended by one year

Tolisso

Bayern are not planning to extend Corentin Tolisso's contract which expires in 2022. The Frenchman is in the list of sales. The club wants to make some money by selling Tolisso before his contract expires

Cuisance

Bayern are hoping that Olympique Marseille would exercise their €18m option to buy for Mickael Cuisance in the summer. Marseille coach André Villas Boas has spoken in favour of buying Cuisance

Extra part written by another user in the replies, also citing SportBild:

If Bayern generates enough money trough sales tough etc. they would look to invest it in a midfielder like Zakaria or Neuhaus. Flick thought all last summer that he will get Hudson-Odoi, and his joy was limited when he knew he’ll get Douglas Costa in the last days instead.",fcbayern,SportBild report about our transfers next summer,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/l0zve7/sportbild_report_about_our_transfers_next_summer/,2021-01-20 10:43:40

Rummenigge: ""Hansi came in summer 2019 as an assistant coach, he then took over as a head coach overnight and within few months he rose to the elite of the world's best coaches, and deservedly so. In his contract, it is written that he is responsible for the training, tactics and the line-up. He is enough experienced to know what must be done. He has to handle things in such a way that we're there to win the silverwares once again.

The task is now to master what we did a year ago in 2021 and reach more successes. The best example in my whole years as an official at the club was the UCL tournament in Lisbon. We need this extraordinary spirit, this motivation and this willingness again now, if we want to achieve titles, and there are still a few more titles to be won this year. This is my appeal to the team."" \[TZ\]",fcbayern,Rummenigge On Hansi Flick Via TZ,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/l0kmqg/rummenigge_on_hansi_flick_via_tz/,2021-01-19 22:15:38

I personally want. 
- Let Costa go back, and then loan in Ivan Perisic again. (He was amazing at Bayern)
- (Maybe) Let tolisso go to make room for Florian Neuhaus. 
- With Alaba leaving, Sign Upamecano. 
- With Zirkzee having roumors of leaving and Motings loan ending in the summer. Signing or loaning a new backup striker.

Lothar Matthäus: “I have to criticise FC Bayern's buying policy a bit. With Philippe Coutinho, Thiago and Ivan Perisic, you lost three players. They were, of course, important players. They were always there and brought the necessary quality with them.""

.

Matthäus: ""With many new signings, it may take a certain amount of time to get going or the quality may simply not be there to say: 'They make the difference'. You knew from the start that it would be a long and difficult season with lots of games.""

.

Matthäus: ""I think that the depth of the squad in terms of quality is not set up in such a way that you can go through rotation and still maintain the quality."" 

.

Matthäus: ""There is a lack of concentration. Perhaps it is also because of the high levels of stress, because of the many games last year, and there was little break.""

.

Matthäus: ""You don't really have to change the system now, only the position of the system should perhaps be moved a little further back. So that there is not 30 or 35 metres of space between Neuer and the back four for the opponent to exploit, which is where they keep playing..”

We decided to not create a seperate thread but rather just allow posts.

Although we're talking about memes, there's still rules:

- Try to stay on topic (as in FC Bayern or atleast related to FC Bayern)

- No NSFW stuff

- Slight digs at rivals is okay (for example after a derby), but the main idea is to actually have memes about FC Bayern

- Atleast try to be a bit creative, none likes bad memes lol


If you have spectacular memes you're still allowed to post them after matches of course, but we're still gonna be as strict as before on those posts.

""I want to return to Bayern as a better player in the summer and fight for a regular place,"" he explained to **Goal** and  **Spox** .

""I believe in asserting myself at FC Bayern. This is my plan. But you can never make serious predictions in football. Who knows, maybe I'll stay in Nuremberg too.

""I haven't spoken to Hansi \[Flick\] since the summer, but I'm in close contact with the FC Bayern scouts. They follow my games very closely, give me feedback on my performance and show me where I can improve. This is very important to me.

""In the summer I exchanged ideas with Hansi about my situation and future almost every other day. He looks after the whole team, but especially the young players like me. I am very grateful to him for that... He advised me directly to take the chance (to change loan to Nuremberg, editor's note).

""Match practice is the most important thing at my age. And it is naturally not that easy to get from the professionals at FC Bayern.

""He approached me and asked where I come from and how I was doing. Müller was the greatest help with the integration, but everyone else also made sure that I felt welcome very quickly.

""During my first few weeks in Munich, I also spent a lot of time with my agent, a scout from FC Bayern and the English-speaking guys from the reserve like Chris Richards.""

After putting his boot to TSV 1860 Munich goalkeeper Marco Hiller’s face, Zirkzee was suspended for three games by the DFB.

The official release on [**FCBayern.com**](https://fcbayern.com/en/news/2021/01/three-match-ban-for-joshua-zirkzee) detailed the decision in this manner:

&gt;Joshua Zirkzee has been banned for three third division games after his red card in the Munich city derby between the FC Bayern Reserves and 1860 Munich (a 2-0 defeat). The German Football Association announced their decision on Monday. The 19-year-old Dutchman will also be banned from any other FC Bayern games during this time. Zirkzee was sent off in the 27th minute of the third division game last Saturday. The DFB judged the offence to be dangerous play.

The suspension comes at a tough time for Zirkzee as he is being heavily courted by Eintracht Frankfurt and FC Köln among others.

""When you ask me how to prevent that, on the one hand you have to keep the mistakes to a minimum, or avoid them, and on the other hand you have to cover your deep positions twice.

""We suffered similar situations on their first two goals. Hofmann went deep from midfield and we moved forward too quickly and opened the centre without covering the deep position, and with the second we should have kept going and covering the positions.""

""That shouldn't happen and it's not a nice situation to be in, but a defeat, even if it's Bayern Munich, is part of the game. In the second half the team tried everything to achieve a positive result but unfortunately it didn't work.""

Flick added: ""I've said it a few times, we are making too many mistakes. You can't deny that the team tried to win.

""We had to fight today, we knew it would be a difficult game. Don't forget \[Gladbach\] is a team that played in the [Champions League](https://www.goal.com/en/uefa-champions-league/4oogyu6o156iphvdvphwpck10) against top opposition and prevailed, so we needed this compact team performance and we showed – with the exception of these three situations.

**Bayern Munich** wanted to keep Perišić after the veteran winger helped the club secure a treble last season, but Inter Milan refused to lower its financial demands. This, of course, was extremely odd because there was virtually no chance that Conte was all of a sudden going to “like” Perišić and find a way to use him effectively after previously failing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Foot Mercato claim Jose Mourinho holds ‘great interest’ in Perišić and that discussions between both clubs are already underway. Perisic, whose contract is set to run down in June 2022, is not typically a first-choice name on Antonio Conte’s team sheet at the San Siro. Just 11 of his 21 showings so far have come from the start, and his return of two goals and a couple of assists have seen him endure a frustrating last few months. The same publication believes that Perisic has still drawn admiring glances from several clubs, however, with Tottenham said to be among his potential suitors.

 

Two things are clear:

1. Inter Milan’s hardball act predictably came back to bite them. Why wouldn’t they have backed off their alleged €20 million figure for Perišić when they knew he was oil to Conte’s water? This is a major failure with regard to squad planning and roster vision.
2. Perišić is readily available as we knew he would be.

So, given the injury history of Leroy Sané, Kingsley Coman, and Serge Gnabry...and when factoring in Gnabry’s slump and Douglas Costa’s ineffective play....would you explore bringing back Perišić?",fcbayern,Bayern Munich treble-winner Ivan Perišić available for loan,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/ktntks/bayern_munich_treblewinner_ivan_perišić_available/,2021-01-09 17:25:08

I'm a Canadian football fan and haven't really had the chance to watch FC Bayern play too often this year. So, I was curious, how has Phonzie performed so far this year?

I know he was hurt to start the season, and he's slowly getting back to full fitness and getting quality match time. Despite all that, how has he done? Is he showing progress at the LB position?

Do you think LB is where his future will be or will he eventually be moved up to winger?

SpartaNNNN4,1610043775.0,ksj6nj,1.0,1.0,"Guess what footballing greats Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller have in common? They all have enormous goal contributions and have achieved exceptional sporting success. And one of the key reasons behind it: impeccable fitness.

In an interview with German outlet kicker, *Die Roten*’s Chief Scientific Officer and head of fitness Professor Dr. Holger Broich threw light on *Mullewandowski*’s impressive fitness record.

The two forwards play in a position that requires strenuous activities throughout the course of the game. They frequently engage in aerial duels, are bound to get fouled roughly and thus, are vulnerable to muscle injuries.

But where others have failed to keep up with the hefty physical demands, Lewandowski and Müller seem to remain unaffected, even in the most grueling of schedules like this season’s.

***“There’s not just one reason,” Broich said, before explaining that “performance in metabolic and neuromuscular areas play an important role. The higher the fitness level in these areas, the lower the risk of injury.”***

***“The number of relevant factors in the context of injury is very large. It’s so large, and the relationships between factors are often still so unknown, that they are beyond the grasp of our normal brain,” said Broich, who was recently awarded as “Fitness trainer of the year” by the Rome-based Strength and Conditioning Society, told kicker.***

***“This is where modern methods such as artificial intelligence come into play. We have gained experience with these methods ourselves,” said the fitness expert, before adding that modern tech remains an interesting topic of conversation at Bayern.***

***“Also, the history of the players is important,” Broich added. “The higher the number of previous injuries, the greater the risk of new incidents. However, genetic influences also seem to play a role, for example the muscle fiber spectrum.”***

SpartaNNNN4,1609650688.0,kpebb3,1.0,1.0," “There’s hardly been any breathers since March, but there are no breathers for anyone in society at the moment,” Salihamidžić said. “The workload for players and coaches, physios and doctors, is already huge. But we have to think differently about a lot of things right now and be grateful that we can play our sport. A few quiet days with family will be enough this time.”

COVID-19 has not just been hard on the players, coaches, doctors, and physios, though. The front office has been tasked with evolving to stay ahead of the curve during a very uncertain time for finances and scouting.

“In terms of structure, we’re planning quite normally. We scout, we analyze, we discuss positions and players. Regardless of coronavirus, we as FC Bayern have to be early with our ideas and think very creatively,” said Salihamidžić. 

 “Youth work is very important for FC Bayern – that has nothing to do with coronavirus. If a young player has the talent to play for the first team, he has it, regardless of coronavirus or not,” Salihamidžić remarked. “We see the development with joy and confidence, with Jamal Musiala, with Chris Richards, with Bright (Arrey-Mbi), but also with Angelo Stiller. And then we’ve got Alphonso Davies, who’s still young, and also Tanguy Nianzou, who’s only 18. Something is growing there and we have to do everything at all levels to ensure that as many of those named as possible make it to the first team.”

The prospect of Thomas Muller possibly returning to the German national team is a topic of discussion that just won’t seem to go away. The *Raumdeuter* has been one of [**Bayern Munich**](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/)’s most influential players both this season and last season, leaving fans and pundits alike pining for his return to Joachim Low’s *Die Mannschaft* setup.

When recently speaking to Bild, Oliver Kahn offered his praises for Muller and echoed the popular idea that he should 100% be reinstated to Low’s setup for the German National team ([**Sport Bild**](https://sportbild.bild.de/fussball/nationalmannschaft/nationalmannschaft/oliver-kahn-ueber-mueller-thomas-koennte-jederzeit-in-der-nationalelf-spielen-74701168.sport.html)).

“In terms of quality, Thomas could play in the national team at any time. Jogi Löw wants to reassess this in the spring. Thomas is a phenomenon ” Kahn said. “Jogi Löw made decisions that were painful for Bayern players.”",fcbayern,"Oliver Kahn says Thomas Muller is a “phenomenon,” backs a return to the German national team",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/koqwka/oliver_kahn_says_thomas_muller_is_a_phenomenon/,2021-01-02 12:38:40

Coman admitted that he is very poor at heading as he rarely manages to see the ball until the last moment. When it mattered, Coman was able to score at the biggest stage in European football.

&gt;***“I’m scared when I get headers and I always close my eyes. My team-mates joke about it.”***  
***“The day before the game we practiced finishing, and I didn’t convert a single header.”***

 Coman will go down as a hero in Bayern’s history for scoring such an important goal. This goal also turned out to be pivotal for the French winger’s career. He has been an inconsistent and frustrating wide player that can do the right things until the final third. His decision-making often let him and the team down.",fcbayern,Bayern Munich: Kingsley Coman reveals story behind goal against PSG,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/ko7pja/bayern_munich_kingsley_coman_reveals_story_behind/,2021-01-01 16:03:59

Your dream final?
Flick: ""Unlike the World Cup, there's a draw for every round in the Champions League. So it's difficult to think far. In quarters and semis, there are often games that deserve to be a final, like Bayern Barcelona last year. I don't have a particular wish. We've to enjoy every tie.""

Flick had publicly called for transfers, which Salihamidžić didn't like and was surprised by the ""public squad planning"" [@SkySportNewsHD] 

&gt;The Alexander Nübel case sparked off fire. Flick would have preferred Sven Ulreich to stay. Flick also wanted signings like Dest and Hudson-Odoi, instead of Sarr &amp; Costa. Even Sané wasn't Flick's desired player. He was more interested in Werner or Havertz [@SkySportNewsHD]

&gt;Due to these decisions, Flick even demanded a veto right on transfers from the Bayern bosses. However, Bayern ""didn't like that because the club is above all"" [@SkySportNewsHD]

&gt;Now with the Germany job available, Flick has an exit door, and a departure is not categorically ruled out.

Der Kläger – ein Grafiker – hatte riesige Karikaturen der beiden  ehemaligen Bayern-Stars Franck Ribéry und Arjen Robben als Varianten von  Batman und Robin entworfen. Die übermenschlich großen Aufsteller der  beiden Stars wurden beim DFB-Pokal-Halbfinale zwischen München und  Borussia Dortmund im April 2015 in der Münchner Allianz Arena gezeigt.  Der Slogan darunter: *„The Real Badman &amp; Robben“.*

Die Karikatur und der Slogan kamen bei den Fans so gut an, dass der  FC Bayern den Spruch mit neu gezeichneten Motiven auf  Merchandising-Artikel druckte. Das gefiel dem ursprünglichen  Krikaturisten überhaupt nicht. Er verklagte den Fußballclub vor dem  Landgericht München I und berief sich auf sein Urheberrecht.

MeditatePeacefully,1619620062.0,n0g0v8,3.0,1.0,"Curious to hear your thoughts how the team will change under Nagelsmann

I don't have very strong opinions/preferences for the existing squad - obviously the current core (Lewa/Mueller/Gnabry/Kimmich/Goretzka/Hernandez/Davies/a few others...) should definitely stay in place. I also think Sane should start to shine a bit more next year. Similarly a few others like Pavard will hpoefully get out of their slump

Sarr and even Roca are not likely going to work out the way I see it right now. I like Roca but w Musiala staying w us, it's likely that Musiala will get preference (already bc he decided to play for the DFB and Bayern = DFB to some extent...)

However, I would love to see us making a move for another big name up front - I know Mbappe is obviously out of question w his intention to move to Real, but Haaland would be great. Combine Lewa/Haaland up front 👻 Werner could be another option but after his year at Chelsea, I'm a bit less excited about him. Also, we need a typical 9 once Lewa retires at around 40 😅

His style of football is complex yet very beautiful and dominating when implemented. People can make their jests and jokes about him being a checkbook manager but no one quite understands how detrimental he is towards success till you actually have him as your manager. 

For you bayern fans, it has always intrigued me, he had such a great squad with the likes of robbery, lewa, lahm, rise of kimmich, yet he couldn’t bring you the champions league. So my question is, how does he fair in respect of previous and current Bayern Munich managers and what went wrong with pep in your opinion, do Bayern fans rate Pep as highly as we city fans or Barcelona fans do?",fcbayern,Pep Guardiola,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/myuen7/pep_guardiola/,2021-04-26 18:15:06

SpartaNNNN4,1618773006.0,mtj8kb,8.0,1.0,"***I came across these two posts on my social media - a bit interesting but take it with a grain of salt.*** 

If we sacked Brazzo, we would pay to him 3m€ whole package as compensation.

If we let Flick go and buy Nagelsmann, we would have to spend 20m€ on his fee alone, almost nearing our transfer budget.

If Flick's contract is terminated, DFB would get him on a free and that's their aim because they can't and don't want to pay the 7m€-8m€ for Flick. 

Although the public announcement by him yesterday was unprofessional, he is playing the cards really well.  
The message he is indirectly delivering is quite clear: ""Either lose me free, or sack Brazzo.""

He has leverage, and very good arguments to stand up for himself.

Bayern has to choose. 📷

The last few weeks has just been horrible and terrible. We went from a champions league favourite to a team in transition in the span of 2-3 weeks.

1. Controversies
2. Management fights that finally boiled over.
3. Coach leaving.
4. Squad in need of desperate buying.
5. Fans torn between flick and the club management.
6. Injuries left and right. (is lucas still alive?)

And all of this came off just because we lost one damn match. But, it feels like we are facing a major overhaul like barca after they 8-2 much goals. (sorry, I had to.)

WildKidz,1618752925.0,mtcxmn,15.0,1.0,"I can understand everyone being mad at him and feeling like he’s the reason we are losing Hansi. We, as a fan base, have a lot to owe to both of them, and I honestly think Brazzo is more critical to the club than Hansi. Brazzo has built this team. Does anyone else remember this summer when the whole world was amazed at just how good Bayern is at getting players they want and getting them cheap that starts with Brazzo. Bayern can exist with 1000 different coaches; what is most important to this club from top to bottom is culture. Without the Bayern culture, we don’t even get to a place of winning the treble. Hansi has one of the best squads in the world and plays favorites with them for him to then go and complain he’s not getting what he wants when he chooses to play the old men of Alaba and Boa at center back keeps Roca from even sniffing the team. He uses Javi as our utility player; it’s all a bit absurd; we haven’t lost a Bundesliga game that Lucas has played in, yet he, for whatever reason, refuses to mend his team to make room for one of the most in-form defenders in the world. This, coupled with his tactically narrow mindset (we have the best gk in the world, and he didn’t have a clean sheet for 10 league games in a row) of just saying my way or the highway, I’m kind of glad that he’s leaving. I also believe truly Nagelsmann is one of the top 10 managers in the world, and he’s a fan of this club. It’s most likely his dream to manage us. He, I think, is the type of manager we could have for 4 or 5, maybe even 10 years, and I would be thrilled with it. Anyways that’s just my rambling. I understand the sadness, but Bayern is more than just one coach and one executive. We will get through this and hopefully have one of our own at the helm.

Nagelsmann (highly possible according to Matthaus and also highly wanted among fans, but heard he's kinda crazy in tactics.  Also I doubt whether Leipzig would let him leave )

Ten Hag (I saw one [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/mszbgz/ten_hag_instead_of_nagelsmann/) here, but I'm not quite familiar with him, guess you can to that post)

Low (I do not quite believe him given the performances at DFB, it would be stupid and ridiculous if the situation next season is like Low and Flick changing their position)

Klopp (Do you guys really think Liverpool would let him leave?  His contract with Liverpool expires in the summer of 2022)

Matthaus ( he's the kind that good at playing but not quite at coaching)

Klose/Demichelis (they are now doing FCB II/academy, have the so-called Bayern DNA so familiar with the style we are playing, but I highly doubt if they have the ability to coach the squad giving their poor experience in coaching

A coach that played attractive football that met every opponent with fear. But also a coach that allowed an egozentric Hasan Salihamidzic dictate to him what players he needed or not. Last year we had a bench that had people like Coman and Perisic on it. Then important players were let go because Hasan disagreed with Flick (Thiago, that one still hurts). 

So now this popular coach is leaving because he has had enough of the constant tension with HS, and no one from upper management is standing up for him. I unfortunately foresee a few years of mediocrity ahead as Bayern will be looking for the right coach, let a couple or three of them go because while they dominate or partake in the Bundesliga title, they won't go far in the Champions League. And they won't have the right player because someone inexperienced and self-centered like HS is still at the helm.

Sane 25, Gnabry 25, Coman 24, Musiala 18, Goretzka 26, Davies 20, Hernandez 25, Sule 25, Kimmich 26. Hell of a young core. 

Yes, Lew, Muller and Neuer are older, and Bayern lost some depth with departures of Alaba and Boateng. But have Upamecano coming in and Lewandowski and Neuer have at least two more elite years. Sucks Flick is probably gone (but the first PSG leg was bad managing, just saying. Yes, spoiled after a treble).

butterchicken_boi,1617753282.0,mlpc64,2.0,1.0,"It’s odd how one can find remarkable solutions to the greatest of problems in places were you least expect to find them. Robert Lewandowski, Polish Marksman, Bane of Yellow/Black teams, annihilator of CB’s across Europe is just about irreplaceable. Just about...

Now some folks thought that Serge “the Chef” Gnabry could replace him. Clearly fate, and the damn pandemic, thought otherwise. And while Eric Maxim ChoupoGOATing is certainly competent, even he would struggle to escape the man-marking of MARQ-inous. But there is one man, one LEGEND, who technically speaking, is far superior to Robert, Ronaldo, Messi, Ronaldo Nazario, Maradona, Cruyff, Gerd “OG” Müller and even Pele himself. 

Have you guessed it yet?

You see, I, like millions of students worldwide was procrastinating by aimlessly scrolling through the quagmire that is Instagram. But I stumbled on a somewhat innocuous post that will prove, as you continue to read, anything but. It was a post by our beloved club, Bayern’s official account, of my dear Phonzie.

The video showed Davies receiving a brilliant pass while airborne, seemingly willing his body to levitate a few meters above the ground, and creating a caricature of the Bundesliga logo as he sought to delicately control the ball; all very good practice prior to the PSG game, I’m sure.

But, as Instagram replayed the video, I noticed someone. And that someone, ladies and gentlemen, is our saving grace. Indeed, while Phonzie is a true budding star, his young star pales in comparison to the yellow giant in the video: the person who delivered the pass to him!

And what a pass it was! Brilliantly, indeed beautifully, it curled through the air, just high and enough to allow Alphonso to reach it, but with the sort of “curl” that I (regrettably) struggle to achieve IRL.

That man is our saviour. A man born to be the epitome of a true striker, one who roamed the pitch in Europe and abroad, for the better part of a decade reigning havoc on opposing defences. Everywhere from Germany, Italy, Brazil, South Africa he earned the adoration and accolades of the world. He, while retired, is now serving brilliantly as one of our assistant coaches.

He is Miroslav Klose.

Hansi Flick, bring Kloseure to the problem of our missing sticker and play Miro. There are no downsides; he is fit enough to play ~ 60 minutes, has been actively training and is literally one of the greatest strikers ever. In Miro we trust.

Manny or Iker. I know this debate is basically pointless since Iker is in no way a competitor to Neuer. I believe (and other football fans and friends) even Kahn was a gazillion times better than him. The problem is he thinks sportbible and other clickbait agencies are a reliable source for proving such an argument. I mean, are u serious? U can’t be serious tho? It really hurts my brain when people say stuff without having any perspective. 

What do you guys think? Does Iker reach Neuer’s knees or is Manny in a league of his own (GOATkeeper)? 

I’d appreciate if you have some solid arguments (trophy and stats comparison) in any of the sides.",fcbayern,A stupid debate.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/ngu9j9/a_stupid_debate/,2021-05-20 16:02:24

RaduLum,1621321950.0,nf3zfn,27.0,1.0,"I was talking to some fellow r/chelseafc users and the topic of Kane vs. Lewa came up. Kane is an amazing player, and is currently leading the PL while playing for Spurs, as another user pointed out, which is a very difficult feat. Am I crazy for thinking that Lewa is even better than that?

For me, he’s been the best and most complete striker for a few years now and I feel like people still don’t recognise that. He’s won countless trophies, he’s been integral to the team for so many years, and he should have had a Ballon d’Or to his name. Perhaps the last factor plays a big part is why people don’t recognise him, and it’s a shame if that’s the case because just watching him play tells you need to know.

Another user even went so far as to say that Benzema and Suarez are more complete strikers, and have more to their game including dribbling and passing. Again, two fantastic players but neither of them are at Lewa’s level right now. We shut down those “more complete” strikers for the better part of four games, I doubt we could achieve that against Lewa.

A_Dying_Llama,1620998991.0,nc8n61,9.0,1.0,"Buffon has made it clear he will not be extending his Juventus contract, stating he isn't sure whether he is looking for a new challenge or to retire. 

How does this relate to FC Bayern? 

Well, it's been made clear that Nuebel is dissatisfied with his playing time, and that Neuer is the clear first-choice: for every competition. 

With rumors of Nuebel's loan to a club such as Monaco or Lille, his departure leaves a gap at backup keeper. 

To fill this gap? Buffon. He can be signed on a single-season deal, will barely be played, will be reliable when he does see the field, and will be gone by the time Nuebel returns from a potential loan. 

Finally, Bayern are probably the club that give him the greatest chance of winning his UCL trophy.",fcbayern,Opinion: FC Bayern should sign Gianluigi Buffon for the 21/22 season.,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/nc8n61/opinion_fc_bayern_should_sign_gianluigi_buffon/,2021-05-14 21:29:51

As a Child I knew signs... There was the cross sign, there was  superman , batman, and Spiderman signs I knew growing up and then there was Bayern Munich's sign. Once I found football all I could watch is English premiere and the nationals where I found love for Germany team and rooted for them. Now as I stand here Today I wonder to myself should this be my team. 

What scares me is the lost of managers and more importantly why they keep leaving. Then BM age of top two players. Robert and Muller are the best duo I have ever seen. And now there is whispers about Robert leaving? 

With 9 🏆in row I'm sure the team isn't short of supporters but I think about becoming a member and following the team a lot.

knightedwolf,1626302984.0,okfq1o,31.0,1.0,"First off, let me say that I’m looking at these options only because it seems lewy wants to leave (based on rumors).  If he does, we need a replacement, and here are three that good options in my opinion:


1.	Erling Haaland:  If he doesn’t leave BVB this year, apparently his agent will help Bayern snag him.  If we can afford the price, obviously he’s likely to be a lethal striker for us.  However, looking at Bayern’s history of high profile transfers, this seems like a long shot.  

2.	Paulo Dybala:  Looks like his career at Juve is unsettled and he’d be a great striker with his dynamic plays.  It would be interesting to see if he’d fit well into our style of play and a like for like replacement for Lewandowski, but nevertheless, a good option. 

3.	Antoine Griezmann:  With the latest reports, he’s apparently going back to Atleti on a swap deal and leaving Barca.  His time at Barca has been below avg for sure, but I think that’s more so because of their overall setup and the issues at the club and less so because of anything he himself did.  For example, he had a pretty good Euro 2020 for France, and always plays well for France.  France’s playing style is a bit similar to ours, and well, we do have a ton of French players.  He’s a new option that popped up, and something Kahn and Hasan might look at. 

————————

Of course, if Lewandowski stays at Bayern and continues to play at this level for a few more years it would be ideal.  But I’m sure the club is already thinking of a longer term replacement considering he’s turning 33 next month.  

These are only a few options I’ve listed, some others could be Mbappe, Patrik Schick, Harry Kane (unlikely to move to Germany tho), Timo Werner, Ciro Immobile, Romelu Lukaku, Silva Andre.",fcbayern,Potential Lewandowski replacements,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/okfq1o/potential_lewandowski_replacements/,2021-07-15 06:49:44

You guys can find many more news on internet about this. [This website](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE22/010/2013/en/) has a report published by international human rights body about the labour exploitation in the country during the construction of worldcup stadiums. I had been following the news for a while   and had hopes that some steps would be  taken to punish qatar for the treatment of migrant workers during the building of stadiums in qatar but it's as usual. They don't care about the common folks. I would not have problem with corruption and  qatar holding worldcup but the way the migrant workers were treated that led to death of many  makes me sad and angry. What makes me more sad and angry is that US and it's allies are keeping quiet when most of the times they are moral policing others all over the world. But it's not unusual.  Times and again we have seen that rich and powerful, politicians don't care about the common folks.

So i do think that it's time for us common folks to step up again and do our best so that we can show them we can make a difference. Now with internet and social media we do not need to go to roads or go from houses to house to spread awareness and protest. We can make post, videos, articles, etc.  and share it with people we know and others. I hope that we can punish qatar as much as we can. It could be a lesson for countries like qatar to change their way. They might buy countries officials, organisations but there will still be common people who are watching.

The best we can hope is worldcup 2022 won't be held in qatar, the least we can do is not watch worldcup and totally ignore it. I am here just to make a small difference and hope other's will do the same. It's time we create posts, videos and articles like this and share. It will be little bit bad for football fans if it gets canceled but i do hope it takes place in another place so all of us can enjoy the sweet victory we got after the worldcup won't be held in qatar.

The current banner has a size of 1679 (width) and 175 (height), so the new banner should obviously have a similar size aswell

The quality of the picture should atleast be HD

Faivre has been attracting interest from Bayern Munich as of late, and I think he could be a great bargain for the Bavarians at around €15m. Not only a set piece specialist and a brilliant dribbler, he breaks lines so effortlessly and has been praised by Thierry Henry himself.   
I've made an analysis on the Frenchman and included the link down below. Tell me what you think of him, would he be a good buy?

**On tomorrow's game:** ""For them, this is a once-in-a-lifetime game. They will try to play a physical game. In the end, the fact is that we have to and want to win, which means that we need to remain focused on the task at hand.""

**On Sané:** ""I said enough about the whistles. it's normal that you'll be judged when your job is public. But it's about the way you do it. The way he's been treated was not good. I told him my opinion after the game. I'm not going to hug him for five hours, now it's about work""

\*\*On Kimmich's extension: ""\*\*It's nice that he did it alone. But it is also possible to have the reins in your own hands even with an agent.  It's a bit more difficult when you change clubs, but that wasn't the case here. Nonetheless, he's an incredibly smart man.""

**On Bouna Sarr:** ""At the start of the preparation he had problems adapting, now he's making progress and doing better. He has to keep going and do the things I want. He has to be more stable in defense and reduce the risk of conceding goals to the minimum""

""Mickaël Cuisance will be in the squad tomorrow. But I'm not going to reveal who is going to play. I don't want to make it that easy for my opponent or for you journalists.""

**On the fan climate and critics:** ""I don't want to reduce it to football, but everyone would do well to treat each other sensibly in this world. The stadium is a good reflection of society and not an isolated place. Be nice to each other!""

I'm not really a fan of Süle and I'm doubting if he'll even be in the starting xi when Lucas recoveres. So right now I'm trying to decide between Müller or just blank (with the advantage of being able to return it and being able to order it from a third party website for faster delivery).

Manuel Neuer (35) could not participate in the training of FC Bayern on Thursday. The goalkeeper is injured.

Manuel Neuer was one of the reasons why Julian Nagelsmann appeared confident at the beginning of the week when it came to how FC Bayern could stop Erling Haaland in the Supercup. The ""best goalkeeper in the world"" actually did not have to concede a goal from the Norwegian, but that was also because Dayot Upamecano and Niklas Süle were in good form in Dortmund. 

In that Supercup, however, Neuer had also injured himself in a press hit by Haaland after about an hour and still played on.

As Bayern announced on Thursday, the 35-year-old could not take part in training because of a ""capsule injury to the right ankle"".

Whether and how long Neuer is out, the record champion did not announce. Sven Ulreich would be available as a backup.

This might hurt the smaller club but that is just how the world works. Nobody complains about how second division teams are able to financially function, we just accept that's how things are.

I know that Lahm and Mueller have previously invested in startups. Also, various others like Neuer or Davies are doing things (eg fitness / NFTs). Boateng / Alaba also have done bunch of stuff though from what I've previously it's more around building their own brand / clothing, so probably less relevant for what we do

dabayer,1628543546.0,p1an0w,8.0,1.0,"As some of you might know there is a r/fcbayern fantasy league. Last year there where 30 participants. This season we are aiming for more! Some people seemed reluctant due to the time investment and their supposed limited knowledge of the Bundesliga, so I decided to make a short guide. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How does the fantasy league work?

* Your team must consist of 15 players. 2 Goalkeepers, 5 Defenders, 5 Midfielders, 3 Forwards.
* You start with a 150 million budget to build your 15-player fantasy team.
*  From your 15 player squad, select 11 players to form your starting line-up.
* You can modify your squad throughout the season in the transfer market. 
* Every week you have 3 transfers, with NT game weeks offering unlimited transfers.
* The transfer market is opened during the rest days of the Bundesliga.
* You can chose 3 star players (captains), one from each outfield position, who is getting double points.

 So what are the 4 bench players for?

 As a manager you can substitute players at any time. If you remove a player that has already played during a matchday you will lose his points and you will not be able to put him on the field during that match day. 

But I dont have time to make transfers every week and pay attention to details!

That doesnt only go for you but many others. Barely anybody is investing an hour or two each week to perfect their squad. You can pick a team and change it every now and then and still do well. 

&gt;But I dont know anything about teams aside from Bayern and Dortmund.

Its impossible to create a team out of elite players only as they are too expensive, so you will have to buy cheaper players from mid table teams like everybody else. But nobody knows for sure which mid table team and player will bring you the most points. Try to google websites that suggest good value players, or just skim through whoscored or Kicker and find players from Freiburg or Hoffenheim that generally had a good rating last season. Usually after a few match days you can sort by points/value and find the gems.

&gt;What are some super secret tips? How can I win the league?

Try not to buy 11 starters and 4 unusable backups, but 15 players that might make you points. To make good use of your subs and the possiblity to swap the captains avoid to have all players in a position playing on the same time. Try to find players that play are more advanced role than what the Bundesliga fantasy league is placing them. Angelino for example is of course a defender, but he also plays as a winger and has a lot of goal contributions. Assists and goals give more points on defenders. If you want to go all out, study what gives players points and chose your players accordingly, like picking a teams' freekick or corner taker for extra assists. There is still more, but even I dont go full nerd and therefore mostly go by my gut feeling.

julesvr5,1628268200.0,ozafq6,15.0,1.0,"&gt;""It depends on the character, of course. Some see learning German as a duty, others want to do it and see the sense behind it. Omar Richards, for example, has been here every day since he joined us. I even have to stop him and say, ""Jo, I'd like to have Sundays off,"" I think he'd like to be here on Sundays, too (laughs). 

&gt;Tanguy learned German very quickly, King did too, and so did Xabi Alonso. But I was really surprised by two youth players. Taylor Booth and Chris Richards. At the beginning I thought it would be a bit harder for them, because it's always more difficult for Americans because they're used to getting through everywhere with their language. But the two of them really got into it and after a year they were at a really good level. With Chris Richards, meanwhile, you can talk about anything after two years.""

&gt;What was the best excuse a player gave when they didn't do their homework? 
""One guy told me without joking that his dog ate his homework. I told him that I had already used that excuse in 1984. So with me, no one has to come up with excuses, I know them all."" 

&gt; ""Back when I started here, I was still a bit reserved. Big football star and all, it was a different environment than at university where I taught. Now I really don't care and I openly say 'hey, honestly, are you serious, that's 10 minutes of work'. And there are also internal punishments from the club if someone doesn't do it. Because it's simply important for the club. Not only for the external image of the club, but also because we have noticed how important it is for the players.  So they don't feel lost, they don't feel isolated.""

&gt;""It varies from coach to coach. With Julian, there's a lot of tactics involved, and it's also important to him that the players understand that. With Hansi it was less tactics but that you can talk on a human level. With Niko, I was less involved, but with Hansi and Julian, I was very involved. I prefer it that way because then I can adapt my lessons better. Then they don't have to learn what refrigerator means, but what redouble means, because I know the trainer needs this term.""

&gt;""We did a play some time ago. All the boys who study with me performed for the team. It was a little evening event. We rehearsed for it every day. The boys were always on time, everything went really well. Of course they played it cool, but I know them, they were really nervous. But they did it super well. Of course, acting suits one more than the other. Lucas really came up trumps. The boys were proud. I thought it was nice that players like Serge, Joshua and Manu went up to the boys and said 'great job Luci, great job Phonzie' - the boys were proud.""

&gt;If you couldn't do your German lessons, which of your students would you put the pen in the hand and say 'you're doing the lesson today'?
""Tanguy Nianzou. Or even Marc Roca."" 

&gt;If you had to send one of your students to the podcast to speak German for a lesson, who would it be? 
""Lucas Hernandez. There's a lot of gibberish. He has days where he does super well, and some days you think 'since when are you there, since when are you learning German'. But, and this is the most important thing, Luci always talks. He has confidence and just talks.""
