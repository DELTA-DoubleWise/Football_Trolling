With enough money to buy a whole new teams, the two managed to bring home a tremendous amount of flops and left us deep in debt with a bunch of unsellable junk. The general opinion is that 2017 was the starting point of a new collapse that we gradually built upon since, starting from the next, ultra-hyped up mercato, led by former club legend Leonardo. However, I disagree, and I'm here to prove a point: that we greatly overrate the quality of Leonardo's work at the club, whereas his now dead legacy proves that the 2018 mercato was not only mediocre, it was an outright disaster, arguably worse than the previous one.",ACMilan,"With the departure of Paquetà, I think we can officially say: Leonardo disasterclass was worst than Fassobelli [Effort Post]",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/j1yorv/with_the_departure_of_paquetà_i_think_we_can/,2020-09-29 20:57:31

sonictank,1601381691.0,j1y1y3,13.0,1.0,"Jesus we sucked with these. We barely recovered from Fassobeli fuck ups, and while I though Leonardo will turn things around it seemed like he's just a guy who knows how to spend rich.

I'll go from the worst to the least bad signings:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Andre Silva (38m)** \- a flop. Never really shined in our jersey, I have never seen the massive talent they talk about. Managed to collect 25 appearances in Serie A (mostly by being subbed-in) and scored only 2 goals (one was that legendary header in Genoa I think, in 97th minute). Managed to be kicked out of the squad by a primavera kid. Overall, really bad experience in Milan for both parties, though I'm glad he's finding himself in Eintracht.
* **Leonardo Bonucci (42m)** turned into **Mattia Caldara** \- both flops. Captain Leo's story is probably one of the weirdest in modern football history. Guy gets angry at his coach and demands a transfer to the rival club, but then demands a transfer back after one year. It's like a Monty Pythong sketch. I think Bonucci in the last couple of years is far from what he used to be - one of the most prominent centre backs in Europe. His season with us was shaky, started really bad but kind of picked it up in the second part. Still, the whole adventure somehow didn't seem right. We switched him back for Caldara, had a champagne party how we fucked over Juve for him, only to get an injury prone and unlucky player that barely collected 2 (again that's TWO) appearances for our club. FFS.
* **Fat Gonzalo** (I believe the agreed fee was something about **52m**) turned into **Krzysztof Piatek** \- a flop and a one-season-wonder. Actually, Gonzalo was kind of ok in Milan up until he fucked up that game against Juventus, after that he was never there mentally. But overall his performance really dropped in recent years, in Chelsea and Juventus as well (they barely got rid of him), so the silver lining is we ""only"" paid 10m for a half-a-season loan, instead of 52m in total. If we paid that much we might've as well close down the club. Il Pistolero was phenomenal in his first 6 months with us, and rather crap with Giampaolo and the rest of his tenure. Watching him in Hertha now he seems more like a one-season-wonder than like a proven striker that didn't fit in with us, but the time will tell and good luck to him.
* **Lucas Paqueta (38m)** \- I can't really say he's a flop, but definitely disappointing. I had huge hopes for this guy, at one point he was our best player (in a first couple of months when he came), but somehow never found himself in our formation, he was always switched back and forth. I still have some feeling that he might turn his career around like Hakan suddenly did, but I guess Pioli and management had other plans, so good luck to Lucas, may he lift a WC trophy one day with Brazil.

There were other failed transfers, some were solid, some turned out good in the end, I won't mention those, but I would like to mention Maldini's involvement, practically from the moment when he took all things in his hands (after the departure of Leonardo).

Our signings from then were mostly good, Theo proved to be massive, Bennacer as well. Leao is still shaky but has time to prove himself, he's very talented but his focus needs improvement. We got Salamander for peanuts money, we got Rebic out of nowhere and I think we got really lucky there 'cause seemed to me we got him urgently as we did not know who else to get, and now he's a vital part of our attack and a true fighter.

Duarte and Krunic seem like mistakes for now, but cheap mistakes which we can live with. And this year's transfer window is remarkable, we got really talented players who can contribute to our first-team, on a one season try-out, it's a best possible way to strengthen your squad and plan for the future. Maldini right now seems like a wizard or something.",ACMilan,30m transfers in post-Galliani era,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/j1y1y3/30m_transfers_in_postgalliani_era/,2020-09-29 20:14:51
youngbestest,1601381623.0,j1y1f6,14.0,1.0," Mathias Cardaccio and Tabare Viudez are names only the hardcore Milan fans that have been following the club for more than 10 years will remember. Michalangello Albertazzi and  Alexander Merkel should be more familiar names. These are all past members of our Primavera. I have so many of such names rumbling around my head. 

Players with promise and potential that never materialized. In the mid 2000's I started paying more attention to the legion of youth players in football that never transitioned  to full professionals. This is footballs greatest tragedy.

A lot of these players are ill prepared for any other thing in life, and end up loosing everything by age 20. I read interviews from David Bentley and other failed prodigies. The stories I read were all dark and hopeless. I do not envy any footballer, we only get to see the glitz and not the gloom. 

I don't want this to be a general article on the subject, rather I want it to be a discussion on the measures AC Milan is putting in place to assist young players. In times past we have done a terrible job with player development.  The club has to acknowledge responsibility in the failures of Pato, El shaarawy etc.  We haven't considered  the cerebral health of young players and provided them the needed support. 

Right now we are at a phase where we are going all out on young players, but apart from Gazidi's speaking about forming relationships with the families of players we scout, I have heard nothing more about the human side of these players development.  

Leao was the reason why I brought this up, there has been many comparisons between him and Don Balo. These comparisons base these players on having similiar attitudes . I agree that Leao appears nonchalant on the pitch, but the demons Balo was fighting was of a far different Nature. Leao has the constitution of Ronaldinho, a fun loving character who let the distractions of fame pull him down. C. Ronaldo and Griezmann were headed on the same part, until they were redirected by senior figures. Do we have figures in Ac Milan that will guide this army of youths ?

 Everyone is leaving this job to Zlatan, but he has 2 years tops left in Milan. There has to be a deliberate action by the club to foster a healthy environment where these kids can grow and reach their potential. 

Ajax, Benfica, Monaco and to an extent Bayern have taken steps to get the best out of youth players not just on the field but more importantly off the field.  I expect Paolo Maldini to understand this, his son Christian was lost in the shit show of the Banter era.  

I may be less informed but is anyone aware of any actions by the club in addressing this issue? 

Here are a few articles on this subject.

georgedavidrs,1601379898.0,j1xn1k,0.0,1.0,"Paqueta already reportedly said his farewells to the Milan players and is on his way to Lyon.

Officially fee not reported yet, but mulitple sources, including Loic Tanzy of RMC( Very realiable french news) say it's around 20m. 

Would equate to a -3m loss but i guess with Suso's pure capital gain and the salary relief from his sale, it could be benefitial. 

Next moves?

supermankk,1601161376.0,j0fvb8,13.0,1.0,"So this occurred to me watching some Wesley fofana highlights on YouTube and that got me thinking about our defense and Romagnoli. I feel that he hasn’t been that good at the back and after the restart he was the more shakey of the two between him and kjaer. Granted we can chalk that up to fatigue but I feel that after his 2018 season, we penciled him in as a 7 or 8 every match and he hasn’t been that. Maybe the weight of the armband has something to do with that, maybe not but hopefully he can find his serie A leading form of before. 

Now moving onto gigio. Ever since he’s gotten that captains armband, it looks like he’s found a new level of confidence. Every game he’s the one yelling out to the defense, taking control of the situation. In net, he seems more sure of himself and has made some world class saves over 2020. Gigio getting the armband has also encouraged several outfield players to take more leadership during the game. It almost acts as if there’s two captains out there, one in tune with the back 4 and another focused on the midfield and forwards. 

All I’m saying is that I’ve liked the positive changes that gigio’s shown with the armband while I think romagnoli hasn’t quite found the form he’s had before being named captain.",ACMilan,Do you think we should give gigio the captains armband permanently?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/j0fvb8/do_you_think_we_should_give_gigio_the_captains/,2020-09-27 07:02:56

GianniRivera10,1600864558.0,iy98c3,7.0,1.0,"When AC Milan’s executives go to work on a morning it’s hard to miss the entrance to the museum on the ground floor of Casa Milan, the club’s futuristic headquarters in the Portello district of Milan. Encased in the sloped walls of the pantheon-style trophy room are all the major honours of yesteryear. The centrepiece is a giant replica of the Champions League trophy that Milan have won seven times. 

Over an espresso in the boardroom on the fourth floor, chief executive Ivan Gazidis expresses his ambition to “help the club re-establish itself with weight in the game again”. He calls it “a magical opportunity” and has spent the last 18 months “working out how we strengthen it, how we create a new Milan. But one that has all the values in it, all the feeling of Milan. The Milan we all love and know through the mythology of football.”  This season marks 10 years since Milan last won the Scudetto. They have been absent from the Champions League, a competition they dominated, since 2014. Paolo Maldini lifted that trophy in three different decades as a player. The Milan icon now sits on the club’s executive team as technical director flanked by head of football operations Hendrik Almstadt, sporting director Ricky Massara, 33-year-old chief scout Geoffrey Moncada and a presence from ownership, the hedge fund, Elliott Management. 

“Football teams have cycles,” Maldini tells The Athletic. “We’re lucky that our cycle lasted 25 years, reaching incredible heights during (Silvio) Berlusconi’s time as president. Every club has them. It’s the same for Manchester United, Real Madrid. All these big clubs put super teams together that won everything but they also experienced difficulty at one stage or another in their history.” 

The power of the Milan name endures. “These things don’t disappear,” Gazidis explains. “They’re human relationships that go through generations.” Incarnated in the Maldini family dynasty. “Cesare, my papa, was captain and the first Italian to lift that trophy,” Paolo says, without having to specify the European Cup. The association of Milan and the Maldinis with that competition is implicit.

Milan have bounced back before. Perhaps there aren’t enough people around to remember the title drought between 1907 and 1951 or the relegations of the early 1980s when Franco Baresi went down with the team. They are confident of coming back again. “We’ve seen that with Liverpool,” Gazidis says. “They went through a very long and challenging period but the connection with the club remained there ready to be brought back.”  

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, Milan resumed their place at the top of the game by getting creative. Throughout history the club has a habit of appearing at the vanguard of change in football. From the catenaccio of Nereo Rocco to the pressing and zonal-marking concepts of Arrigo Sacchi, ideas hatched at this club helped football take a great leap forward, transforming it forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

“One memory stands out,” first-team coach Stefano Pioli says, harking back to his playing days. “It was Milan-Verona.” Pioli was on the opposing side that day and has never forgotten the experience. “We managed to come away with a draw but I don’t think we crossed the halfway line once. That was Sacchi’s Milan. We didn’t have a clue what was going on. I don’t know how many times they hit the woodwork. They played twice as fast as anyone else did at the time with great skill and intensity. It was innovative.” 

&amp;#x200B;

MilanLab figured as another example of the club’s place at the forefront of the game’s evolution, prolonging legendary careers like Maldini’s into his 40s with trailblazing sports science. The landscape has changed since he came onto the scene. Maldini is aware of that. Reflecting on his first European Cup in 1989, he says: “The English clubs were banned at the time and if you wanted the best player in the world you could go and sign him no problem. Now there’s huge competition from the German, French, English and Spanish clubs.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Finding an edge is as important as ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Milan prepared their last tilt at European glory after losing to Liverpool in 2005, exacting revenge in Athens two years later, the club ranked fifth in the Deloitte Money League. They made just €53.5 million less than the highest earners, Real Madrid. Now Milan find themselves 21st in the same rich list. They turned over €6 million more than Leicester City in the last rankings and the gap between their revenues and the wealthiest team on the planet, Barcelona, is €634.5 million. Premier League business savvy and huge TV contracts started to outstrip their own, Bundesliga clubs rebuilt their infrastructure ahead of the 2006 World Cup and a golden generation of Spanish players, turbocharged by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and the genius of Pep Guardiola, emerged to usher in a new era of dominance. Serie A fell behind.  The scale of the task is sheer. “Stripping away the emotions, anybody that looks at Milan and Italian football can see the challenges,” Gazidis confides. “But what I have found is surprises in terms of the opportunities.” Maximise them and Milan will be restored to their former glory. “We know the roadmap,” he says. “We’re not Steve Jobs inventing a new product.”

&amp;#x200B;

This is how they’re going about it…Recruitment

When Elliott Management Corporation repossessed Milan from the Chinese entrepreneur Li Yonghong in July 2018 the situation the hedge fund walked into was precarious.  

Previous administrations had swung for the fences with huge net transfer spends in 2015 and 2017 without gaining access to the riches of Champions League. “The financial position was such that we ultimately had to accept a ban on European competition,” Gazidis says in reference to Milan’s failure to fulfil the break-even requirement of financial fair play (FFP).  After Elliott injected €50 million in emergency financing to stabilise Milan’s balance sheet, the new executive team set to work on turning the club around. “All the money we were losing was primarily driven by player salaries and transfer fees which were very high and not reflected in team performance,” Gazidis says.  The wage bill was the second-highest in Serie A and where had it got them? The team Elliott acquired finished sixth.

“This is the big challenge on the football side,” Gazidis elaborates, “We need to be much more efficient in how we use the money we have and we need to improve team performance.” 

&amp;#x200B;

The former MLS and Arsenal executive formed a technical committee that bears some resemblance to the one at Liverpool. Maldini, Massara, Almstadt, Moncada were all appointed to it, with Elliott also having a representative at the table.  Gazidis began to lay out his vision for the technical direction of the club. “Our strategy has to be based first of all on progressive football,” he reiterates. “It has to be football which is modern.” The aim behind it was to seize the initiative on and off the pitch. “I did not want our player identification to be reactive and led by agents,” Gazidis insists. “This had to be a proactive strategy.” 

Processes were put in place to mitigate risk and give the club greater confidence in recruitment. “I wanted to have the right kind of support and collaboration for our directors and that meant having a world-class scouting operation, particularly focused on young players because that was going to be the heart of our strategy. It also meant having a world-class analytical operation which is increasingly and extremely important.”  Milan brought Moncada in to set up and lead a global scouting network. As a kid he was a big Monaco fan. “I was crazy for the team that had David Trezeguet, Christian Panucci, Marco Simone,” he says, excitedly. “There were a number of Italians.”

&amp;#x200B;

Moncada was really no different to you and I in school. He collected Panini stickers, watched the World Cup with his grandparents, and had a crack at making it as a player. His passion led him to Sophia Antipolis, the French version of Silicon Valley where he started working for a Wyscout equivalent. After a few years he tried to get in at Monaco and was taken on by Tor-Kristian Karlsen. The team was in Ligue 2 at the time with Claudio Ranieri in the dugout at the Stade Louis II. “Tor-Kristian called to tell me Ranieri needed a video analyst,” he remembers. “Ranieri was completely mad for video. Everyone talks about Marcelo Bielsa but Claudio was mad for it. He wanted opposition analysis, opposition player analysis, analysis of our own players.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Monaco quickly returned to Ligue 1 and when Riccardo Pecini replaced Karlsen, Moncada’s remit widened. “Riccardo said he needed a scouting coordinator and a video analyst. I had no life,” Moncada laughs. “I worked all week. I was dead. I had a girlfriend but it was impossible to find time to talk to her. I’d work on our opposition in the morning and then go scouting in the afternoon.”  Living the dream wouldn’t be an entirely accurate description even if Moncada loves this game. “It’s not the good life everyone thinks it is,” he insists. “When my mates are out for dinner, I’m in Belgium, France or Brazil. That’s great. But I’m there to watch games.” And network. Intelligence gathering is as much a part of the job as assessing a performance and judging potential. “I’ve seen us described as 007 in the press and to be honest it is a bit like that,” Moncada says. “You have to get there first or at least try to. All the big clubs, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, for instance, do an incredible job of scouting at youth level.” 

&amp;#x200B;

When Monaco changed tack and moved away from paying the big fees invested in Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez, the emphasis shifted instead to spotting talent earlier and finding players like Bernardo Silva and Tiemoue Bakayoko. Instead of going backwards, the team broke new ground wresting the crown of French champions away from PSG and reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2017. The ability to assess a player’s “scope for improvement” is what Moncada looks for in his scouts. “If a 20-year-old player has a terrible game, gets a four out of 10 in the ratings, but has great potential, that’s more important to me. I like it when a scout looks at it that way and says to me: ‘Look, he didn’t have a good game today, but he’s gifted’. We keep tracking him and watch him again.”  

And that’s not all. 

“I don’t need a scout who only goes to games,” Moncada explains. “I need one who watches training, talks to the parents, the academy directors. It’s too easy to go see a game, write your report and be done with it. We can do that from the office. We have to have the intel — the contract situation, what’s the family like, the small details make the difference. Human relations make the difference.” 

Moncada and his team follow players from under-17 level up. “In the space of two years they’re either reserves or first-team players. By that time we’ve already been watching them a couple of years. I want to know the story behind them, their background.”  Old school scouts tend to be sceptical of and in some cases hostile towards data, rolling their eyes when metrics like PPDA (passes per defensive action) and “xG throw-in” come up in conversation. But Milan’s analytics department, which is staffed by a small group of bright 20-something analysts and uses StatsBomb data, has the optimum level of synergy with Moncada while working independently of each other to avoid biases. 

&amp;#x200B;

“In the end we have a comprehensive report with all the info and the statistics,” Moncada says.

The Frenchman then reports to Maldini and shares his expertise with the technical committee as they go through potential targets. 

“All of these things; the clear vision, the clear strategy, the clear philosophy backed by strong processes give us confidence in the decisions we make collaboratively and collectively with Paolo Maldini as the reference point,” Gazidis explains. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s 11 years since Maldini called an end to one of the most illustrious playing careers in the history of the game. The urge to lace up his boots doesn’t come to him when he stands on the sidelines and watches the team warm-up these days. “After 25 years as a pro that chapter was over,” he says. “Even though I was mentally prepared for retirement, I remember two things happening. I was in Miami, pre-season started and I thought to myself: ‘I’m not there. I have to go train’. I missed it a little but I think it did me some good because I didn’t have the stress. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Then there was the time I went back to San Siro for the first time. It was Milan-Inter, week two of the season, and perhaps what you miss most along with the time you spend in the dressing room with your team-mates is the atmosphere in the stadium on nights like that. It happened when Milan played Barcelona in the Champions League too. Let’s say three times and that’s it.”

Rather than follow his father or his team-mates — Andrea Pirlo, Gattuso, Andriy Shevchenko and Sandro Nesta — into the coaching game, the 52-year-old wanted an active role as a director of the club he loves. Listening to each of them describe their own career transition is a fascinating exercise. They all sleep less than they did before and say the principle difference is thinking about a squad of 23 players rather than just themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

“In my role you have to think about 200,” Maldini laughs. “As a footballer, you only have to think about yourself but when you’re a captain you are responsible for other things outside your sphere too. The truth is, as a player, you train, play and go home. It’s hard work but it’s condensed into a short space of time. Coaching in particular has changed in the last 15 years. There was a time when the manager would turn up an hour before training and leave with the players. Now if there’s a session at five o’clock, he gets in at nine in the morning, prepares everything and goes home at nine at night. 

“A technical director has two roles,” Maldini says. “I work at the office. The transfer window is open all year round. You meet agents and people who work in the game. Then there’s the sporting side to it all. You go watch training. We’re in close contact with the team. Then you go to the game.” 

As a job it is all-consuming but then so is his passion for Milan. To Maldini, this is more than a profession. It’s personal. How could it not be given the family’s past and present with the club. “I’ve had eight days’ holiday this year,” he says without complaint. It’s the nature of the game. “I was at the beach but our phones are the tools of our trade and you can always be reached. I tried to say for a few days: ‘I’ll come back to that. I’ll come back to that’. But then there’s this feeling inside.” Maldini can’t leave it alone try as he might. It’s his team, his life.  As a one-club man, the transfer window was extraneous to Maldini, an abstract concept. It did not concern him and distracted from what he felt really mattered. “I always hated it,” he smiles. “My interest was on the game itself.” Maldini had an agent, Beppe Bonetto, but used to take Milan’s former chief executive Adriano Galliani and Ariedo Braida, the sporting director, at their word. The premise of every negotiation was always the same. “I don’t want to leave and I don’t think you want to get rid of me. I practically did the last three or four contract negotiations on my own,” Maldini recalls. “I’d warn my agent. It was still Beppe. I’d tell him I was going in for talks. I did one on crutches after the last Champions League we won (in Athens in 2007). I showed up for the meeting on crutches but they accepted the terms and conditions I asked for.” 

While the thrill of a deal still doesn’t quite compare to the buzz of playing a big game — “Unfortunately you can’t reproduce the adrenaline you feel out on the pitch,” Maldini says — the perception he formed of the transfer market has changed in his two years as Milan’s technical director. “It’s part of the game, a fundamental component, and you know what, I’ve started to like it. What you’re trying to do is put a team together to reach certain objectives. It’s very exciting.”

We speak on the morning of Sandro Tonali’s move to Milan. The 20-year-old midfielder is one of the brightest talents in Serie A and joins the team he supported as a boy. In the afternoon he is due to meet Maldini in the boardroom and put his signature on a five-year deal. Leaning on the financial expertise of the transfer committee, the structuring of the deal itself (€10 million loan fee, €15 million option to buy, €10 million bonus) enabled Milan to get Tonali at a price that was right for them amid crosstown competition from Inter in a challenging market conditioned by COVID-19. The transfer is symbolic of the new Milan in a way. Last summer’s €20 million acquisition of Theo Hernandez from Real Madrid was also indicative of how they now operate. On that occasion Maldini flew out personally to close the deal. It’s a day the 22-year-old Hernandez, who has a legitimate shot at becoming the best left-back in the world, will never forget. Coming to recruit him was arguably the greatest player ever to play his position. 

“Paolo called me up one day and said he wanted to talk. We were in Ibiza and the conversation we had when he said he wanted to sign me was incredible. He showed faith in me and persuaded me this could be my home. I knew him to be a legend and a true great. He gave me lots of advice during that meeting and still now, he tells me things to improve and how I can become more complete as a left-back. To have that insight from For Gazidis this is a fine illustration of the collective and collaborative approach he aspired to create when he became CEO. “To sit Paolo down next to Theo with the benefits of strong scouting and somebody he trusts in Geoffrey Moncada, the benefit of strong analytics and somebody who knows the function of sporting director in the Italian market intricately like Ricky Massara, the benefit of a chief executive who also knows football and has 26 years of experience not just the financial direction, but also the strategic direction we have to go in. Once we are aligned, once all these elements are aligned, and we get these green lights, there is nobody like Paolo Maldini when he believes something to convince a player to come to Milan and to grow his career in football at this great club. And behind all of that you’ve still got the power of the Milan name, which still means something in football.” 

Hernandez never had any doubt about it. He didn’t think twice about committing. Only 10 at the time Milan were last on top of the world, the prestige of the club remains intact. “It was easy for me,” he says, “It is the club that has won the second-highest number of Champions Leagues. It is Milan! I didn’t have to think very long at all. I spoke with my family and representatives but when I heard about the interest, I instinctively knew it was a great place to drive my career forward. Even my grandfather, too, when I told him about the move to Milan, he was very happy and very proud as he has great memories (of Milan teams).”a guy like Maldini is incredible.”

To be clear, Milan’s recruitment has not always been plain sailing. When Elliott assumed control of the club in 2018 it was a summer when the transfer window closed on August 17, leaving the new executive team little time to assemble and prepare the team for the upcoming season. Gazidis arrived in December, Leonardo then left his role as sporting director to return to Paris Saint-German the following summer. Massara joined from Roma as his replacement that off-season along with a new chief football officer Zvonimir Boban. But that didn’t work out and Milan terminated the Croat’s contract in March. 

&amp;#x200B;

“This type of change in thinking and methodology is not easy,” Gazidis says. “It involves some learning on both sides. It involves some dislocation and some disruption but in the end, when we look at the results of this we begin to see what I was saying back in December 2018, which is a Milan that’s now one of the youngest in Serie A with some really exciting young talents who perhaps are not at the peak of their power yet. But I think Milan fans are intelligent enough to see that there is a football project being built here with a very clear direction.

&amp;#x200B;

“This narrative of an internal battle. It’s just not the way I see things. There is only Milan. Milan is above everybody. It’s above every kind of internal interest. The success of Milan is the outcome. There’s no fight about that. The results are better when we have debates. When we have disagreements we bring different skills and different perspectives to the table because we have all of these challenges. We’ve got the financial challenges. We’ve got the challenges of progressing on the football side. 

“What have the results been? The results have been very interesting.”

The men’s team

Pioli enters the clubhouse at Milanello after lunch and conversation quickly turns to the recent European champions. “I started following Bayern closely from January onwards,” Pioli says. “I told my assistants that they’re the team playing the best football in Europe right now. It’s a very intense and aggressive style. All teams at a certain level these days try to press their opponents high and offer the fans attacking football with quick, gifted players. That’s the direction we’re heading in.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Bayern had a perfect record in the Bundesliga after lockdown ended. Milan almost matched them. The only other side in Europe’s top five leagues with a better points-per-game record than Pioli’s was Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid.  On the afternoon we sit down to talk, Milan are preparing for the first of their Europa League preliminaries against Shamrock Rovers. In the end it was no sweat. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the reborn Hakan Calhanoglu took care of business in Tallaght extending Milan’s unbeaten run in all competitions to 14 games. The Swede struck again in Milan’s Serie A opener on Monday night, heading in a cross from Hernandez and sweeping home another goal from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win over Bologna that prolonged their invincible streak. It’s the longest the team has been on since the good old days under Carlo Ancelotti in 2008 and represents quite the turnaround from last Christmas when they went into the winter break on the back of a 5-0 defeat by Atalanta.

By way of explanation, Pioli says: ”It’s definitely down to the work we put in. The players believed in themselves and the scenarios we put to them. I also needed to get to know them and what our identity and philosophy was going to be. By working at it day-in, day-out we were able to reap what we sowed and managed to get some great results.” 

In the event Pioli did not fulfil Milan’s vision for the team, Ralf Rangnick was considered an option for this coming season. But the former Lazio and Fiorentina coach did exactly that and was rewarded with a contract extension. When the rumours about Rangnick whipped up in March, Gazidis spoke to Pioli and reassured him no decision about his future had been taken. He would be judged on the season as a whole and the club appreciated not only the results he achieved but how he put Milan’s interests above his own, focusing on the job in a challenging media environment.  

&amp;#x200B;

“The club was always fair with me,” he said. “Ivan came to the training ground more often than in the past and always showed his regard for me.”  

&amp;#x200B;

Milan had already shown signs of coming together as a team. Ante Rebic clicked in January and couldn’t stop scoring. Calhanoglu started to hit form in a way he had never done before at Milan. Hernandez and Ismael Bennacer came into their own and the defence solidified. 

&amp;#x200B;

“The January window strengthened us with Ibra, Simon Kjaer and Alexis Saelemaekers,” Pioli explains. “In terms of leadership and character they gave us real presence on the pitch. All these factors helped the team grow in confidence and conviction. The talent was already there and we were able to draw it out at the right time.”

The decision to add experience to the youngest team in Serie A was made by the transfer committee as a whole. It was not a defeat for a pro-youth-anti-experience faction. One simply doesn’t exist. Even if the core of the sporting project is based around assembling a rejuvenated squad with upside, red lines on signing veteran players have never been drawn. The impact of Kjaer but particularly Zlatan goes beyond the 11 goals he scored in 20 appearances last season.  “A lot of us are quite young and he knows how to guide and encourage us too,” Hernandez says. “He supports and helps us. In training and games, he still does things that are truly incredible.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“We got what we expected,” Maldini adds. “The team is very young and while it’s confident in some respects, it’s a bit insecure in others. His presence raised the level of competition at Milanello. In football there are things that evolve over time but some things are as true now as they were in the past. Competitiveness in training and its importance is one of these. It’s the only way to raise the general standard of performance in games and it’ll always be like that.”

Zlatan is a master at it,” Maldini continues. “He never wants to lose, not even at cards. I was like that too. My wife used to make fun of me because when I played ping-pong with my kids instead of lose I’d… honestly it doesn’t matter what or who you’re playing. You have to be competitive. It’s your nature as a professional athlete.” 

Even with Zlatan’s arrival from LA Galaxy, the average age of the team last season was 24.9. Bringing that down and cutting the wage bill while experiencing an uptick rather than a downturn in performance is especially encouraging. Now the likes of Gigio Donnarumma, captain Alessio Romagnoli, Rebic, Bennacer, Hernandez, Rafael Leao and Saelemakers are being been bolstered by the arrivals of Emil Roback, Tonali, former France Under-17 captain Pierre Kalulu, and Brahim Diaz (21) as Gazidis and the club’s executive team continues the strategy initiated 18 months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m as excited about the group behind them,” he says. “Let us not forget what is under our nose. We’ve got Lorenzo Colombo and Daniel Maldini coming through our Primavera.” 

The dynasty is moving into a third generation. Daniel already made his top-flight debut in February and scored in the friendly against Monza a fortnight ago. After going viral for the tackle he made on Clarence Seedorf as a boy, the 18-year-old has broken with tradition and plays as a 10 or on the wing.

It’s about time,” Maldini laughs. “Our family has spent a lifetime chasing after other players. Now we have someone who they’re going to have to chase. I can assure you that it’s harder running after the ball than to be chased with it. When you push up like I used to as a full-back you don’t feel anything. But when you have to track back…” 

&amp;#x200B;

Managing expectation and protecting the privacy of his kids isn’t easy. “Look,” he said, “we need to be clear about one thing. Mistakes are definitely going to be made and that goes for their papa too. What you try to do is give them the benefit of your experience. It’s quite similar to what they’re going through now but mistakes will be made. You just try to make as few as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I went through it before with my oldest son Christian who got into our under-19s. I remember his first game when he was eight years old. All the television cameras were there. I know this doesn’t do a kid any good. I also know my boys have always been very at peace with the choices they’ve made. It’s their decision to become footballers. It’s not something that’s been imposed on them.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember being at peace with that decision too (when I was a boy). However I do remember burning up inside when I heard some of the things people said, making allusions to nepotism. These kinds of things should never be part of a young person’s development. Daniel seems very mature to me. He was lucky enough to spend a lot of time with me at Milanello and San Siro. He isn’t a stranger to this world, but he’s discovering the hard part, the sacrifices you have to make.” 

As with Milan’s other talented young players, it is helpful that Zlatan is around to take up so much of the attention. Turning 39 in a few weeks’ time, the Swede’s return to the club and the manner in which the team flourished in the second half of last season is generating cautious optimism. 

“We have made good signings recently,” Hernandez says. “Last season, we started really badly and ended really well. This season, we need to start well and finish well!”

Monday’s win bore his signature and Zlatan’s unmistakable one too. On Twitter he compared himself not for the first time to Benjamin Button and insisted he would have scored four if he were still 20. “We would have won the Scudetto if I’d got here at the start of the season,” the Swede said with typical bravado in July. Belief in the Diavolo having what it takes to lift a trophy is beginning to percolate but it’s the project as a whole that convinces. The same can be said for Milan’s women’s team.",ACMilan,"[James Horncastle for Athletic] Inside AC Milan: Waking a sleeping giant - Words of Gazidis, Maldini, Moncada, Pioli and Theo",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/iy98c3/james_horncastle_for_athletic_inside_ac_milan/,2020-09-23 20:35:58

Both these guys were on the fringes of the club at the end of last season and reacted in two completely different ways. Calabria didn’t give up and set out to prove Pioli wrong and put all his heart into each game including the preseason ones. Meanwhile Paqueta chooses to whine, bitch, moan, and roll his eyes on the pitch (last season more) and seems like his heart is half way there to Lyon. It kinda just made me think watching Calabria today and is really a reminder that for a young player attitude and perseverance will beat out talent every time. Maybe a little reactionary and I know the depth at their two positions is different but what do you guys think.

Do you guys think he is being directly impacted by Ibra's presence? Or is it more of a coming of age and maturity? Let's not forget he is still 24 years old, and many defenders seem to gain ability and confidence later in their careers. He seems to lack mental strength at times, but I hope he continues like this.

Theo- 7.0. Very good game, lovely assist and runs. Was attacking when needed, was defending when needed, and that shot was beautiful. Shame it didn't go in


Gabbia- 6.5. Blocked like 4-5 shots but he's a little insecure and that is gonna penalise him a lot in the future


Kjaer- 6.5. Good game, played well, was a defensive wall today.


Calabria-7.5. I feel like someone kidnapped the old Calabria and replaced him with a new robot cuz there is no way it's the same him. Kept running and fighting, a true warrior for the badge. He was insane today leaving barely any space for the bologna attacks.


Bennacer- 6.5. Did good, wasn't really engaged a lot but he was there.


Kessie- 6. Kessie today wasnt that good. A lot of mistaken passes, sometimes he was very egotistical and wouldn't pass the ball.


Calhanoglu- 7. Brilliant, had his chances but sadly couldn't score.

Rebic-6.5-7. Was doubting whether it was a 6.5 or a 7. He played very well today and had some lovely runs down the wing. Could have scored but it just wasn't meant to be.


Castillejo-5.5. He was bad for 45 mins. Kept falling down injured and never really produced anything.

Ibra-8.5. It's pointless for me to even talk about this.


SUBSTITUTED PLAYERS

Diaz- No rating. Had a few chances but they weren't any good. He's good on the footwork but needs to work on his physical.

Tonali- No rating. Didn't really play that much to determine his rating

Duarte- No rating. Same as Tonali.

Saelemakers- 6.5. He was better than castillejo in my opinion and he was creative this game and created a few chances.

Krunic- No rating. Went in and straight up got a yellow. Didn't play that much to determine his rating.

- I can totally see why Milenkovic would be a great fit for us, the guy covers a lot of space, he pushes up on the field and recovers real quickly, would make a lot of sense in Pioli's system.
- Anyone who think Chiesa is not an update to Castillejo, please think twice, the guy has so much energy and his crosses are poison. He has very good dribble plus he holds the ball way better than Castillejo. If we had the chance to get him I would not think it twice.
- I will miss Jack and is so weird to see him on the Viola shirt, he played ok.

GianniRivera10,1600099301.0,isnqg0,3.0,1.0,"Demetrio Albertini, Milan's historic bandiera and pillar of the Rossoneri midfield in the 90s, was interviewed exclusively by [MilanNews.it](https://MilanNews.it) to talk about the current situation of football, tell some anecdotes of the past and then focus on Sandro Tonali, a player in whom the Metronome is seen again.

&amp;#x200B;

*From the oratories to San Siro and to the largest stadiums in the world. How important is it to maintain the same passion and love for the game to get to the top?*

""I can talk about me, it is especially important in continuity. Football is born as a passion, then it becomes your profession and if you don't get distracted by this passion, love and joy, you can certainly be more continuous. Have constancy for a much longer career. Now we are in an era where everything is burned quickly, on the one hand you become an idol very quickly with the media and social networks, on the other hand you also have the risk of being burned at the same speed. If you are not aware that your profession is football and not popularity, popularity is a consequence of what you do on the pitch. This must always be taken into account"".

&amp;#x200B;

*You played in front of thousands and thousands of spectators. How hard is it for a player to find concentration without the audience you are used to? So at these levels is it more of a con than a pro not having an audience?*

""It all depends on personality, the audience is part of the way we live football, it's definitely a diversity. The thing I regret the most is that sport, like entertainment, is the creation of emotions, and you see the real emotion at the stadium. Now you're creating something, you're playing, but for the footballer, for example if he has to score goals, it's not as exciting as if there were an audience. As far as playing without an audience is concerned, it's almost like playing away from home all the time"".

&amp;#x200B;

*Let's move on to the rossonero chapter. You have played with great champions but which is a player who has surprised you for work ethic and natural talent at Milan?*

""There are many of them, surely Paolo Maldini is under everyone's eyes. If you ask me the best player I played with, I always say Van Basten. Paolo is an incredible talent that I had as a teammate and as captain, his longevity hangs on the reflection of before. He has always been great and has maintained the freshness of his passion for this sport"".

&amp;#x200B;

*One of the memorable nights with the Milan jersey was the final in Athens. How did Cruijff's vitriolic words and the press live in the dressing room?*

""Having finished my career in Barcelona I spoke to him many times, the photo of the Mundo Deportivo on the day of the final with Cruijff and the words ""champions"" were an own goal. It is true that we were missing two great players in Costacurta and Baresi, but it is also true that that team played three consecutive finals, this could not change from the absence of two strong players. We were aware that we were a great group and not just great players"".

&amp;#x200B;

*These were the days of Tonali at Milan. In some interviews she said that football has changed a lot but the Lodi player is a footballer who looks like her. What do you appreciate most about the new acquisition of Milan?*

""There are three things I like so much. One: he is a player who I understand how he can think because he plays in my position. Two: he's Italian. Three: he's young. He's talented, I was very happy with his arrival at Milan because he's taking the step to get on a big stage, he can find some criticisms and changes, but if he keeps the passion we were talking about and the desire to improve he can do very well. Milan for him must not be a point of arrival but a starting point to do great things with this team"".

&amp;#x200B;

*In part Tonali lived a dream shared by some privileged people: to play in his own team of the heart. Was it like that for you too? What could be the advantages and pitfalls of wearing the jersey you support?*

""The pitfalls are linked to the great expectations in a great club, it goes beyond whether you supported that team as a child or not. I can imagine that even if he didn't do the youth sector in Rossoneri the sense of belonging will try to cultivate it, then the club will have to strengthen his desire to do well with Milan"".

GianniRivera10,1600065582.0,isfq9u,36.0,28.0,"**The renewal of Gigio Donnarumma, as well as that of Hakan Calhanoglu, will be tackled by Milan after the closure of the mercato. And this is no longer news, but a fact.** But what is emerging in recent weeks is the type of strategy that Mino Raiola wants to adopt to sit down at the table with the Rossoneri management to deal with the permanence of his client.

**Let's start from a fundamental premise: Donnarumma has reiterated to his agent, to the point of boredom, his desire to remain with the Rossoneri and not wanting to reach a breakup with the club that made him great.** Mino, who knows that to move Gigio to zero would mean a mega commission for him, has taken note of this and will try in every way he can to please him, but without lowering his trousers. It would not be him, it would not be one of the best agents in the world. The negotiation will be and will have to be done in the utmost secrecy, where the whole Donnarumma universe will have to fall into a silent silence until the final decision. Whether it will be red and black or black will only be discovered from October onwards, but there will certainly be a need - on the part of club and ownership - for an important effort. Similar to Ibrahimovic, or perhaps even slightly more so. The figure of 10 million that has circulated is almost a provocation from Mino, who knows the market and has given his word to his client to do everything possible to satisfy him. So, if three years ago there was interference even from outside, this time Raiola wants freedom of action knowing full well what Gigio's desire is, which is to stay with Milan's 99 on his shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

In this phase of the market, the club is mainly committed to the exits. The arrival of Tatarusanu has filled a structural gap in the goalies' department, but Maldini and Massara - under the collaborative supervision of Gazidis - are thinking about sales. But to do them well, the numbers need to match. **This is why Lucas Paquetà cannot be sold for less than 23 million to produce a small capital gain and also why the possible sale of Krunic to Freiburg is more in line with the economic system applied to Milan by Elliott**. If the Rossoneri would accept the proposal of 8 million of the Germans, they would generate a capital gain of 1.6 million that, instead, it was not possible to do with the players who arrived under the Fassone-Mirabelli management and left. This is because they depreciated within a non-competitive AC Milan and because, at the origin of all, they were taken at prices that generated high annual depreciation, making it difficult to sell them to the numbers needed by the Milan budget. In addition, there is the problem of the fees paid in the previous years: Biglia is weighed at 5 million gross per year for 3 years in addition to the 19.7 million paid to Lazio. Reina had a contract of 6 million gross, Strinic of 4. **These are just examples of what this management and this property is struggling with today. All with the FFP collar to go back to.**

&amp;#x200B;

The complex negotiation that led Ante Rebic to become entirely a Milan player and André Silva to take the opposite route, becoming the property of Eintracht Frankfurt, continues to hide the details behind a wall of silence anomalous to the world of the modern football market, with both clubs agreeing to secret the figures of the agreement - as communicated by the Germans. The premise is a must, because to date two plausible scenarios remain, neither of which has been denied by the parties. **The first is that of a devaluation of André Silva's card to 9 million, with Rebic valued at less than one million. The second, which has gained strength in recent hours, is linked to two details. The 9 million that Eintracht will pay to Milan would be the first of two equal instalments that would bring the value of André Silva to 18 million, while that of Rebic would be a little lower which would allow the Germans to turn less money to Fiorentina which boasts 50% on the capital gain exceeding the purchase price paid by Eintracht to the Viola at the time of the acquisition of Ante**. This is why, after a first sign of normal and understandable nervousness in Florence, it seems that the barometer has settled again. It is difficult to think that Milan could affect the relationship with a company with which, until a few weeks ago, it was trying to set up market operations such as those for Milenkovic and Pezzella, without forgetting Chiesa.",ACMilan,"[MN Pietro Mazzara editorial]- Gigio's renewal: Raiola wants a low profile to satisfy him.

Let's say, the injuries of Mexes (inflammation from tanning lights) or Dida (lombalgy caused by a quick rise from the bench), Marco Simone (slipped in the bathtub, happened to Tevez as well), Lentini and Niang (Porsche lesion) or Nesta (Playstation) are not exactly epic - even if the rivals were obviously inspired to right poems about these. Moreover, the injury has to be visible as well - because when the problem comes far away from the camera lens, like for van Basten or in a friendly match like for the unlucky [Graziano 'Lupetto' Mannari (tibia + fibula + ligaments)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graziano_Mannari), it does not have that legendary allure. Which also contributes to the importance of the match. Therefore, the top 3 mythical injuries in Milan history are:

3.  Franco Baresi, Inter - Milan of 1989. Klinsmann breaks his arm with a kick (and instantly understood in which team he plays, one second after asks hysterically for a foul, penalty, sending off and a Scudetto in the court). The Captain, to refresh his old nickname 'Franz' in Beckenbauer's honor, ends the game with the arm to the neck like the German champion.

2. Nestor Combin, Estudiantes -  Milan of 1969. One of the images that made Milan history. Face broken by an Aguirre Suarez punch. Seeing the scenes in TV, [the Argentine president and general, Juan Carlos Ongania, who wasn't afraid to 'share' with his nation a few 'Bastones Largos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Noche_de_los_Bastones_Largos)', gave an order to arrest Suarez - moreover, he arrested Combin for draft evasion.

1. Roberto Donadoni, Crvena Zvezda - Milan of 1988. The defender Vasiljevic, already booked and who scored an own goal which referee Pauly preferred not to see, goes in a harsh late tackle on Donadoni (a few moments before he had served an assist for van Basten), [who is heading the ball: probably the Serb only wants to elbow him, but the clash dynamics is so hard that the 2 heads hit each other violently. Donadoni falls to the ground as if he died.](https://streamable.com/6ffydr)

Anyone who regularly sees football tackles knows there is a particular situation, when the opponents are making desperate gestures to the sidelines, in front of this kick that puts the match on the second place and that made everyone's stomachs shrink (even if for the interista neurons the Battle of Belgrade is just 'the fog match'). On the pitch, Piksi Stojkovic, one of those who promised kicks to the Milanisti since the first leg, who goes against Ancelotti in the tunnel at San Siro, forgets about the feud and puts his hands in his hair. Radovanovic shakes his hands, the veteran Colombo moves away from the scene then collapses heartbroken, the 20 yo Maldini falls on the ground and bursts into tears next to Donadoni. The 120 thousands spectators of the Marakana, [orchestrated by Arkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkan), do not go silent but lower their volume. The TV camera focuses on the agitation next to Donadoni, of whom you can only see the legs, which start moving in rather reassuring spasms. In that moment, Roberto has a violet face and clenched teeth, doctor Monti is forcing his mandibula to take out his tongue which ended up in the back of his throat, saving the player's life.

 (\&amp;#x200b;) 

Donadoni: *I do not remember anything. My first clear image is when I woke up in the hospital in Belgrade. There were two men with me: one was a terminal stage patient, he had a severe tumor and was asking me how I was, the other fell from the 3rd floor, didn't have a single bone in the right place but was peeling tangerines and was squeezing the juice on my lips, because I could not open my mouth or eat anything. They were way worse off than man and were preoccupied by my state as if I was in the worst situation: what a wonderful explanation to understand how lucky I was.*

Sandro Sabatini, at that time, Tuttosport journalist, left the stadium to follow the midfielder to the hospital*: In the next room, an old lady was listening the game: I do not understand a single Serbian word, but when it's noisy, they're attacking, when it's silent, Milan are pushing forward. Meanwhile, I had 'sent' my piece via the payphone at the hospital. The penalty shootout was played and my intutition told me that Milan were through. I return to Donadoni and tell him 'Roberto, you made it, Milan has won'. I see a tear falling from his left eye.*

(...maybe you were expecting something else from a Donadoni description) (like Luci a San Siro, the first true transfer of Berlusconi - which on top of all[, broken the jus primae noctis Juventus had over Atalanta's players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droit_du_seigneur)) (the dribbles, the assists, the dummies, the crosses) (Holy Mother of God, Donadoni's crosses from left to the right) (the six Scudetti, the three European Champions Cups, the always unexpected goals, apparently not unsaveable, which would leave top goalkeepers fulminated) (his shy character, not mediatic or extrovert enough for the Italian National Team) (the economic support to [Angelo Anquiletti's family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Anquilletti), who had followed the same path from Atalanta to Milan one generation earlier) (but we chosen this story because even if he's not the first face that pops in your mind when you think about the biggest gladiators of our story that commenced in 1899, Roberto Donadoni from Cisano Bergamasco wears Milan on his face, on that jaw which remained slanted) (and you'd agree that in such a book with his name, we could not not include the story of that face, that from time to time risks to display a crooked but contagious smile) (...sure, these being said, we cannot only depict him fallen to the ground, senseless or connected to the machines in the hospital) (therefore, we conclude with Donadoni watching another Milanista)

*Almost all of Rivera's moves left you speechless. The elegance was compensating for the little physical strength, his body feints that were bewildering opponents, the pleasure of making other score: that was my idea of football, also because I was never a great finisher. In fact, when I wore my first pair of* [Adidas Rivera](https://imgur.com/a/TKlP0zE)*, black with red stripes, I felt like I was flying.*

Happy 57th birthday to Roberto 'Luci a San Siro' Donadoni, one of the greatest right wingers in AC Milan, club for which he played 390 matches in 12 seasons (1986/87-1995/96; 1997/98-1998/99), scoring 23 times and winning 6 Scudetti (1987-88, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1995-96, 1998-99), 3 European Champion Cups (1989, 1990, 1994), 2 Coppe Intercontinentali (1989, 1990), 3 European Supercups (1989, 1990, 1995), 4 Italian Supercups (1989, 1992, 1993, 1994), 1 Mundialito (1987). Donadoni has also represented Italy 63 times, scoring 5 goals, losing the 1994 World Cup final in the process.

He also played with Atalanta (B and A, 1982-86), MetroStars New York (A, 1996-97), and Al Ittihad (A, 1999-00).Donadoni has coached Lecco (C1, fired during the 14th day and recalled during the 2001-02 season), Livorno (B and A, 2002-03, 2004-05 (took over), 2005-06), Genoa (B, fired during the 2003-04 season), the Italian national team (2006-08), Napoli (2009), Cagliari (2010-2011), Parma (2012-2015), Bologna (2015-2018), Shenzhen (2019-2020).",ACMilan,[Facce da Milan] Roberto Donadoni... or the Uzbek,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/ipd4gn/facce_da_milan_roberto_donadoni_or_the_uzbek/,2020-09-09 18:05:12

Samkazi23,1599546955.0,ioopn4,1.0,1.0,"AC Milan v Vicenza, Wednesday afternoon at Milanello. After the friendlies against Novara and Monza, it’ll be the Rossoneri’s third pre-season outing, with this also being the case for the side coached by Mimmo Di Carlo, who also had a long spell as a player at the same club.


After managing to bring in striker Gabriele Gori from Fiorentina on loan ahead of the upcoming friendly with AC Milan, sporting director Magalini, who was employed in the same role at Alessandria when they faced the Rossoneri in the semi-finals of the 2015/16 Coppa Italia, will be looking to secure the services of other attackers. Tommaso Biasci and 22 year-old Nicola Dalmonte, who recently enjoyed a good season in Serie B at Trapani, have been linked with the Biancorossi.



During pre-season, Vicenza have faced two Serie A sides so far. In their first outing, they held their own against Gotti’s Udinese, who narrowly won 3-2 thanks to goals from Coulibaly, Micin and Nestorovski. Meggiorini and Guerra scored for the Biancorossi.


A couple of days ago, they came up against Lazio in Auronzo di Cadore and once again suffered a 3-2 defeat. Inzaghi’s team were made to work hard to secure the victory: after Lazzari had given the Biancocelesti the lead, Ierardi and Gori put Vicenza in front. Lazio then responded through Luis Alberto’s brace. Former Rossoneri player Pepe Reina played the full 90 minutes.

HommoFroggy,1599224850.0,imflpd,74.0,1.0,"The RW and RB situation really raise a lot of shoulders between Milan fans and not only in this sub but in other mediums as well. I will be focusing about the RB situation here and give my 2 cents, the situation is more complicated then it looks and here are my reasons why.... 


1) Firstly one between Calabria and Conti has to leave and the more favorable would be Calabria cause he is an academy graduate and thus it is a full on profit in the eyes of FFP. On the other hand it is the market and the valuation of the player, yea many teams might be interested in him but putting down a fee that would be fair in this market is hard enough and not to mention that Milan need liquidity so find a team whom is ready to pay that fee now in cash cause those money will have to be reinvested in the market. 


2) The options available and to find someone cost efficient regarding if he would be a short, mid or long term investment. Looking at the RB market it is hard to find options, the options are either short-mid term very expensive solutions like Bellerin for example or relatively expensive mid-long term investments which in the MOST LIKELY scenario would make Pioli start Conti in short term till they adapt like Emerson Royal and it is not worth the risk. On the other hand are players whom are very slight improvements hypothetically/arguably to Conti or Calabria but the parent clubs of those players ask a relatively high amount of money for them, to put it short in a hypothetical situation, Milan would sell Calabria for around 10-12 mil while Tottenham want 18-20 mil for Aurier, while arguably Aurier would be an improvement it isn’t value wise as far as money goes thus not cost-efficient while Milan COULD agree if the difference between the 2 players was 2/3 mil and thus taking a risk. 


3) Also there are players which isn’t worth the while taking the risk atm considering the importance of the season. Some that come to mind are Odriotzola, whom has shown great talent but at 24 year old is very raw and unproven. Someone like Florenzi for example whom it seems being outside of Romas plans and has shown to be very reliable when he is fit and would cost relatively cheap but he is rarely fit misses a bunch of matches while the same situation we can say for Conti. I can mention someone like Lirola shows promise but goes hot and cold while costing more then we would sell Calabria and the problem stays the same both are inconsistent players.",ACMilan,Our RB situation is more complicated then it looks!,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/imflpd/our_rb_situation_is_more_complicated_then_it_looks/,2020-09-04 21:07:30

geo0rgi,1598950223.0,ikgrr9,78.0,0.0,"The transfer market so far has certainly been interesting and unpredictable. With Maldini in charge it feels like no one is certain what exactly his moves are going to be. It could be interesting if someone here can try and guess what the remaining transfers are going to be both incoming and outgoing. 

Please be realistic, the idea is to try and get as close as possible by the end of the summer. 

I will start - I think we are going to get Milenkovic in some sort of a swap with Paqueta, but I think this will happen in the later days of the mercato. It looks like Milenkovic wants to play with us and Fiorentina are risking on letting him go on the last year of his contract, which will reduce his price. So by the end of the mercato I will not be surprised if they agree on some sort of a deal with us.

Another one joining is probably going to be Bakayoko, but I think this one can drag along for quite a while. Chelsea most probably don’t want to send him out on a loan, but we hold all the leverage here. They don’t need him in the squad and not many teams are interested in him. I think Maldini is just going to keep going until Chelsea eventually let him go on a loan with option.

GianniRivera10,1598901751.0,ik4mfk,1.0,1.0,"'Sacchi was frequently talking about Gullit's thing. When he would get angry, he was telling Ruud he was thinking with his dick. When he was happy, he'd mock - 'how can you live with that dick', 'how much does it weigh' etc. One day, Gullit, under the showers, tells Sacchi: 

*&lt;&lt;You know, Mister, one of my relatives had to shorten it.&gt;&gt;* 

Sacchi, stunned, asks him: *&lt;&lt;Really?&gt;&gt;* 

*&lt;&lt;Yes, yes, he gave up on half of it.&gt;&gt;*

*&lt;&lt;But Ruud, what did they do with the other half?&gt;&gt;*

Instantly, Ruud replies: *&lt;&lt;They put a cap and some sunglasses on it and nowadays he's coaching Milan&gt;&gt;.*

I saw people rolling on the floor from laughter.' (Roberto Donadoni)

\*\*\*\*\*

Even if the legend tells us mostly about van Basten, it was not him who made the revolution. Because the revolution of Berlusconi's Milan commenced on that day back in 1987 when during the press conference presenting this guy in via Turati, journalists showed him a giant poster of Gianni Rivera, he politely asked: *&lt;&lt;Who is he?&gt;&gt;.*

The moustache. The red and black caps with the attached dreadlocks. People who did not know him in the first matchday (different times): some were saying he's a libero, some were calilng him a regista. The reggae albums [(the Revelation Times, not really the Wailers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxWRw-3tJ28). The Verona defenders who exit the field asking *&lt;&lt;What is he made of? We tried to butcher him and hurt ourselves.&gt;&gt;*. [Ferri, who in the first Derby, only feeling him arrive in the box, goes into disarray and scores in his own net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgPIz3PvpeY). [Zenga, who in the return Derby, throws himself backwards in the goal to avoid being hit by his cannonball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTTPRkCQxjo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=50) (just like the chant says: *Spacca il palo e la traversa, Rudi gol, tira giu la porta, tira giu la porta!*). Gullit who goes against Sacchi's request on the 31st of December (no parties!) only to come next morning from training directly from Sanremo with confetti in his hair. [Two days later, Milan destroy Napoli at San Siro: goal, assist, a shot on the post and a mustached but consoling smile at the end of the game towards Maradona who had declared Gullit is 'just a bluff created by Berlusconi's TVs'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKzMmhuUOrQ). [Bruscolotti who in the return match gives him a kick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Bruscolotti) \- when the ball was out of play - and sees him reply: *&lt;&lt;What are you doing? You know that if I kick you, I'll ruin you?&gt;&gt;* (after this, he had ruined Napoli's defence assisting Virds and van Basten). Affairs with models, journalists and many other professional categories. [The Ballon d'Or dedicated to Nelson Mandela](https://imgur.com/a/OSuGvFg). [Gullit in orange who is laughing with van Basten, after they both scored against the USSR in the 1988 European Championship final](https://imgur.com/a/MEaflAi)\- with all the Milanisti feeling more Dutch than Erasmus from Rotterdam. The customers of the Belgrade hotel terrorized - calling the reception asking whether there's an earthquake - no, it's a Milan player warming up on the hotel's hallway. Gullit, who unlike other recent Milan players, learns Italian from day 1. The answer to Berlusconi request before the final run of the season - one month of abstinence (yep, Berlusconi) - 'President, I cannot run with my balls full.' Boskov who dictates *&lt;&lt;Gullit is like stag coming out of forest.&gt;&gt;*. Real Madrid's locker room, which saw fights between their defenders and midfielders: *&lt;&lt;You want to try to mark him?&gt;&gt;*.

Then Fabio Capello, who is in love with van Basten, but not with Rudi. And imposes to the 'stag' a continuous rotation. Gullit, in despair, hangs Capello on the changing room's wall. Capello who gets revenge and leaves him out of the final against Marseille. Gullit who leaves and joins the most joyous Sampdoria ever. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Ruud Gullit, [the Raisuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulai_Ahmed_er_Raisuni), as he was defined by Carlo Pellegatti in his prime, inspired by the movie '[The Wind and the Lion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073906/)', was a revolution. For Milan, who accidentally, through that genuine question (*Who is he?*), found a new spirit: that club, which since Golden Boy's retirement was a small satellite in Italian football, shook off its inadequancy and complexes and put the inexhaustible energy of the Dutch Colossus at the service of thinking legs of Donadoni, Virdis, Van Basten (no one ever pointed it out, but the goodbye of the Utrecht Swan coincides with the one of the Black Tulip). And it was a revolution for everyone in Italian football, which was taken by storm by a player, putting aside his inclination towards the blissful life, had nothing in common with Diego Armando Maradona: not only because he was more inclined to smile than to fight against everyone, but also because he was gifted by Mother Nature with excessive physical power flowing in a playstyle that was very, very far away from Maradona's. His style amazed Italian football in the late 80s, Italian football which was devout to classy dancers like Platini, Falcao, Bruno Conti, Maradona or Rivera. The media were shook, but for our fortune, they were not yet ready to jump on his back like they did on the VIP dipwads who succeeded him: no adverts, no paparazzi outside restaurants, you could easily meet him on the streets around Piazza Castello where he lived, whilst he was pushing a baby buggy. Today he has 6 children. But he's 20 years younger than Mick Jagger, he can still equal him.

(Paolo Madeddu)

Hass_s,1604056823.0,jkux7n,38.0,1.0,"I can't recall the last time the general atmosphere around our team has been so positive . It seems every facet in our footballing entity is at it's peak . 

Our management is stable with no issues , we don't have to worry financially, the plans for the new stadium are going ahead , and we even have Gazidis saying that no player is bigger than the team and we only want players that want to stay here and give for the shirt.

Our transfers have been shrewd and solid considering FFP. We got rid of a lot of deadweight , the organization as a whole just oozes class and we don't have any internal issues even with news outlets trying to start something.

Pioli is the coach we have been asking for since allegri. He's excellent tactically , tries to accommodate for any issues his formation has , plays for the strengths of players available , works in silence and with humility and most importantly provides the father figure our youngsters need to play wi confidence and purpose.

Player quality has improved since our banter years and now we have players worthy of the shirt in every position and even on the bench. Some players are having the form of their lives and whenever someone's performance drops we have a ready bench player to step up .

This all translated into an excellent form in both the league and Europa league , despite the vital absences we had at the start of the season, and not having our strongest XI on the field yet.


Saying all this, I'm still wary of a drop of form or a surprise negative result (which will happen eventually) and how our young team would react to it . I'm also worried of how our infamous reactionary fan base would react once our purple patch ends

The story mentions that it would be worth hundreds of millions for each participant each year and would be made up of 18-20 teams with 5 being from England and Real Madrid being the other confirmed member since they are helping set it up.  With our history and our great relationship with Madrid, I actually think there is a decent shot that they would ask us to join if it was created.  I mean if Arsenal or Tottenham are invited, how would they not ask us too? Anyway...

I'm opposed to the league being created since I love the CL format and think this would harm the game generally, but if it is created then I would want Milan to take part I think.

Out attacking play in the final third is always pass the ball to the wing and let them cross the ball to Zlatan. Now, im not saying that, this is a bad thing to do, alot of proven teams use this tactic, like Real Madrid, Liverpool and others. but the problem is, this is all we do other than some magic from Calha, but if he is having a bad day, then its just crosses all day long. Even if Roma’s attacking is nice to see on the eyes but they couldn’t really do much against us, all their goals came from set piece and headers. 
So in conclusion, our current tactic is fine but i just hope we add more to our game so we can have more to our arsenal.",ACMilan,Our attacking play,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jj2ich/our_attacking_play/,2020-10-27 22:49:06

Last season was that great for him but since its his first season , i didn’t judge him. 
Now fast forward to this season, for the past few games he has been starting partly because of rebic’s absence. And he has been great, contributing to goals and assist. He is really good at dribble, dropping his shoulder and cruse pass defenders. But for some reason, he rarely gets involve in the game. For example, the match against roma, he had 3/3 dribbles, if im not mistaken, 2 of it lead to goal. He doesn’t much defensively compared to guys like alexis and samu.

What pissed me off most was the Zlatan Yellow! didn't even foul anyone, his hand was below Mancini's chest, and Zlatan didn't even get in his face or anything, just asked to check for a handball. Does anyone know if the yellow can be revoked? 

What makes this whole situation funnier is that apparently he was suspended for having a private FB with by the name of Jack O'Melly where his cover pic was him and Totti.  Here's the link :

Samkazi23,1603754586.0,jipu6k,9.0,1.0,"#*Eight statistics that you need to know following tonight's draw at San Siro*

AC Milan’s showdown with Roma on matchday five in Serie A ended up finishing all square. It was a real goal fest on a rainy Monday night at San Siro, with the two sides playing out a 3-3 draw. On the scoresheet for the Rossoneri were Saelemaekers and Ibrahimović, who was able to bag a brace. Here are eight facts that you need to know following the match, with the Swedish striker taking centre stage:

1- AC Milan have scored at least two goals for eleven consecutive matches, equalling their record from 1959.

2- Zlatan Ibrahimović has scored more than once for three matches in a row: the last player to achieve this feat in Serie A was Cheick Diabaté in 2018.

3- The Swede's finish after just one minute and 48 seconds was the fastest league goal he's scored in an AC Milan shirt.

4- The Swedish striker has scored ten goals against Roma in Serie A: out of the players who are still playing football, no one has done better.

5- AC Milan have scored in each of their past 21 games in all competitions: the Rossoneri haven’t done better than this since September 2017.

6- Only taking into account Serie A, AC Milan have scored for 25 consecutive matches: this is the Rossoneri’s longest scoring streak since 1973.

7- AC Milan are the only side to have scored the first goal in all of the matches they’ve played this Serie A season.

8- Rafael Leão provided two assists today, as many as in his previous 34 matches in Serie A.",ACMilan,AC MILAN V ROMA: ALL THE NUMBERS,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jipu6k/ac_milan_v_roma_all_the_numbers/,2020-10-27 07:23:06

Stoiick,1603569093.0,jhffc8,18.0,1.0,"Isn't Funny that we got dropped by 1 brother and got picked up by the other Brother!

&amp;#x200B;

For thoses who don't know Adidas and Puma, the two brands were created by two brothers born in the small town of Herzogenaurach,  Adolf Dassler (**Adidas**) and  Rudolf Dassler (**Puma**).

The two brothers used to work together, they founded the shoe manufacturing company Sportfarbrik Gebrüder Dassler, or Geda for short.

Despite the complex political climate in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, **Geda** became a success, which was demonstrated in the [1936 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics) where the legendary African-American runner [Jesse Owens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens) wore Geda shoes as he won a gold medal. 

Geda's operations were paused throughout World War II, as Rudolf was drafted into the German army and Geda's shoe factory was converted into a weapons factory. After the war ended, Rudolf returned  following one year of imprisonment (**\******more about this below***), and Geda's operations resumed.

In 1948, after over 30 years of working together, Adolf and Rudolf abruptly shuttered Geda and separated. Two reasons for the feud that are cited are strife between their respective wives, who did not get along, yet were forced to live in the same villa, and (**\***) Rudolf's increasing suspicion that his brother Adi was behind his conscription into the army and thus his short imprisonment by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II), because Rudolf had fled the front in 1945 and was arrested on his way back, Adolf gave the US occupiers information about his brother to get him out of the way.

According to another theory, Adolf was jealous of his brother, something was rumoured to have happened between Rudolf and his brother's wife, and he was known as a womaniser. 

In 1948 Rudolf established [Puma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)), which was initially named Ruda (short for *Ru*dolf *Da*ssler) but later was renamed Puma after the animal. In 1949, Adolf established [Adidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas), likewise named after himself (*Adi* *Das*sler). Geda's workforce and resources were split between the brothers. Adidas kept the factory by the train station and two-thirds of Geda's employees, as most employees preferred Adolf's emphasis on product development over Rudolf's sales-oriented approach. Rudolf kept the factory on Würzburger Street and the remaining third of the workforce. 

Little did the brothers know that their rivalry would change the sporting goods industry forever, nor that it would still be profoundly shaping the small town of Herzogenaurach, where both companies are based, to this day.

In the following three decades, both Adidas and Puma rose to dominance and signed deals with athletes such as [Muhammad Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali) and [Joe Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Frazier) (Adidas) and members of the Brazilian national football team (Puma). Adidas introduced shoes customized for different sports, and grew rapidly. Puma, driven by Rudolf's sophisticated sales approach, kept chasing Adidas throughout these decades.

Rudolf died in 1974 followed by Adolf in 1978. The brothers were buried at opposite ends of Herzogenaurach's cemetery.

&amp;#x200B;

## Division within Herzogenaurach Town:

The river [Aurach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurach_(Regnitz,_Mittelfranken)) divides [Herzogenaurach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzogenaurach); Puma's factory was to the south and Adidas's factory to the north. Puma and Adidas were the biggest employers there, and at least one person from each family worked for one of these companies. Employees of the two firms and their families avoided speaking to each other; they patronized separate bars, bakeries and barber shops. From people's habit of looking at each other's shoes to see whether they were affiliated with Adidas or Puma, Herzogenaurach got the nickname ""the town of bent necks"".

The two biggest football clubs in Herzogenaurach, FC Herzogenaurach and ASV Herzogenaurach, were sponsored by Puma and Adidas respectively. As a result, a strong sporting and personal rivalry formed between the players and the fans of each of these teams.

Celebration is due, but it wouldn't be the first time in the history of football that the joy for a crucial win messed up concentration for the next game, we had a clear example couple of years back when we crashed in Marassi after stopping Juve at home. 

  
Next match is against Roma, in my opinion one of the worst opponents we could meet right now. They're a solid team which has performed well lately, but not strong enough for us to play with nothing to lose. For the first time in years we'll have to bear the pressure of being the undisputed favourite side in a big match and holding up some serious expectations. Winning at Rome would be a true statement. Much bigger than the derby, which shows what we already knew in the last months, which is that we can finally win against any team. The true test for our maturity, which will determine what realistically could be our goals for the season, will be to win as the Capolista after such a drunking joy and prove we are afraid or nothing.

Gardauvali,1603031852.0,jdhdc6,8.0,1.0,"God i just realized how I missed these feelings: 

1. waking up the next morning after winning the derby

2. rivalry watching making full sense again(Second best football-watching experience after watching our own games for me) 

and what a day it was! Everyone somehow canceling each other out to even things! this +3,4,5 points could prove vital in the end(as it has before...). and tbh I don't mind what happened to Napoli,  we've suffered so much I'll take everything (within the framework of justice) thrown at us atm. 

on top of all good feelings, i'm VERY excited for the EL campaign... Im glad luck was with us to make it to the group stage for a particular reason:  with all the talent in the team i bet its gonna give us a huge hand in our quest for Top four(or...) in Serie A. Team depth vital as ever,  its clear that many of the newcomers(and not only) need playtime to adjust and grow... and not so tough, not so easy group stage(at least) without extra pressure can turn out to be a perfect training platform for our youngsters.  

I'm glad we can finally line up an alternative team that will be VERY exciting to watch. 

For the likes of Hauge, Diaz, Tonali, Gabbia, Dalot, Maldini, Colombo, Conti maybe Kalulu and even Leao and Krunic this could be a perfect occasion to speed up their adjustment/improvement processes.

It's clear that most of these lads have a high ceiling and we need them at first team level and rhythm asap.  + Pioli has been proven over and over to be excellent at bringing the best out of his players(and im sure most of our starters have room to improve too still)

Hope Musacchio's recovery is quick as well... Simon has been playing non-stop for us and the national and needs some breathing time... 

I hope we see at least Hauge, Diaz, Leao, Tonali and Dalot from the first minute. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. 

My take from yesterday was that tbh we were lucky  not to concede but also lads stayed together, played as a unit and that spirit that has been missing for years is surely there!  

 I love how bold and courageous Pioli is and that the team is following. We pressed high with numbers, leaving their attackers and wingers(after their rapid switch of play) 1v1 with the defenders which is high risk high reward game.. and Inter's whole game is built on exploiting that time and space before our second line catches up...  but that is our game and we stick to it. and it pays when we are so fast and neat with the ball... BUT What concerns me a little bit is (and that's what happened in the last derby also ) we start out making the best use of the ball with vertical passes and quick (counter)attacks, and we are sooo effective with it but after those 2 goals we did not attack with the same intent, determination and precision...  Sure, the team has a long way to grow into a side who's dangerous with every attack, but its just disappointing that we see that the quality to have those kinds of attacks is there, yet we somehow hesitate after taking a lead... So, that's one direction the team has to grow. we clearly needed a goal to seal the game as it looked almost certain they were gonna score... 

Kudos to Pioli for switching the play at the right time with right subs... honestly, after we defended in numbers and they didnt have those spaces to exploit, we stalled the game fairly well.. whatever chances Lukaku had afterwards was clearly on Roma, unfortunately. coming out of a 3 months injury there might not be a tougher job than facing that Monster, often times isolated 1v1...",ACMilan,"I'm excited to see our ""2nd team"" play EL",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jdhdc6/im_excited_to_see_our_2nd_team_play_el/,2020-10-18 22:37:32

Donnaruma isn’t the best at distrubuting the ball well when under pressure.( i believe he have been gradually improving over the years.) Teams know this, and they are pressesing us high, blocking off our best supply line which is kessia and bennacer. So he either kick it up to ibra or past it too out centre backs, and they will end up playing the long ball to ibra as well. I feel like we are playing too many long balls.

Not sure why, in my opinion Rade is better in defense than Hakan and would've helped Theo a lot against Hakimi that was a constant threat. And also, Casti instead of Saelemaekers was a confusing decision. He was so lost on the field and didn't contribute defensively.
Nevertheless, quality of our game didn't drop but I find those subs as very confusing. On the other hand, Pioli has shown on multiple occasions that he knows what he's doing. I can't remember any other coatch in the last few years that we weren't angry at because of poor first team starters pick.

The average comes out at 71.6, so let's round that to 72 just for good measure. With 34 more matchdays to go and with maximum number of points in first 4 matchdays, Rossoneri need to have an average of 1.765 points per game counting from matchday 5 to matchday 38.

Now for the more optimistic ones, I've done the math for title race. 

The average points for Scudetto winners from 15/16 until 19/20 comes out at a round number of 90. With 34 more matchdays and having 12 points from 4 matchdays, Rossoneri need to have an average of 2.3 points per game from matchday 5 to matchday 38 to have 90 points at the end of the season and win the Serie A.

There you go guys, I was a bit bored while quarantining and the thought crossed my mind so I've done the math.
With a strong start like this, and if we keep winning the 6 pointer games like tonights. Don't know, I feel we got a shot at Scudetto.
But winning all the games that we should win, against weaker opponents should keep us suffice for UCL.

In the big match of matchday 4 in Serie A, AC Milan flew highest at San Siro to go top of the league after a tough game. This magical evening is underpinned by the numbers - both for the team and individuals - from the 2-1 win:

1- AC Milan have won their first four games in a Serie A season for the first time since 1995/96, with Fabio Capello in charge.

2- This AC Milan's 1400th win in Serie A since it has been played in a round-robin format. The Rossoneri are the third side to reach this landmark after Juventus and Inter.

3- AC Milan had not won a Milan Derby since January 2016 - 3-0 with Siniša Mihajlović as head coach.


4- AC Milan have scored in 24 consecutive Serie A games for the first time since 1973 (29).

5- This is only the second time that AC Milan have conceded their first goal in a Serie A season to Inter; the only other time was back in 1935 (with Meazza).

6- Zlatan Ibrahimović has scored the most Serie A braces at over 38 years of age (four) - equalling Silvio Piola.

7- Zlatan Ibrahimović has scored eight goals in the Derby di Milano (six with AC Milan and two with Inter), only three players have scored more: Meazza (twelve), Nordahl and Nyers (eleven).",ACMilan,FACTS AND FIGURES AFTER INTER V MILAN.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jd2iyl/facts_and_figures_after_inter_v_milan/,2020-10-18 04:28:46

arshadshabick,1601959786.0,j5z1co,26.0,1.0,"This mercato have been great, i would give 7-8 out of 10, but we are still lacking in fee positions. 

1.The obvious one is cb, we tried hard to find the right cb but unfortunately couldn’t finish the deal.  We still have decent depth there , only problem being most of our cb’s get injured very easily. 
 2. Centre forward. Ibra is the best but he can get injured easily too. Colombo and maldini are still very young and raw. Colombo seems like a target man and can hold up the ball. While maldini seems more like a firmino and benzema, where he can link up the play. Having 2 strikers with different attributes is always nice. Having another established striker would makes things alot easier. 
3. The RW. Im in love with salemaker now. The boy works really hard for the team and sacrifices alot. But alot of attacks starts and buildup from the left. Team could predict our gameplay then, if you could have a better option in the rw, it will make us more unpredictable . Same getting back on form with solve that problem but for now sale is better than samu. 
4. Brahim diaz. He looks very promising although tried to dribble too much and lose the ball easily. But thats not my concern, im more worried about his positioning. He likes to play in CAM position. Even if he starts from the left, he drifts to the centre which disturbs hakan’s positioning. Now if you want me to choose between hakan and diaz at the 10 role, there is only one winner. I hope he gets his position better and hopefully can play in RW .
6. Last but not the least, Leao. This guy is definitely  talented but his work rate gotta improve. Now , i do realise he just came back and didn’t have a proper preseason but still, you gotta show more enthusiasm on the pitch when u come in .",ACMilan,My concerns for the squad,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/j5z1co/my_concerns_for_the_squad/,2020-10-06 12:49:46

Duarte is in a distance 5th but can also be used if needed.

I'm more worried about congestion in the RB spot since Calabria has finally shown good form and Dalot has the potential to challenge him there.

I don’t think people understand how lucky we have been so far this year, we have no real back up striker, and are betting on a 39 year old to play 3 competitions. Our game against rio ave showcased how badly we need an experience centre back in case we have an injury to a starter, gabbia and Musacchio are not up to par. We needed a right winger because castillejo is not up to par and we didn’t even try, deulofeu went to a worse serie A team, granted they have the same owner as Watford. It’s ridiculous that with our first real run of form in years, all we could do to better the team was to bet on players such as hauge, Diaz, and Dalot (both not even signed just dry loans).

You might remember me posting a survey on “Fan Identification in Football” in this subreddit a few months ago as part of my bachelor thesis in Sport Management. I wanted to thank all of you who took part, as I reached almost 5.000(!) participants which made my research a lot more meaningful. Thanks to you I managed to score 94% on my thesis and graduated top of my class! My thesis will be published as an article in an academic journal in a few months time, which is something I am quite proud of. I was recently admitted to a masters degree program in Sport Management in Cologne/Germany, so I am excited for what’s to come! I thought I would post a short presentation of the results, your picks of favourite football clubs/players and general observations as some people were interested in the results and I want to give something back for all the support. The full thesis and findings will have to wait until the article is published, but I will definitely link it here once it is. Thanks again boys and girls, much love!

Aniket_1992,1601626776.0,j3qs42,18.0,1.0,"So after somehow surviving yesterday without getting any heart attack, had a few points in mind for discussing what actually happened. First of all kudos to both the teams for making the match feel like a UCL final, I doubt this year any match is going to top this in terms of suspense and drama.

Coming to negatives first as the positives are barely few things.

1. Pioli messed this one up, not to take any credit away for what he has done with the team but I think he underestimated the opponents way too much, the starting lineup was basically having no attacking threat at all even though we could have chosen a better lineup.

2. This should be Samu’s last start with the team, he has not stepped up and I think the RW belongs to Salad/Diaz for now and maybe even Hauge. I guess Samu single handedly messed up our final third, he gave away 90% of the balls, I think the original plan was for Daniel, Hakan and Samu to link up and break down their defence but you cannot do that if one guy is constantly shitting on every ball given to him.

3. Daniel’s hold up play not good enough, the thing is when you don’t have effective wingers with Salad being ineffective in attack on LW and Samu being completely shit on RW all we have left is for CF and AMF to combine and break down the defence which I believe was not the Plan A. Everytime Daniel had his back to goal and received the ball he was shoved off. Again this was a misjudgment from Pioli as we have Colombo who could have been much more effective. Also not sure if you guys noticed, Theo actually tried to do a lot today to supplement the attack from his frequent crosses but again Daniel cannot pluck the ball from the air and distribute, he is not a Target man.

All in all I think the initial decision by Pioli cost us precious first 45mins which I think is more important than second half because we intend to finish off the game early especially during the start of the season when we are playing every few days. I think we use up 75% of our energy in the first half and if we don’t get something out of it things become very complicated in the next half. We could see that Salad ran out of gas around between 50-60th min because in the first half he was constantly running up and down with Theo. Even Theo was out of gas and was trying to manage his runs.

As for the positives of the match, they were very few but still there.

Theo is truly becoming world class, his defensive game has improved a lot, still deadly when he makes forward runs and his crosses from deep were good just that they were to Daniel and not to Ibra. When we have Ibra and a good LW Theo would turn out to be a game changer.

Kessie and Bennacer did their Job like they always do, Ben made some good long balls especially towards the end and Kjaer was as usual solid on his side.

Not sure why many were criticising Diaz, he was not that bad, yes he was trying to dribble through a lot but that’s his game, and his main job was to improve the link up play which he did. Interesting to see that he did not play wide left and instead remained central with Hakan which completely threw the opponents off initially especially because they cannot ignore the left because Theo could rip them apart any moment.

Sorry for the long post, had a lot running in my mind, would love to hear what you guys think.",ACMilan,Match analysis after yesterday’s match.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/j3qs42/match_analysis_after_yesterdays_match/,2020-10-02 16:19:36

haphazardwizardofoz,1601559227.0,j38ndp,0.0,1.0,"On 16th December 1899, Nottingham-born footballer Herbert Kiplin founded Italian giants AC Milan. “We will be a team of devils”, he said. “Our colors will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents”. 

Over the past few years now, AC Milan has been a shadow of its former self, having won the Serie A way back in 2011. It’s been 9 years now and the Rossoneri is still struggling to compete with Europe’s finest. 

At the forefront to change the fortunes of the fallen Italian giant is another giant - American investment management firm Elliott Management. Founded in 1977 by Paul Singer after borrowing $1.3 million from friends and family, the Elliott Corporation is now worth $35 billion.

Elliott Management has a kind of cult status in the investing world, with some calling it “the vulture fund”, and for good reason. A vulture fund is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. 

This is exactly the kind of situation in which Paul Singer and Elliott Management swooped in to take-over the Milan-based club. 

In April 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong acquired AC Milan for €740m from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s investment firm Fininvest, ending his two-decade-long tenure at the club. This acquisition was completed by Yonghong via Rossoneri Sports Investment Luxembourg, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created to acquire the Italian giants.  

Yonghong had big hopes for the club. Part of his strategy was to leverage the club’s massive Chinese fan base and reshape the financial and organizational structure of the club. To execute his vision, Yonghong borrowed loans worth almost €300m from Elliott Management with an interest rate of ~11%. 

A little over a year later in July 2018, Yonghong could not repay his debts losing around €500m in equity, effectively ending his brief stint at the club. Elliott swooped in, acquiring 99.93% of the stakes of AC Milan for €400m, half of what it was valued at just a few months earlier. 

**Milan 2.0**

Elliott had a clear strategy for the club - raise the value of the club by winning matches on the pitch, make revenue off it, and sell for a healthy return. Over the past decade, the club’s annual revenues have hovered around the €200m mark. 

For perspective, Juventus’ annual return for the 2018-19 season was €494m. This is €94m more than what Elliott bought the entire club for. To solve this problem, the hedge fund first injected a sum of €50m into AC Milan to shore up the club’s balance sheets.

Elliott also appointed former Arsenal Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis as AC Milan’s new Chief Executive. It also brought in two more important people to the club. Club legend Paolo Maldini was brought in as Technical Director and Italian businessman Paolo Scaroni was brought in as Chairman. 

To scout players, former Arsenal executive, and LSE alumni Henrik Almstadt was tasked with identifying transfers. So was former AS Monaco head scout Geoffrey Moncada. 

Another company that played a part in the Milan takeover by Elliott Management is the private investment group, Blue Skye. Founded by Napoli-based businessmen Salvatore Cerchione and Gianluca D'Avanzo, the two are board members at the Rossoneri, with D’Avanzo the Chief Financial Officer of the club. 

Both founders have had a long-standing relationship with former AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. All three of them were on the board of SOPAF - a private equity firm that owned 50% of Blue Skye until 2006. They later sold these shares to another hedge fund DB Zwirn. 

On March 20, 2017, Blue Skye played its first part in the Li Hongyong takeover when it took control of the Luxembourg Investment Company - the entity that lent the money to Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux, Hongyong’s SPV. On April 4, 2017, the Luxembourg Investment Company changed its name to Project Redblack. 

On April 10, 2017, Blue Skye ceded control of Project Redblack to two SPVs owned by Elliott management, King George and Genio, in Delaware. Once Elliott gained control of AC Milan, Blue Skye was given a small piece of the AC Milan pie. 

**What now for Milan?**

For the 2018-19 season, the first under Elliott management, AC Milan suffered the worst result in the club’s history with its loss before tax amount increasing from €121m to €143m.

Unsurprisingly, this was also the worst in Serie A by some margin. For perspective, Inter had a total pre-loss amount of €40m and champions Juventus with €27m. The highest profit margin was reported by Atalanta who made €35m while also qualifying for the Champions League. 

One of the reasons for Milan’s poor numbers is the steep decline in profit on player sales - with the number falling a whopping €23m from €35m to €12m. For perspective, Juventus generated profits worth almost 10x more with €127m. 

In general, Milan has struggled with earning profits on player sales earning an average of €11m profit a year since 2014. In the same time period, Juventus have made a profit of €417m, Roma €391m, and Inter €185m. 

Despite Milan’s revenue rising 4% from €220m to €228m, it’s still less than half of Juventus who reported revenues worth €494m and €150m less than Inter’s €370m. They are ahead of Napoli though, who reported revenues worth €207m. 

However, things might be turning around for AC Milan. For instance, in the season recently completed (2019-20), Milan reduced their losses from €143m to €100m. Of these losses, €20m is directly attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Unlike other clubs in Serie A, the Rossoneri have no debt on the bond markets or from banks. For comparison, Juventus, Inter, and AS Roma have taken credits or issued bonds worth over €300m. 

This means that Milan is not answerable to any external investors or institutions. Its assets can also be easily liquidated as 100% of its shares can be sold for cash. Add to that its zero-debt, and Milan certainly appears a promising prospect for investors and sponsors. 

Plus the Zlatan effect isn’t too bad either 

Could the Elliott formula be working?

lorenzo013,1601508737.0,j2xapc,45.0,1.0,"I know, I should be very cautious with my optimism. But everything is falling together so perfect. Firstly the return of one of my favorite Milan players ever in Ibrahimovic and him being one of the leading players of our team. Secondly our most iconic player ever Paolo Maldini doing absolute magic in the last 2 transfer windows. And thirdly, our team is just so full of talent, players like Bennacer, Theo, Gigi, Romagnoli, leao, Tonali, Kessie, they all have that something special. It’s truly a joy to see all these players perform and to see them proud of being Milan player. 

also I would like to shine a light on two players, two players that have been HEAVLY criticised in the past, especially by me. But sometimes in life it feels really good to be proven wrong, this is one of those times. Of course I’m talking about Hakan en Kessie. Kessie for me has been nothing short of incredible, his composure and decision making have been out of this world. Hakan seems to have matured about 5 years in the space of 5 months, he has lead the team when Ibra wasn’t available and has flourished in his new role. 

Of course the team is far from perfect at this moment and lots of things need to become better, but gone are the days of Djamel Mesbah, Kevin constant, Poli, Bertolacci etc. For the first time in a very long time I’m feeling really optimistic. I would love to hear your opinions about our current team and the future of the club. The season is still very long, lets enjoy it together.

He would be absolutely mind blowing as a RW in our 4-2-3-1, as he is better defensively that Saalemakers and Samu and just as good if not better offensively. We tend to attack on the left and defend on the right under Pioli so as a RW, he can operate as a Wingback or winger in our formation. He has the speed, trickery, running in behind and crossing that complements Hakan and IBRA, and could come around 30 million considering he is only a wingback and Conte always demand the players he wants and ships them out instantly if they don’t work. I know we would have to buy him off inter, but serie A teams have dealt with each other before, and being a wingback, I doubt they haggle too much over sending him our way.

On the match: ""We had a very good game, we got distracted in that situation, it's a shame because the team kept the ball in the game, far from Milan compared to the first leg"".

On identity: ""The team spirit, the participation by everyone, we are happy with the work of the boys, a pity only for the result"".

On Tonali: ""He is part of a journey, we have faith in the boy, today he was decisive. He is a serious and intelligent boy, we are very happy with him"".

On Maradona's disappearance: ""We heard the news as soon as we landed, I join in the condolences, I offer condolences to the family. We are all united, he was a great champion"".

On the very low average age: ""We are happy we are young and exuberant guys, sometimes a bit of healthy madness is needed. It is a young Milan with some elements of experience like Kjaer who is giving us a very big hand. We are happy to have such a young team. ""

On Ibra's absence: ""He is too important a player, the group has always made up for his lack. The team spirit will always be the same, with or without Ibra"".

On Bennacer: ""He is giving a lot, he has grown a lot. I would not dwell on individuals, this team needs everyone, we are confident and we look to the future"".

On the next matches in the Europa League: ""We have to win the next ones and we think we can do it by playing like tonight"".

**Daniele Bonera was also interviewed by Milan TV at the end of Lille-Milan. These are his statements:**

On the result: ""There is regret for the result but great satisfaction for the performance. We managed to keep the ball in hand. This carelessness did not lead us to victory. The team in all its elements made a great performance "".

On Tonali: ""Sandro did well, he had some difficulties at the beginning in positioning. Then he grew up and also did the assist for Ante. We are happy with him, this is part of a growth process he is an intelligent guy and worker"".

On Castillejo: ""We are satisfied with Samu and his work in both phases, he must never miss this defensive contribution. His performance was crowned by a goal, we are happy"".

On the Europa League: ""In the Europa League the games are all difficult, a complicated group from the beginning. We played against a great team that had already shown us at San Siro. We are satisfied with the performance, beyond the result"".

On Kjaer: ""Simon is a certainty, he is exceptional. We can say the same about Gabbia. We are satisfied, when he was called into question he always performed very well. We are happy with the couple tonight"".

**Gigio Donnarumma was interviewed by Sky Sport in the post-match of Lille-Milan:**

On the match: ""We could have won, we conceded a very avoidable goal, I'm a bit bitter but the important thing is not to lose. We have two other finals, we decide our fate.""

On the absence of Zlatan: ""Ibra is a champion, he gives us a great hand, but all those who take over are good players and deserve to play for Milan. They will give everything so as not to miss him.""

On the wing: ""It is a pride to be AC ​​Milan captain, but the armband belongs to Alessio, I will probably give it to him on Sunday. The armband gives something more.""

On Maradona's disappearance: ""That's all, it's football. As soon as we landed there was this bad news, it upset me. A hug to all his family"".

**Sandro Tonali was interviewed by Sky Sport in the Lille-Milan postgame.**

On the draw: ""We deservedly took the lead, we didn't dominate it but we held the ball well, so we are sorry for the result.""

On the absence of Zlatan: ""Ibra helps and help his qualities and his plays. Playing with a champion like him is always easier but today we have shown that we can play as a great team even without him"".

**Tonali was also interviewed by Milan TV in the Lille-Milan postgame.**

On the action of the goal: ""The coach asks us to play forward, it's the first thing you have to do when you have space. You have to play more relaxed, it's something we already do in training.""

On the help of his teammates: ""They are all very strong players, they proved it last season and this year, they give me a lot every single training session. Any player helps those further back in their preparation.""

On Bonera on the bench: ""Bonera helped us and talked a lot, he asked us to play a great game and forget what happened in the first leg. We did it well for 80 minutes, we conceded the goal but we recovered"" .

On the calendar: ""We think one game at a time, we focus on the next match that has to come, as a great team.""


*****

**Samu Castillejo was interviewed by Sky Sport in the Lille-Milan postgame.**

On the return to scoring: ""It was important for me, I had a difficult start to the season, physical problems, a bit of everything has happened. Now I feel better and I want to continue like this.""

On Ibrahimovic: ""He helps us a lot, he's a champion. With him on the pitch he gives himself more and more, but without him we have to do even better.""

Samu Castillejo was also interviewed by Milan TV in the Pierre Mauroy postgame.

On the game: ""Too bad for that distraction that in the end doesn't make us bring the three points home, but we controlled the game from start to finish. I'm happy with how we played and the character we showed.""

On physical problems: ""I'm happy to be back to play without pain, the start of the season was heavy for me, I'm also happy for the goal and for helping the team.""

The_HomoSaurus_Rex,1606316088.0,k0tkh7,19.0,1.0,"Not an expert, however.

Would a 4222 be a good formation to face Lille? And even be used to stop strong midfields? 

Specially if Zlatan is out or when he's gone. 

Donnaruma

Calabria Kjaer Roma Theo

        Bennacer Kessie 

 Tonali/Çala/Brahim       Çala/Brahim/Krunic
        
 Rebić/Hauge/Salesman or Rebic/Leao( fit)/Hauge


Sub: Brahim, Colombo, Dalot??

This could help lock down the midfield by having Kessie murder anyone coming through and Bennacer sitting back to pluck any leaks. But this would only be necessary because Tonali and even Çala can begin to do that even earlier. 

Tonali and Çala have the freedom to press (which can allow a high line), create and attack, Tonali could POTENTIALLY improve in this scenario. 

Would free up Theo and Calabria even more to join the attack because having Kjaer, Bennacer, Kessie anf Roma to protect the rear at all times. 

Çala, Hauge, Rebic could just flow all over the place upfront, making the team very unpredictable and simply overloading the left nonstop.

Brahim and Colombo can come in if things are going well in the 60-65 min to reform our now traditional 4231 by taking out Çala and Hauge.  Rebic can go on the left again,  Brahim can move to the right, Colombo up front, Brahim sitting behind him. And Benna/Tonali/Kessie double.
Even Dalot can replace Theo/Calabria to give some rest and get more minutes. 


This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now.

I'm curious to see what ya'll think and if a tactic like this one could be utilized even if needing some adjustments.

GianniRivera10,1605967572.0,jyb9xw,5.0,1.0,"**There are a few certain nationalities AC Milan and its fans always had an affinity for.** The examples are rather obvious: we cannot start this without mentioning the **Dutch** first - thanks to the legendary trio of Gullit, Rijkaard and Van Basten who were central in Sacchi's extraordinary revolution towards modern football or later Clarence Seedorf (unless Bogarde, Esajas or van Ginkel enchanted your fantasy); then there has been the evergreen **Brazilian** flair and joy of Kaka, Leonardo, Ronaldinho, Pato or Ronaldo (while your grandpas might have loved Jose 'Mazzola' Altafini or Dino Sani) or the **Swedes** \- once again a legendary trio: Gren - Nordahl - Liedholm whose Blågult story is kept alive thanks to Ibrahimovic's second reign in red and black and hopefully by Roback in the future (inget tryck, Emil). But today, we're travelling a bit to the south of the Netherlands, in Belgium, a country famous for its great offer of culinary indulgence: fries, chocolate and beer as well as one of the biggest electronic music festivals in the world, Tomorrowland.

**Today, the Red Devils (Rode Duivels/Diables Rouges/Roten Teufels, as the Kingdom of Belgium is officially trilingual, although German is the first language only for 1% of Belgians) are represented by the young right side player Alexis Saelemaekers in rossonero**. There have not been many players from Belgium under contract with Milan throughout history. [5, to be more exact](https://www.transfermarkt.nl/ac-milan/gastarbeiterDetails/verein/5/land_id/19). Or 6, if you want to include Croatian-born Belgian naturalised **Dražen Brnčić**, famous for being the exchange player in the deal with Inter who brought Pirlo to AC Milan. **You could say that the biggest name was** [**Eric Gerets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gerets) (Belgium captain at the 1982 World Cup and PSV Eindhoven legend, winning one European Cup and 6 Dutch league titles in North Brabant), who only played a season for us in 1982/83. **To find other Belgians playing for AC Milan, we have to travel back to 1910 and there we find another trio hailing from Union Saint Gilloise:** [Max Tobias](http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Tobias.html) (who eventually became a captain at the club in the season he spent in Italy), [Louis van Hege](https://imgur.com/a/byUPRww) and **Roger Pierard** (who after a handful of friendly matches would return to his motherland).

**Louis Van Hege, or the 'Pale Lightning' remains to this day the only player in AC Milan who boasts a ratio higher than 1 in terms of goals/matches. In 92 matches played between 1910 and 1917, the Uccle-born player scored 98 goals (of which only allegedly 5 were penalties).** T[his record places the Belgian on the 11th position in the all-time top scorer standings](http://www.magliarossonera.it/statistiche/allTimeScorers.php) in the history of Milan Foot Ball Club, as it was called back then. Above players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Daniele Massaro, Ruud Gullit or George Weah.

**Born on the 8th of May 1886**, in Uccle, a suburb of the capital city of Brussels, van Hege plays for Union Saint-Gilloise between 1906 and 1910, not really stading out in terms of numbers, scoring 15 goals in 42 matches. However, he still attracted attention from outside Belgium. During a friendly match between Milan and Union SG ([won 2-0 by the Belgians, who displayed a fantastic team performance characterised by speed, precision and strength](http://www.magliarossonera.it/img190910/immamichev/0910_12a.html)) in the March of 1910 at the Arena Civica, he amazes the president of the club back then, [**Piero Pirelli**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/i9keru/facce_da_milan_piero_pirelli_orthe_tire_tread/) who does everything in his powers and gifts van Hege a workplace in the homonymous enterprise and a starting XI place in his club. Soon enough, Luigi, as van Hege presented himself to the Italian press of the time, would take calcio by storm. **As his nickname might have already suggested, van Hege was something never seen before in Italy. Because of his very clear complexion and his lightning fast dribbling, he was different from all the other players seen in Italy**: they were good dribblers but at slow speed or when stopped, while he was able to dribble his opponents at high speed, without stopping the ball.

**A symbol of the period, it was mainly thanks to him that Milan managed to be always very competitive in those years**. Implacable as a scorer, Luigi was extremely intelligent and understood perfectly when it was time to put himself at the service of the team, attracting the attention of the opposing defenders and letting his teammates come to conclusions thanks to the precision of his hold-up play and his assists. Emilio Colombo praised him on the columns of Lo Sport Illustrato: ""*Louis has very fine technique in the art of hitting the ball from any position, who does not lack muscles (180cm tall), is powerful and has great shot power. He uses both feet with the same confidence. He's a lightning bolt from stationary and running. He does not disdain shooting from long distance, by surprise.*""

**Thanks to his complete set of abilities, van Hege manages to rack the 98 goals mentioned earlier in his 7 years with AC Milan**. However, it has to be mentioned that the 1915-1916 and 1916-1917 were virtually non-existent due to the outbreak of the First World War: van Hege only played 3 matches in 2 years, scoring once. So practically, between 1910 and 1915, **Luigi scored at least 17 goals in each of the seasons**, on 4 out of 5 occasions scoring more goals than matches played. Moreover, in the entire history of AC Milan, out of the 8 times there has been a Milan player [scoring 5 goals in a match, four of these belong to our Pale Lightning, one of them in a 8-1 victory against Juventus as well as in the biggest ever win in the history of the club, 13-0 against Audax Modena.](http://www.magliarossonera.it/statistiche/detailMarcatureMultiple.php?comp=0&amp;scored=5&amp;pid=76) In terms of multiple scoring in a match, van Hege managed to score 4 goals three times, while he is on par with Marco van Basten when it comes to hat-tricks (7), behind Nordahl (14 hat-tricks), [his team-mate Aldo Cevenini](http://www.magliarossonera.it/statistiche/schedaGiocatore.php?pid=462) and Jose Altafini (8).

**In 1915, after a 'referendum' organised by Gazzetta dello Sport, the Belgian is elected as the most popular player in the league**. However, Europe is already in the middle of war and one year later, the most devastating event cuts short his footballing career in Italy. Thousands of men have been called to fight for their country and even the world of football cannot be exempted. 

Gazzetta dello Sport writes: *The talented Belgian football player, known and appreciated by all Italian football fans, leaves for Lyon, where he will undergo a final military visit and then join the small and valiant Belgian army operating in the Yser area. Called only in these days to serve, the strong and loyal sportsman leaves without delay or hesitation, leaving behind a crowd of admirers and friends who accompany him with the most sincere wish on his return to his still free homeland.*

*From our pitches disappears \[...\]* [the most beautiful footballer](https://imgur.com/a/l3eO5tu) *among the circle of national and foreign ""classics"" who have spent ten years here on the grounds of a hundred Italian cities. And it is a great loss for the national sport because the local elements, especially the young people, still had a lot to learn from Van Hege's class.*

One of the most significant players and captains in the history of AC Milan is called to arms and is forced to temporarily greet his teammates at Trotter. He joins the [Front Wanderers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPk4LNJ5y7w&amp;feature=emb_title)**, Belgium's military national team of football**. In those times, football was one if not the only entertainment soldiers had and every regiment had its own football team. He returned, during the hard years of war, to Italy a few times to dispute some friendly charity matches in favour of the families of the victims.

Two years after the end of WWI, in 1920, he debuts with a goal for Belgium against England Amateurs in a 3-1 victory. **The 31 year old van Hege is called up for the national team of Belgium at the Olympic Games held in Antwerp**, in his homeland. **Belgium wins the gold medal** and this would be the first honour won by Van Hege since 1910 in his Union Saint Gilloise times, his hometown club which he rejoined after leaving Italy. Today, a number of observers would like to give the Red Devils an honorary star on their jersey, following the example of Uruguay, whose jersey was allowed to have two extra stars by FIFA, to mark the 1924 and 1928 wins. Unfortunately, however, FIFA did not agree.

After amazing Italian football and Milan fans, he gets his last official cap for Belgium is in the 8-1 defeat against Sweden (the disaster of Colombes) at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. However, van Hege and Belgium played and won the revenge game (5-0), after which he found the time to retire and leave his place in the national team and his club to the younger generation. **Van Hege retires at the age of 35, after 132 matches and 34 goals for Union SG (where he played as a winger and as a midfielder from 1922 on) and 98 goals in 92 matches for Milan as a striker.**

**8 years after his retirement from football, van Hege returns to the Olympic Games**, not the summer ones though. Him and Max Houben represent Belgium at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid in the two-man bobsleigh competition, in which they finished ninth. Later on he remained associated with his Union Saint-Gilloise. From 1952 to 1963 he was vice-chairman of the club. 

**van Hege passed away in his native Ukkel at the age of 86, on the 24th of June 1975. Perhaps the only price Van Hege pays to date is simply that of having been a champion in an ancestral Milan, but not for this reason forgotten.

VesuvianBlack,1605511481.0,jv2p5c,18.0,14.0,"I'm sure all of us agree that Samu Castillejo has struggled to lay claim to a permanent spot on the right wing for the entire duration of the time he's been at San Siro. Right now, we have Saelemakers to play on the right as well but he's a solid, if not spectacular, utility option at best. So ideally, Samu should be sold the next summer transfer window if not January IMO. In that case who should Maldini and Massara target? 

We were linked to Domenico Berardi a few seasons back but his injury troubles so we never went through with it. 

We were linked to David Neres in 2018 and he would have been a massive upgrade over Samu with his Brazilian speed and flair combined with Ajax honed technical ability and decision making. 

Victor Tsygankov has been a bona fide star in the making for both Dynamo Kyiv and Ukraine with his ability on and off the ball. And I'm sure most Milan fans still hold fond memories of another Ukrainian talent lighting up the San Siro at the turn of the century. 

Calvin Stengs has become an important fixture on the flanks in a well rounded AZ Alkmaar side which has seen another upturn in its fortunes under Arne Slot during the last couple of seasons. 


These four are just players who I listed off the top of my mind. I welcome discussion about these four and  any other potential targets fans may have in mind.

I remember running from the bus stop home to watch the game with my grandpa (US time was like at 3:30 PM lol).

I lost my grandpa 4 years ago from the day and always think about this game when I think of happy moments with him. I suppose it's what makes sports so special for all of us.

I hope that everything is ok. I am currently a student in Milano doing my P.h.D. in Psychology. Furthermore, I am a Rossoneri in my heart for almost 20 years now (you can imagine that I am living the dream because I am living in Milano right now).

My data collection is not going well and I really need some participants. Furthermore, some of the items are pretty interesting and could help you dealing with the quarantine boredom (if it is present). So it's basically a win/win. My study contains a set of moral dilemmas that you provide answers to. It is quite interesting and maybe could help you learn a little bit about yourself.

**The questionnaire is for Italian speakers only.** This is an exploratory study and it would require approximately 40 minutes of your time. If you are interested you can check out the link below:

georgedavidrs,1604987552.0,jrfhnt,57.0,1.0,"Considering it's the international break and we have time to reflect,  i'm really interested to see what moves you think we should make during the winter window. My list is following the logic that we somewhat keep up the pace and are through the EL groups, and competing for at least top 4-5. 

For me it's the following: 

Incoming: 

1) Thauvin- absolute priority imo, cheap and such a huge stepup from Casti. 5-8m

2) Ibra Sub- Wouldn't mind a Llorente type of striker, &lt;3-4m

3) Theo Sub- I like Dalot but if we are to sell Conti, he should play on the right exclusively, loan deal would be good for a LB.

4) CB- Siamakan would be  a great move, alternatively Kabak or another young CB- 15-20m

Outgoing:

1) Samu- Honestly, he just has to go. For his own career to grow, he needs a different type of team. Ideally a swap deal with Thauvin

2) Kalulu- Loan him to a Spezia type team

3) Conti- there's simply no place currently for him, he should go to a mid-table team to play

4) Krunic- Most likely won't happen but a step up from Krunic would be good

5) Musacchio- He'll be leaving anyways, might as well get rid of his contract",ACMilan,Your ideal winter transfer market,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jrfhnt/your_ideal_winter_transfer_market/,2020-11-10 13:52:32

Aniket_1992,1604758465.0,jpri5v,14.0,1.0,"All I saw were reactions and counter reactions but no analysis, if there were then they got lost among the countless reactions and bashing.

Few points that I observed.

1. The Starting line up messed it all up.

By starting line up I mean mostly Samu and Krunic, the first half was actually the one where we were stronger, especially in midfield where Kessie and Tonali both were decent and had enough energy to break their press which was really physical and tough but when the ball went to Krunic or Samu the attack simply died and I think that is a bigger crime than what many people are making it out to be because as a winger if you don’t create goal scoring opportunity and waste a ball that is given to you then you have wasted the VERY precious energy that your midfield has spent in recovering the ball, running and beating the press especially Kessie who is already overused.

2. The soft penalty made it even worse.

Pioli realised his mistake a bit too late and starting a half already 1-0 down means to win you have to spend atleast double the energy in the first half and with Kessie already tired we started losing midfield battles and Lille started to dominate us. I was really upset with Pioli this time because this is the second time that he made the same mistake which almost cost us the qualification. The match against Rio Ave was the first one where he started with Krunic and Samu, messed up a half and the second half became really tough for us but since they were much inferior side we were somehow able to catch up. I understand playing Samu to an extent as we are not choosing Diaz on the right but what is the need to play Krunic when we have Hauge/Rebic/Leao?

3. Defence was actually very good contrary to the scoreline.

I think the recent backlash against Romagnoli is not because of him playing badly but Kjaer performing at a world class level. The guy is a monster, 99% of the times he will come out on top in a duel, Lille just made one counter where they caught us and scored a goal but the other 2 goals were purely lucky, one was a howler the other was a soft penalty.

4. Renato Sanches masterclass.

I think he was instrumental in Lille’s victory, and with Kessie not at his 100% and Tonali still adapting to two man midfield he totally dominated. He just brushed Diaz aside when on the ball. I would really like him to play in a Milan shirt because he can really fill the void in the midfield in situations like this.

5. Bennacer entry was too late.

Second half should have started with Kessie subbed out and Bennacer coming in with both the wingers also subbed out. Bennacer is good in beating the press and delivering killer balls, with our attack now possessing more goal scoring threat with Leao and Hakan we could have mounted more pressure on Lille with only 1 goal down.

Would like to know what others think about the game and where we made the mistake. I think this was definitely the game we could have won if we prepared it right and I will blame Pioli, however I won’t write him off as obviously we are leagues better than what we were last year around this time, but making the same mistake twice is kind of a bummer and I hope not to see Krunic and Samu again together on the pitch.",ACMilan,Can we have a good analysis on the match against Lille?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jpri5v/can_we_have_a_good_analysis_on_the_match_against/,2020-11-07 22:14:25

ElectricFrankie,1604694061.0,jpcm48,47.0,2.0,"Mods if you wanna take this down go ahead but I just wanted to say the following from my heart and what we’ve seen throughout the years from Romagnoli.

People are quickly turning on Romagnoli calling “prime bonera at best,” “he’s always been an above average defender,” “he’s too slow and can’t keep up with the players like Lukaku,” “he never wins aerial duels,” and etc. 

Let me tell you why this is all nonsense, and why Romagnoli is actually a great CB with great qualities. 

1. His rating has been an average of near 7 every season for Milan except last one (6.5 and that’s understandable because we were getting rammed in the first half of the season. So a 6.5 is a good rating all in all). 

2. His passing success percentage is an average of 90-92%, and one Romagnoli’s strengths is his vision and long passes. Throughout the years he’s made multiple passes to our fullbacks/wingers when upfront, and to obvious reasons, they’ve mostly been squandered. 

3. His pace is underrated. Lukaku was the fastest player on the Manchester United squad, and they have pacey players like Rashford, Martial, and etc. It’s understandable that he’s slower than Lukaku. 
Are we ignoring his run against Ronaldo where he came from behind and put in a perfectly timed tackle. Speaking of tackling.. 

4. His slide tackles are almost perfect. We’ve seen aggressiveness from him multiple times on the field when tackling from behind or sliding in. He’s had 3 red cards in his career with us, says a lot about his defensive IQ and how he wins these challenges. 

5. His marking is also good. In our 0-2 and 4-2 defeats against Inter, Lukaku had done nothing both games because Romagnoli marked him well. In our 0-2 defeat, Romagnoli lost the challenge for the ball in air fair and square and Lukaku scored. But that the was only time Lukaku got the best of him in the game inside the box. And in our 4-2 defeat, Lukaku got a final ball in the last minutes and scored, again, having done nothing all game because Romagnoli made it hard for him. Even in our 2-1 victory, Lukaku beat Romagnoli in sprinting forward, but every other instance with his back to Roma, Lukaku was forced to pass back or play sideways. And whenever Lukaku had faced Romagnoli head on, Romagnoli would win the back or tackle him. 

6. It’s obvious he’s not fully fit right now, and that these bad string of games are a result of that. He’s come back from injury and is getting his rhythm again. 

Pull up any highlight reel of Romagnoli, you’ll see him do the same thing over and over. People don’t understand how hard that is. And also even harder because of how many partners he’s had to play with. I will admit in the air Romagnoli can be better, but that’s about it from me.

The reason I used lukaku as prime example is because people are saying he’s been making a mockery out of Romagnoli and etc. I’m sure many teams would love to have Romagnoli with them, especially now that Milan is getting some buzz again, I’m sure he’ll step up soon as well. 

Romagnoli and Donnarumma are basically our only players that have been consistently good for us all these years. We can’t give up on Romagnoli like this and say the nonsense that’s being said on this subreddit and everywhere else.

Even though kessie has been playing for us for a long time now but he doesn’t have any ucl experince and playing in big matches . However, in my opinion luka to milan depends on certain things.

1. First and foremost is, if he wants to come to milan. He is 35, he could retire or go play at other easier league with higher salary, a more relax life. Not everyone is a warrior like zlatan and cristiano. It depends, what he wants to do with his career .  

2. If madrid wants to let him go. Zidane loves him, modrid loves zidane. Zidane made him into the next step. However, with valverde taking modrid’s plan in the first 11, and madrid’s bad track record of keeping old players or giving them a proper send off, i could see madrid not offering any more contract extension.

3. Lastly, depends on milan. Can we afford him? Isn’t better to get a younger player?

Just to note that Sergio Ramos age is 34 which would go against our policy to sign mostly young players. 

My opinion on this is that of course Ramos would never be a bad addition to any team, however I have a hard time to see that we are willing to bench either Romagnoli or Kjaer for Ramos given how the team is performing right now.

Aniket_1992,1604296893.0,jmi8hr,23.0,1.0,"I think its natural to worry if you see a player struggling but I think its being too much short sighted to write him off in just 2 games. Especially after the last one. I hope the below insight can reduce your worries a little.

What are the ideal characteristics that one looks for in an AMF?

High Priority: Passing, Vision, Creativity/Decision making
Medium Priority: Strength, Dribbling, Shooting

Hakan is a guy who ticks 3/3 in high priority attributes and 1/3 in Medium priority attributes and that 1 is for shooting. The major challenge for a player with Hakan’s characteristics is when he needs to create/play in dense places he lacks the required strength and dribbling. Udinese had a low block and left next to zero space between their mid and def which is the ideal position for Hakan during the game and that made things difficult.

On top of this Udinese have good physical players and their defence was actually playing good today, they completely neutralised Leao and Salad and the goals we scored were due to Zlatan who they just couldn’t find answer to. Zlatan is a player who is both physically and technically superior to them and Kessie had to attack the box to get the first goal for us. 

As for Hakan it was really difficult to create anything because they barely gave him any time on the ball, as a result he tried multiple things like going to the left wing switching with Leao and dropping to mid instead of standing between Udinese’s mid and def lines but that hampered his creating capability  because wings were already being neutralised and creating from center is already the job of Bennacer who was also struggling.

For people who are saying Brahim should start, just keep yourself in Pioli’s shoes and think, bringing in Diaz was a major gamble, yes Diaz has the ability to work in dense places unlike Hakan but since Udinese’s defence was so physical and strong that it could have backfired if Diaz kept getting dominated and pushed off the ball, kudos to Pioli for bringing him at a time when their stamina was dropping and introducing Tonali as well because Sandro brings the necessary physical presence in the midfield we started dominating the game.

Also the players tried to approach this intelligently, when teams have left virtually no space between their midfield and defence the best option to attack is to go for lob passes and long balls which takes out the entire defence and mid. Our players tried few lob passes but I think we need to improve on that aspect however it somehow paid off during the 2nd goal when Rebic tried it, their defence was getting tired and desperate due to our domination of the game and our God totally capitalised on the moment to give us the 3 points.

To conclude this game was meant for Hakan to struggle and required others to step up and these are going to be very crucial 3 points in the long run because everything in this match was meant for us to either draw or loose. Hope others can also share their insights.",ACMilan,For fans who are worried about Hakan.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/jmi8hr/for_fans_who_are_worried_about_hakan/,2020-11-02 14:01:33

Samkazi23,1608878382.0,kjun28,31.0,1.0,"What a year this has been. Many people actually looked that the finish to the last season and thought we couldnt replicate it.

But what the team has done; from the top hierarchy in terms of signings and contracts, to the Coach in his tactics and ensuring a competitive and loving spirit lives on, and to the players on their determination to lift us out of the banter era and return us to Europe, it has been nothing short of sensational.

In a long time we finally have, the best full backs in the league, we have argurably the best defensive duo, definitely the best midfield duo, best attacking midfielder, and the best striker in the league.

Sure we have had some difficulties, but we don't bow our heads and go out in a whimper anymore, we fight. And that is what we have missed in such a long time - that fight in us - that motivation that never ceases in every match.

Finally to the supporters, from the Curva Sud  to us, where we have formed quite a sizeable community, from the pessimists, to the realists to the optimists, one thing for sure is that we love Milan no matter the fall, we know we will get back up!

After being in pain for the better part of a decade, I'm happy with were we are. With this determination we are definitely coming back to Europe, and who knows what other bonuses may come out of it.

3lirex,1608795948.0,kjbbuv,28.0,1.0,"I've been thinking about possible Zlatan replacements, we've been hacing decent results without him but his presence is obviously missed, and rebic does much better as an LW so i think a back up is in order.

i have two ideas of relatively realistic players.

the first is olivier Giroud, he's tall, target man, finisher, can do a decent job as a back up and we can probably get him for cheap and it's probably not thaat difficult to get him. good back up but hes 34 and unlikely to be a permanent replacement

this one is my preferred option of the two, but more difficult and pricier. Wolfsburg's Wout Weghorst.
28 yr old, taller than Zlatan, has 9 goals 1 assist from 12 league games this season, and 13 goals overall, had 16 league goals and 20 overall previous season. pretty strong finisher and i think a good possible permanent replacement for Zlatan.
Downside is i think he'll cost around 40m, which is our transfer record i think, and he's Wolfsburg's main striker, i don't know how willing they are to let him go, and i think there is interest from Tottenham which could make it more difficult.

Obviously everyone's dream choice is Haaland but i don't think that's happening any time soon.

So, what do you think of my choices, and any other ideas ?",ACMilan,Possible Zlatan replacements,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kjbbuv/possible_zlatan_replacements/,2020-12-24 15:45:48

FIFA 21 PS4 Tournament (Region Europe, North Africa, Turkey)

First of all the region is because timezones and lag. I you're fine playing Brussels/Paris time. By all means join up.

Second, I've been organizing FIFA tournaments since 2015. Sadly our old community imploded, shortly after FIFA21, Long story involving Pro Clubs.

Anyway, I quit for a few months, but I'm ready to organise a new tournament or league (player participation has always been important)

So, if you're interested in playing a tournament and helping restart the old community. Please join.

As I just finished the Discord a few hours ago (and it's still not 100% finished, need to add some bots)

Hopefully Sandro comes back in time, but let's just assume he misses it, what formations would  you go with? 

&amp;#x200B;

There is the tactical dilemma of not fixing what isn't broken in terms of the formation, the 4-2-3-1, but i think against an overcrowded and physical Lazio midfield, we'd struggle with a Hakan-Krunic duo. I think a 4-4-2 might be the best solution, or even a 4-4-1-1. A lot also depends on if Rebic is healthy. I think this game will be very tough, and out of the ordinary due to our injuries, but we have  a 10 day break after this game so we gotta give it our all! 

Potential lineups:

**(4-2-3-1)**

Calha-Krunic

Casti-Diaz-Saele

Leao

**(4-4-2)**

Saele-Calha-Krunic-Diaz/Hauge

Leao-Rebic

**(4-4-1-1)**

Atalanta won't pay €15M for a crippled Caldara now. He wants to stay there. We could inflate a swap deal where both teams come out winners.

As far as Gomez and Hakan fitting into the same lineup, that's the kind of problem you want to have. As far as how two press exempt players (Ibra and Gomez) is too many, Pioli is getting paid to figure out alternatives.

I don't think Hakan and Gomez are as mutually exclusive as has been pointed out somewhere here already but there are some overlapping implications:

Gomez's big pay day won't be as high as Hakan's demands or ballpark/range (€4M+)?

Hakan won't sit on the bench of course but this Hakan at €4M is not a player anyone else wants to pay more for with a fee later. I can't fathom four more years of him being the main guy solely because of how much he's being paid (by which time we'd better be able to afford a better number 10 than him anyhow).

**The question I want to pose is thus:**

**If Gomez plays Hakan out of the lineup then what's the problem exactly? That he (Hakan) left for free? That he lowered his demands now that he had competition for minutes? That he's not a ""lifer"" at Milan?**

I see the argument against Gomez is that we'll make a loss on him, as if any money could be made from Hakan. I'd take Gomez if it meant Caldara is finally out of the team.

*""A win despite the absences. Maldini and Gazidis are listening (laughs). The technical area knows that if there are opportunities to improve the squad we will do it. Our group is compact and united. We will miss Kessié for the next match.""*

*""The technical area signed young players with personality. Our fans are always there. Those who say that the lack of public has helped us to grow and maybe they are also right, but now they would make us fly like Zlatan said. We want to satisfy them.""*

Berardi didn't get booked for consistently stimulating throughout the whole game trying to get Theo booked (he did get booked for a foul around 65' but that's not the point). We have seen some ridiculous bookings against our players. If we rightfully complain to the ref instead we get booked while they are injuring our players. I love the fact that as a team, management and fans don't really pay attention to refereeing as others do, but it's absurd and over the line when we lose players left and right from dumb decisions. I think Maldini should complain for once. I mean, we haven't watched the team full for more than 3 games this season with all the injuries and bookings. Sorry for long post, end of rant here.

HommoFroggy,1608203719.0,kevmaq,39.0,1.0,"The qualifying 3 matches of UEL are having an impact in this last matches. The fatigue is adding up and as Pioli said our players have to grit their teeth in this last 2 matches, lucky for us in the next 2 matches we have 2 very important peaces back who are Ibra and Theo and let’s hope that there is a chance for Kjaer in the last match vs Lazio to come back. 


Speaking about the 2nd half of the season.... i think that we should fully rotate the team in UEL and Coppa Italia. Players like Calhanoglu, Kessie, Bennacer and Kjaer especially should be rested in every single one of their matches, they have basically played every game while also being so important for their national teams. playing them outside of Serie A is a big No No for me. Fatigue adds up during the season both physically and mentally. Other players like: Calabria and Theo who spend to much energy can be evaluated and 1 match of UEL is played by one the other by the other one. Also an important  peace like Ibra has to be player smartly.... he is the seasons difference maker. It is very noticeable that most of the injuries we have are due to fatigue. Luckily for us none of the ones conceded till now is to serious so there is time to adapt. 


I don’t blame Pioli for how he has handled the rotation of UEL till now, cause it was the hardest group of UEL and we had to get out of it to not make a shit presentation like Inter did in UCL, while the group got complimented after that Lille loss of ours. We got out, now let’s handle the knock out stages differently. 


Again, we have to struggle in this last 2 matches, bring as many points home as possible and focus on Serie A and let’s gather as many points as possible. The picture is clear now after 12 matches, our starting lineup is strong enough to face any team in Serie A but at this moment of time in this particular season we can not handle 2 competitions at the same high level. Our team shows great spirit and character even in hard situations like the Hellas, Genoa or Parma ones even in matches without Ibra. We can all valuate how important is for us to have bright and not fatigued midfielders being that offensively but more importantly defensively. For Pioli during the brake that is coming shortly, he has to try to fix our set peaces defending cause we suffer at that. The rest is up to Maldini to think what is the best path to take for the future of our season.",ACMilan,Next day Match Discussion and Thoughts.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kevmaq/next_day_match_discussion_and_thoughts/,2020-12-17 19:15:19

Samkazi23,1607931914.0,kctafv,0.0,1.0,"Pioli spoke to the media after the game and despite his side’s spirited comeback – just like in the Hellas Verona game – he cannot see it all as positive.

“It remains an off night, as we are having some difficulties, especially Gabbia and Bennacer’s injuries,” he said (via Football Italia).

“As for the game, for the first time I’d say we didn’t have the right approach and were a little sluggish. Parma did very well on the counter, we could’ve equalised earlier and didn’t, but this is a team with heart and desire. It’s fine.

“Clearly, we wanted to win and we had the chances to do so. Parma had two shots on goal, but we also made mistakes on those two goals.

“We weren’t as sharp in the second half, but that can happen when you are putting so much spirit into the chase, throwing men into the box and trying to get it back on track.

“Parma deserve credit for making the most of their forwards, who have a lot of pace and are good at one-on-one situations. However, on the first goal, there’s clearly more of us in the box than Parma players, yet we got hunched up and didn’t cover the spaces.

“We had a lot of chances and should’ve scored earlier, it might’ve been a different game if we had, but it remains a genuine positive step forward in terms of mentality and character to get this back on track.”

Pioli was asked about whether his team are beginning to feel the affects of fatigue with such a rigorous schedule.

“I think the team is in good shape, both physically and mentally. I wouldn’t blame the Europa League, as I changed practically all the players on Thursday, so they can’t have been tired because of that.

“I don’t think we’ll have much time during the Christmas break to put some fuel in the tank in training, especially as we’ve got Juventus and Atalanta straight after the restart. It’ll be useful to rest more mentally than physically for a few days.”

Would Pioli sign on the dotted line if offered fourth place now?

“Milan haven’t been in the Champions League for a long time, it’s only right that the team is ambitious and proved it can fight it out with everyone, so we just have to continue like this. The only thing I would sign is a new contract!”

Kessie was interviewed by Sky Italia after the game, with his comments transcribed by MilanNews.

“We did not leave the pitch satisfied, it was a match that we had to win. In the end we fought until the end and we got the draw,” he said.

On his personal recent run of form: “A new coach has arrived, new players have also arrived. The coach was good at creating cohesion between us.

“I did everything to be here today, I never had the feeling of leaving, neither did the club. I’m here and I will stay here, I have a contract.”",ACMilan,"A.C.

gaeloftheassist,1607896876.0,kcju5h,35.0,1.0,"Seriously. It seems like every Milanista I ask this question outside of Italy considers Hakan as a great attacking midfielder. I don't think people understand that if you hit the post, it doesn't count as a goal, and you don't get a pat on the back for doing that. You can hit the post as many times as you like, believe me, it's not going to be a goal if doesn't go in the net. 

Just because he is the only midfielder in our team who hits the ball on target. That's literally his job... He doesn't move, he is static as fuck. He has a good game once in a blue moon. I saw him today walking on the field like a constipated child for most of the time. 

I am seriously pissed off how someone who plays as lethargic as he does wears the number 10 and is still managing to outlive managers we have had. Why is he still playing? Does he Gazidis's nudes that he's holding hostage?

And then a cherry on the cake, of course, WhoScored comes to put the metaphorical cherry on top of the shit pie of disbelief I am served. 

Would like to understand how others think. Insult me all you want, I just want some explanation to how this cunt has stayed on our payroll.

Samkazi23,1607294819.0,k83x6t,2.0,1.0,"**AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli has insisted that his team should celebrate a hard-fought three points against Sampdoria after a tough battle.**

Pioli took charge of his 50th game as Milan boss at the Marassi on Sunday night and racked up his 30th win in the process as his side saw off the hosts 2-1.

It was far from a classic despite the fact there were three goals. Milan went in at the break a goal up as Franck Kessie converted a penalty after a handball, while Samu Castillejo scored within two minutes of coming off the bench to double the advantage from Ante Rebic’s assist.

Although Albin Ekdal did pull a goal back from a corner, the Rossoneri would prove to have enough. The result means that Milan are five clear at the top again and seven points above Sassuolo in fifth place.

Pioli was interviewed by Sky Italia after the game, with his comments transcribed by MilanNews.

“I told them that we are a real team. The best quality of this group is that it uses all situations, even the negative ones, to prove their worth,” he said.

“It is the first time we have played without Kjaer, Bennacer and Ibra. They are three very important players. I congratulated them, we want to win every match, we know it won’t be possible, but we must have enthusiasm to face every single match.”

On the celebration after Castillejo’s goal: “Luckily they run faster than me. I thought we had closed the game, I made a mistake. Unfortunately, the goal conceded made it difficult for us.

“We live to give our best every day, it’s right to celebrate and rejoice. These matches are the most difficult, we came from the Europa League, we only prepared for the match yesterday. We are a target for many teams, it is right to be satisfied and that the boys take compliments.”

On the group: “Today we had a very young team on the pitch, the players continue to surprise me with my maturity. Let’s try to live this moment well, it’s useless to think too much about the past or the future, we must try to insist on situations that can give us advantages.”

On the absence of Ibra: “We all know how much Zlatan has made us grow, we hope to have him on the pitch as soon as possible, same goes for Kjaer. The more of us the better.”

On goals conceded: “We have to be more careful on set pieces, we suffer a little because we don’t have much height.”

On the comparison with City and Guardiola: “I would have preferred to have some more hair (laughs). We try to put our opponents in difficulty and find as many solutions as possible. Each opponent poses different difficulties, we have to face them with quality.”

On opponents in the league: “The strong teams are coming, they are there. We are on an exceptional path. Inter, Juve and Napoli are the best equipped teams. Inter and Juventus can be considered the favorites, as well as Napoli. We don’t have to think about this, keep working like this and keep growing.”

On the January transfer market: “I have a continuous relationship with the club, there is sharing of everything. I am focused on coaching this team, we have ample room for improvement, my goal is to make these players grow.

“Then if the club can, it will intervene in January, it’s a particular market. We have important games, we are focused on this.”",ACMilan,[Post Match Interview Thread],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/k83x6t/post_match_interview_thread/,2020-12-07 06:46:59

There is obviously a bit of an oversaturation here. I don't think we'll be able to provide equal game time to all left wing primaries. We will have to make a choice. Ideal solution would be playing Rebic or Leao as CFs but in practice it didn't work out. I think it is about time we say goodbye to one of these players. In that case I'd probably keep Rebic and Hauge and let Leao go. 

But I also think we could give Leao a try on the right wing, considering Castillejo's not so great performance.

# Statistics

* After a 2-0 loss at defending champions Juventus, Bologna have now won only once across their last ten Serie A (SA) fixtures (D5, L4), with their gap to the relegation zone consequently just six points. There has also been a drop off in entertainment in their recent league matches with the last five averaging just 1.8 goals per game, as opposed to the 3.43 seen in their prior 14 (league average 3.10).
* The hosts will be happy to return to Dall'Ara, where they have gained four of their five SA wins this term (W4, D2, L3), losing just once over their last five outings here (W2, D2). Moreover, Bologna have failed to score here just once in the previous 16 competitive matches, netting 2+ goals in seven of 11 this term.
* The 'winter champions' AC Milan are enjoying their best start to a league campaign since the 2003/04 season (W13, D4, L2), netting 2+ goals in all 17 SA matches they didn’t lose. With their two losses this season coming against top five sides Atalanta and Juventus, and Milan unbeaten when a match favourite this season (W11, D4), Bologna could be in trouble here.
* The visitors also have had no fear on the road, and are comfortably the division’s best away side ahead of this round (W8, D1). Much of that has been down to them starting well, and subsequently leading at HT in all eight victories. Additionally, Milan have achieved a HT/FT double here in three of their last four H2H wins.
* **Players to watch:** Bologna’s main threat **Roberto Soriano** has scored four of his six league goals in the first half. Meanwhile, Milan top-scorer **Zlatan Ibrahimović** (12 goals) has found the net after the break in six of his seven league goal-scoring outings this term.
* **Hot stat:** Each of the last six H2Hs (any venue) have seen the same HT/FT result (MIL: W5, D1).",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 20,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/l7s1qh/rivalry_watch_matchday_20/,2021-01-29 21:05:23

Personally, I would prefer Krunic in that position. He probably won’t create much but his ability to retain possession, track back like Hakan and press effectively will be very useful against Bologna.

I don’t think Leão will release the ball at the right time in dangerous positions. Plus, I don’t count on his work rate to track back and fulfill his defensive duties.

I would prefer Rebic on the left to help Theo and solidify the left flank. I think he would be the most useful on the left but if he was chosen to play through the middle, Leão could deputize for him out wide.

I don’t have any faith in Danny Maldini to have a positive impact if he starts this match.

I bring to you a conundrum that is shaking me to my core.

Ante Rebic Strong Foot.

This has been bugging me for ages. I watch every AC Milan game. I love Ante Rebic. Ever since the world cup he has become one of my favorite players to watch. His tenacity and constant stamina throughout the game is a sight to behold, and I love it when he scores goals (Sadly not that many this year, but it seems it could be due to that crazy freak injury + covid and the fact that he is still recovering from that).

Every single website lists that his strong foot is his right foot. However, in all of the games I have seen him play in AC Milan this year he has been favoring his left foot, from dribbling to passing, to literally any part of soccer, he prefers his left foot this year. He is using it a lot more then his right foot, almost exclusively.

So, I started doing some research. I wanted to see if Rebic has shot any set pieces. Because this would let me see if he is a righty or a lefty.  He has only shot 2 penalties in his life, and I cannot find either of these penalties online.

I know being 2-footed is the MOST LIKELY case. All I want to know is if he prefers his right foot or his left foot? Its been confusing to me since I definitely thought he was a righty, but like I said, he 100% has been favoring his left foot in all the games this year.",ACMilan,The Mystery Of Ante Rebic Strong Foot,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/l5ewqk/the_mystery_of_ante_rebic_strong_foot/,2021-01-26 22:19:58
Hass_s,1611669196.0,l5eez5,0.0,1.0,"Despite this being only the third transfer window that we can say that Maldini oversaw. It is obvious to us all that he is trying to build a balanced squad where every player is useful while reducing the wage bill as well as the age of individuals available . 

Many plaudits have come to Paolo, with many successful signings like Theo, Bennacer , Saelemaekers, Kalulu and Kjaer, But we should also salute him for the players that had no role in the club anymore and how he moved them on while trying to gain as much as he could from them in fees . 

&amp;#x200B;

This window we've bid farewell to **Duarte , Conti and now Musacchio**.

 While last summer we moved on **Suso , Paqueta , Ricardo Rodriguez , Andre Silva, Gustavo Gomez , Lucas Biglia, Jack Bonavetura , Pepe Reina , Laxalt , Halilovic.** 

And last winter it was : **Suso , Piatek , Caldara , Borini** 

That's **17 players** that were weighing in on our wage bill with no or low impact on the field. 

Granted we would all have wished those transfers would have brought in more money, but you can't ask much for bench warmers on high wages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maldini with the help of Massara and Moncada are shaping up this squad to the image they see fit to carry us forward.

I think based on his stat of making good dribbling runs he should be a second choice to Bennacer and should start with Kessie/Tonali. Both Kessie and Tonali are ball winning kind of midfielders and they provide defensive cover rather than help in defence to attack transitions although Tonali’s long pass can help a bit.

Last match we messed up on transitions so much, we tried to transition through wings which were efficiently pressed by them where as through center we had no one to dribble past there lines which Bennacer usually does and even Brahim could have helped there.

[Ver Video de Goles de Marco Van Basten](https://www.facebook.com/102335985070947/videos/2864198403865429)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dni0tn1dj5d61.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0ab732119cfc813cab7ff66ae9d6f313330bb7

**Orígenes**  
Fue el menor de tres hijos de Leny y Joop van Basten. Su hermana se llama Carla y su hermano Stanley.

Debido a que su abuela materna tenía problemas para pronunciar el nombre de Marcel, se convirtió en Marco poco después de su nacimiento.

Cuando era joven vio a su amigo Jopie hundirse en el hielo en Maarssen. Hizo todo lo que pudo para ayudarlo, pero no pudo evitar que se ahogara.

**Fútbol**  
Comenzó a jugar en un equipo local cuando tenía seis años. Un año después, se trasladó a Utrecht y desde los nueve años jugó brevemente en el desconocido Elinkwijk.

Centro Delantero, jugaba como único punta o acompañado de otro delantero. En ocasiones también jugó de extremo derecho o media punta.

**Ajax de Amsterdam**  
Hizo su debut en el Ajax de Amsterdam con tan solo dieciséis años, equipo con el que conseguiría tres ligas y tres copas de Holanda y la Recopa de Europa de 1987.

**Selección nacional**  
Su brillante juego (fue máximo goleador de la liga holandesa en tres ocasiones) le llevó a jugar con la selección nacional de su país, con la que entre 1983 y 1993 marcaría 24 goles, uno de los cuales, frente a la selección de la Unión Soviética, permitió a Holanda conseguir el triunfo en la Eurocopa de 1988.

Dotado de una clase excepcional, van Basten era capaz de dar la vuelta a cualquier partido. Capaz de disparar desde cualquier sitio, con cualquier efecto, van Basten además de chutar sabía regatear, rematar de cabeza y jugar sin balón.

**Atletic Club Mílan**  
Fichado por el Mílan italiano en 1987, vivió sus mejores momentos como deportista en ese club, ganando tres títulos de la liga italiana (1988, 1992 y 1993), dos de Copa de Europa (1989 y 1990) dos de Supercopa de Europa (1990 y 1991) y dos de Copa Intercontinental (1989 y 1990). En el Mílan jugó un total de 147 partidos marcando 90 goles.

**Lesiones**  
Su carrera estuvo plagada de lesiones que amenazaron constantemente su continuidad en el fútbol. Su carrera acabó por una lesión de tobillo crónica que le obligó a retirarse en 1995, aunque jugó su último partido en 1993. Finalmente, aceptó la propuesta de bloquearse el tobillo para siempre uniéndoselo con el resto de la pierna. Ya no podía doblarlo o girarlo. Desde entonces no pudo correr, pero dejó de sentir dolor.

**Balón de Oro**  
En 1986 recibió la Bota de Oro (trofeo otorgado anualmente por la revista francesa France Football al máximo goleador de las competiciones de liga europeas) y en tres ocasiones (1988, 1989 y 1992) el Balón de Oro (título otorgado cada año por la misma publicación al mejor jugador europeo).

**Entrenador**  
En 2004, fue entrenador de la selección holandesa, que dirigió hasta junio de 2008 tras la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2006 y la Eurocopa 2008.

En julio de 2008, fue contratado por el Ajax Ámsterdam, que entrenó hasta final de dicha temporada. Además, dirigió a SC Heerenveen y AZ Alkmaar.

**Familia**  
El 21 de junio de 1993 se casó con Liesbeth van Capelleveen en Haarzuilens. En ese momento tenían dos hijas y después tuvieron un hijo. Vivieron en Badhoevedorp durante mucho tiempo, pero cuando se convirtió en entrenador del Ajax en 2008, decidieron mudarse a Amsterdam

Samkazi23,1611435732.0,l3kgmt,7.0,1.0,"Pioli spoke to Sky Italia after the game, with his comments transcribed by Football Italia.

“We had started well, put lots of players into attack. It’s disappointing the way we conceded the opener on a set play, then the second goal closed the game. We had time, but were unable to find a way back into the match,” he said.

“We could’ve done more, we knew that we had to defend more carefully and the marking was also not the best, but we could have intercepted the cross earlier too.

“Atalanta did better than us this evening, a defeat can happen against a strong team. It’s disappointing, the second goal, as we just lost belief after that.

“It’s a very competitive league, we know it’s difficult, but we are up there at the top and we want to have our say.”

Pioli was asked about how the team have lost big games at San Siro against Juventus and now against Atalanta, but he insisted it is nothing to worry about.

“I think defeats to Juventus and Atalanta are nothing to be ashamed of. There are very high levels everywhere, so Atalanta were physically superior, more intense, winning all the duels and the second balls too.

“It’s a tight thing when you reach this level. We will analyse the defeat, try to see where we can improve and focus on the next match.”

There were some eyebrows raised when Meite started as an attacking midfielder, an experiment that didn’t work as he was taken off at half-time.

“Atalanta are a very physical side and I felt that we needed another midfielder who could counter that element in that area of the pitch. I knew Brahim Diaz was on the bench and could come on to provide different characteristics in that role.”",ACMilan,AC Milan vs Atalanta | Post Match Interviews,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/l3kgmt/ac_milan_vs_atalanta_post_match_interviews/,2021-01-24 05:02:12

“I love hip hop and R&amp;B. Mostly American stuff: Migos, Travis Scott, 6ix9ine, Da Baby, Roddy Rich”

“I really like rapping and I think that when I finish my football career I could do that, in life.”

“For now it’s just a pastime: I trap, but I speak above all of my life, of the sacrifices to get here. I really admire Jay-Z for everything he has achieved in his career. And now that we are also connected thanks to Milan, maybe in the future I will be able to go directly to knock on his door and make him make a little more money with my songs.” (laughs)

*“Having such a low average age creates a good climate. Ever since I arrive at Milanello in the morning and have breakfast all together, we never stop laughing and joking. We don’t manage to go to many concerts, between training and matches, and it’s a shame.”*

*“I wish I had gone to London to see Drake, but I didn’t make it. In my free time, the best I can do is nap, call my family, watch a series on Netflix or play on the Playstation.”*

*“When we are in the locker room we take turns deciding what to listen to. For example there is Theo who has Spanish origins and always puts on reggaeton records. Daniel Maldini also introduced me to a little bit of Italian rap. I like Sfera Ebbasta very much.”*

*“We have in common the lifestyle, but above all the sense of rhythm. That’s why, before the match and training sessions, we always listen to hip hop: I don’t have a particular song, I change it often, but it’s something that gives us a little life and energy.”*

*“I have had great satisfactions from life, but when we start playing as a child we have to give up a lot, and we do it willingly. When I became a professional, in a great team like Milan, it was a huge satisfaction both for me and for my family, which comes from a difficult past.”*

Samkazi23,1611332068.0,l2qwey,5.0,1.0,"Our first half of the season comes to a close with a high-quality fixture, as the Rossoneri could see themselves top after 19 matchdays for the first time since 2010. AC Milan host Atalanta at San Siro on Saturday at 18:00 CET. To kick off the build-up to the Serie A matchday 19 clash, Stefano Pioli has spoken to the press. All of the coach's thoughts have been broadcasted live from Milanello on the AC Milan Official App and Milan TV.


ATALANTA

""It's really important that we are aware of our own quality and way of conducting ourselves on the pitch, and therefore approaching each game with conviction. We need to respect our opponents tomorrow; they're a really strong side and you can only give them praise - they just missed out on reaching a Champions League semi-final. We will need to play out own game and try to win. The fact that Atalanta haven't won in their last two games shows how difficult this league is. They will certainly play with all of their quality and we need to do the same. These are two teams that are high up in the table and will also be a physical battle.""


ONE GAME AT A TIME

""We're only thinking about tomorrow's game. When that is over, we'll shift our focus to Tuesday but, before then, we don't want to change our mentality. It will be a tough game but we have the quality to do well. In general, we're focusing on ourselves and we need to continue to consolidate and improve on what we are doing. There are a few things we need to look at from our perfomances. We had one of our best games in Cagliari; if we can replicate that technical intensity, we'll do better and better. There are seven teams in contention for Champions League football; many of them could win the Scudetto as much as they could finish outside the top four.""


PENALTIES AND POSTS

""We play attacking football and often get into the opposition penalty box; that's why we have had so many penalties but that's also why we've hit the post so much. I have a lot of respect for our referees, who are among the best in the world. We can only think about our games and our results. We're only focusing on that; other discussions on this topic don't concern me.""


INDIVIDUALS

""Calabria deserves a lot of praise for his own growth; last year, he never stopped believing in his own ability and, this year, he has earned my trust with his performances in games and training. He's a really intelligent player, rarely makes mistakes and reads the game well. You can't be dissatisfied with his performances and attitude. Díaz? His position is between the lines and he's a great dribbler. He can also come inside from the flanks but his best position is more central. Leão? He's thinking more about scoring and being more precise with his finishing. He has the quality to beat his man and to be decisive tomorrow. His growth has also come from his ability to play the full 90. Tomorrow's game will be a physical one and we'll need to run hard and be prepared to win duels.""


RETURING PLAYERS

""I'm really satisfied that Hernández is back and only missed one week of training. Dalot was a perfect replacement in Cagliari, but Theo has certain characteristics that can be really important for us tomorrow. I've seen a lot of happiness in Rebić and Krunić; they can't wait to get back to it and I think they'll be fully fit soon.""

THE NEW ARRIVALS

""Mandžukić has started well. He's got a really modern, European attitude and has already played in Italy. No problem, there's been a lot of positivity and determination in his arrival. He's come here in good shape; he might not have played in a while but he's hungry and determined; he's ready for a call-up tomorrow. He's also come in to play alongside Zlatan; I'm open to whatever solution for valid alternatives so that opponents find it harder to predict what we're going to do. Tomori has a lot of aggression and speed; my staff and I think highly of him. We'll need to get to know each other a bit better and he will also need to time to adjust to our way of playing.""

ALTERNATIVES UP TOP

""I spoke to Mario about his position on the pitch and I couldn't have expected a better response from him: playing where the team needs him. In 18 games, we have only had Ibrahimović, Rebic and Leão all fit on two or three occasions; the arrival of Mandžukić gives us extra possibilites to rotate. These are judgements that will be made game by game.""

THE TRANSFER WINDOW AND EXPECTATIONS

""I feel as though I have to thank the owners and board, who have been prepared to make this group even stronger, showing that they believe in this project. Our objectives haven't changed: win each game, be ambitious and finish in the top four.""

&amp;#x200B;

\# STATISTICS

&amp;#x200B;

* AC Milan have won five of their last six Serie A (SA) matches, and their most recent win (2-0 vs Cagliari) saw them take a three-point advantage at the top of the table. Curiously, Milan have scored 2.17 goals on average per-game this SA season but are the only side yet to score inside the 61st-75th minute period.
* Expect action as ten of Milan’s last 13 home competitive matches have seen over 2.5 match goals, although the hosts have kept two consecutive clean sheets at the San Siro for the first time in more than a year. They will be keen for another good start here considering they’ve won a joint-second league high of four home matches that saw them lead at HT.
* Two consecutive draws have slowed the momentum of Atalanta - the second most prolific SA team this season (2.28 goals per game) - right before this minor Lombardian derby. However, they are still unbeaten in 12 competitive matches since the end of November (W7, D5), netting over 2.5 goals in six of those seven wins.
* The visitors have lost just once on the road this SA campaign (W4, D4, L1), with all four draws arriving across their last five top-flight road trips (W1). Additionally, four of the last five H2Hs held here have also ended as a draw (W1), despite Atalanta conceding the opener inside the first 15 minutes in the last two.
* **Players to watch**: The eternal **Zlatan Ibrahimović** (ACM) has hit a brace in five SA matches this term, including the last at Cagliari. Atalanta’s main attacking threat will be **Luis Muriel** who’s netted eight goals across his last eight competitive matches, with four arriving beyond the hour mark.
* **Hot stat**: Milan have failed to score in four of the last six home H2Hs (D4, L2), winning just once across the last ten (all venues). Atalanta have not lost away at San Siro against Milan since 06/01/2014 (3-0; Kaka x2, Cristante).",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 19,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/l2obef/rivalry_watch_matchday_19/,2021-01-22 22:01:39

Samkazi23,1611172680.0,l1h336,7.0,1.0,"Soualiho Meité signed with AC Milan coming from Torino on loan with a buy-option. He made his debut against Cagliari. Today, he was presented to the media and these are his statements:

“A midfielder must know both defending and attacking. I like to play like that.” 

What group did you find here at Milan? 

“I immediately felt the compactness of the group, we talk a lot and I liked it a lot. In Cagliari, it was nice to enter the field.” 

The best moment in your career? 

“Milan are the strongest team I’ve played for. There are many champions, Ibra does amazing things at 40. I’m young and I have to do more and more.” 

On the chance to play for Milan: 

“Of course this is a great chance. Milan are a great team, if I do well I can change my career. These months will be very important.” 

What went wrong for you in your last few weeks with Torino? 

“At Torino things were not going well, we won little. From a mental point of view it was not easy.” 

On meeting Pioli: 

“I really like his way of playing. He wants us to always play forward, it’s important for a midfielder like me.” 

On his inspiration: 

“I like many midfielders. I watch the best players like Pirlo, Modric and Yaya Touré. I watch their videos to try to learn from them.” 

On the choice for the number 18: 

“When I started in the first team it was my first number, so I chose it again because it was good for me.”

On already knowing Kessié: 

“It is important to know someone like Franck who will help me fit in better.”

On the differences between Pioli and Giampaolo at Torino

“They have different ideas. I can’t say if one is better than the other, they have different ways of seeing things. I really like Pioli’s way of playing.”

On the help Meité can give to the team:

“I came here to help the team stay first in the standings. I want to do more and more, I have to work hard and help the group.” 

On similarities with Desailly: 

“I know him well being French like me. He has done great things, I have yet to write my story. Desailly is Desailly, Meité is Meitè.” 

The last player at Milan with similar hair style was Gullit… 

“I have never watched him play, but I know that he was great.” 

How do you feel in a 4-2-3-1: 

“I know my characteristics well. In this team everyone moves a lot and I like this a lot. I don’t know my teammates very well, but from the first training session I immediately felt comfortable. Football is like a language, if you understand it, then everything is alright.” 

When did you realise you can really join AC Milan? 

“It was before the league match. My agent called me and told me we had to talk with Maldini. From that moment on, I understood that I could get to Milan.”

What did you feel when you heard about Milan?

“I was very happy. Other clubs were looking for me, but when I heard about Milan’s interest I wanted to come here immediately.”

Dishanta_Patowary,1611165145.0,l1ecpe,33.0,1.0,"Hello guys! 
I wanted to discuss something with you people.  

I just heard the news that Inter is changing their crest (and maybe even their name) for better branding. After Juve changed theirs in 2017 this news didn't surprise me much. It appears Inter is also going to swap for a minimalistic design.

However what I am wondering is, could this become the new normal? 

Also, I've noticed that companies like Google, Wolkswagen etc have replaced 3D logos with 2D designs. So football clubs following a similar strategy might make sense as well, considering the business aspects of both.  

So what I'd like to know is this:

1. Has Juve benefitted largely after the crest changed? 

2. Is there any chance we might be doing the same in a few years? 

3. If it does benefit substantially and is better for the club, would you guys accept a potentially minimalistic crest?

Would really appreciate if people, who know a little about the business aspects of football, share their views.

Davide Calabria spoke to Milan TV and this is what he had to say:

“Where there is a need I play. I have always been a wild card in the youth sector as well. I started as a midfielder and then I moved to be full-back. I know how to move in multiple roles and this is a positive fact. You have to know how to move. with intelligence.”

On his way of being on the pitch:

“It’s the Milan style. From an early age you grow up with discipline, with respect for your teammates and opponents. You have to grow with respect but without fear of anyone.” 

On his rebirth and form: 

“Surely I had a bad year, both me and the team have suffered a lot. We let ourselves be discouraged but I realized that we had to work and roll up our sleeves.”

About his season and his offensive plays:

“At the start, Mister Pioli demanded a lot of attention to the defensive phase and the balance in that department considering Theo’s moves forward. This made me grow a lot and helped me a lot from a defensive point of view. Then I started to advance also considering the style of play of the team. I really like playing forward and having this freedom from the coach.”

On the fans’ support: 

“I am very happy because it is nice that they appreciate what I do. You always have to be focused always because there are few breaks. There was a lot of work behind it but the merits also go to the team.”

On the objectives for the season: 

“Seeing the numbers is something that stimulates me to try to limit the star of the opposing team. Trying to be decisive defensively makes me proud. This year there are not many opponents who have put me in difficulty but perhaps the most difficult moment was the first minutes as a midfielder.”

Do you talk about the dream of the Scudetto in the locker room? 

“The logo we wear on our chests shouldn’t make us afraid to say that word. We don’t talk about it much but it is obvious that we think about it a bit.”

On his passion for basketball: 

“I follow NBA highlights. . I am a huge fan of the Warriors and how the team was built. They have a similar path to AC Milan, of a gradual construction. I was there when Bryant came to Milanello but he was one of my idols for his work ethic. His death touched me a lot.”

On the young group: 

“We are living this moment very positively. It was born a little by chance, thanks to our daily work and we have seen that the potential we have combined with hard work leads to great results. There are teams better equipped than us but the spirit we have can take us until the end.” 

On the club being active in the mercato: 

“We really appreciate the club intervening in the transfer market because it is right that the squad is strengthened if there’s a chance. With new additions, we can endure the absences that we have in the group.”

Samkazi23,1611032292.0,l0cnu1,3.0,1.0,"The Rossoneri restored their lead atop the Serie A table to three points with a 2-0 win over Cagliari in Sardinia on Monday night.

Perhaps as we should have expected it was Zlatan Ibrahimovic who had the decisive say in the game as he scored either side of the interval to ensure that Milan will be top at the half way point of the season.

It meant that the Diavolo responded perfectly to Inter’s win over Juventus last night, restoring the lead at the top back to three points.

Pioli was interviewed by Sky Italia after the game and began by reflecting on another important victory.

“We think about giving our best every game, this is the season. I always ask my players for attention, we must all be ready, we were. We did a test of strength, we won deservedly,” he said (via MilanNews).

“I say thank you to the fans for their support, the team will do everything to give their best, we must continue to think that every match will be the most important. On Saturday we will have a very important match against Atalanta, then in April we will see the ranking.”

It seems as though Mario Mandzukic will be the next signing of January after Soualiho Meite’s arrival on Friday night, and Pioli essentially confirmed it.

“Ibra said he’ll take care of keeping him at bay. I’m happy, the club is ambitious, they want Milan to get back on top, Mandzukic’s arrival goes into this situation. Given the many commitments and critical issues of this season, we need many players. I also tell them that it is not the quantity of minutes but the quality.”

On Mandzukic and Ibra together: “The principles of the game count, we found a balance, we always play with two forwards, one central and one on the left. With Mario I haven’t talked about tactics yet. We need many players, there are a lot of match.

“It is inevitable that there will be changes, turnover. We need to take no risks. We pulled the neck of several players from September to December and we lost several through injury. I’m happy with the choices of the club, it’s ready to do it again if the opportunity arises.”

On Kalulu: “I’m very happy and satisfied, he plays with personality and strength, he’s another player who can give us satisfaction.”

Pioli made a change at the break as Kjaer made way for Pierre Kalulu, with several journalists reporting that the Dane was suffering from lower back pain.

“He wasn’t hurt, he has this annoyance that limits him a bit, better not risk other headaches. The more quality players we are, the more we will be able to field competitive teams,” Pioli said.

On the Scudetto: “Seven teams are very strong, all of them will fight to the end to win the Scudetto and get to the Champions League. We will fight to get into the top four, it’s a path that must give us confidence. Tonight we won by fighting, then quality is there.”",ACMilan,"Post Match Interviews | Cagliari vs Milan | Serie A TIM, 2020/2021",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/l0cnu1/post_match_interviews_cagliari_vs_milan_serie_a/,2021-01-19 12:58:12

Definitely if we win the Scudetto this year (I'm still very on the fence about the probability of that however).

However... Last time he was here, we were already on the brink of declining, but he - along with especially Thiago Silva - brought us back by dominating and scoring loads of goals on our way to the clubs first Scudetto in plus five years.

Then, almost a decade later, he comes back and brings us from the depths of hell all the way to the very top. Carrying the entire team on his shoulders both on- and off the field with his mentality, character, accountability, hold-up-play and goal-nose. Scoring in almost every single game at almost 40 years of age!

We've had some great, great players throughout our time, but if we win the Scudetto this year, I'll put him up there. He'll never touch the likes of Baresi and Maldini of course. And due to him playing here for limited years and not winning that much, it'll probably also be hard to put him in the tier just below with van Basten, Shevchenko, Kaka and the likes. Further back you can add Rivera, Nordahl etc. to that list.

But because he's meant SO much while here - and the fact that we probably would've had a hard time even qualifying for CL without him - I'm inclined to put him in the tier just below. Which is really pretty fucking insane considering he's been here for 3,5 years total only managing to win a single Scudetto and no Champions Leagues so far. One of the most talented strikers to ever don our beautiful shirt though. A character and the only superstar to star for us since the end of the 00's. Probably since Kaka's Ballon D'or Winning 2007 season to be honest.

TL;DR:

Zlatan managed to keep our beloved club relevant in the early years of the last decade, pushing the inevitable banter-era a few years ahead, and now he's returned to pull us back up from that very abyss the decision to offload him and Thiago Silva to PSG threw us into almost a decade ago. Certified, bonafide Milan legend.

* 21/01/2018: Cagliari 1-2 Milan (Barella 8' / Kessie pen. 36', 42')

# STATISTICS

*  Dangerously close to the Serie A relegation zone, Cagliari are winless in five home league outings (D2, L3). On a brighter note, the Sardinians have scored in each of their previous nine competitive home outings, claiming the opener before the break in three (HT: W2, L1) of the last four (FT: D1, L3).
* Overall, Cagliari have registered only 14 points in the opening 17 SA rounds (W3, D5, L9), which is their lowest such return since 2014/15, a season that saw them eventually relegated. Curiously, they had the same average of goals conceded at this stage back then (2.00).
* Netting 2+ goals in 16 of their 17 SA matches, AC Milan are enjoying their best start to a league campaign since the 2003/04 season, which saw them crowned champions by an 11-point margin, while averaging 1.91 goals per game. Currently averaging a better rate per SA game this term (2.18), they boast the third-longest consecutive scoring streak in top-flight history (37 games).
* The visitors have had no fear on the road, and are comfortably the division’s best away side ahead of this round (W7, D1). Much of that has been down to them starting well, and subsequently leading at HT in all seven victories. That said, a HT/FT double is something that Milan have achieved just once in the previous seven H2Hs held here (W3, D3, L1).
* **Players to watch**: Cagliari’s **João Pedro** remains his side’s top league scorer this term, with three of his last four goals arriving after the break. Scorer of a brace four times this SA season, all eyes will be on Milan’s **Zlatan Ibrahimović** as the club’s top league scorer (ten goals) is set to return to league action.
* **Hot stat**: Going back to the start of 2018/19, Milan have netted at least two goals in 40 (an 80% majority) of their last 50 league victories.",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 18,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kxtboq/rivalry_watch_matchday_18/,2021-01-15 20:09:46

Samkazi23,1610493447.0,kw3e7b,0.0,4.0,"*“We were a team for 120 minutes.""*


Stefano Pioli gave a brief interview to Rai Sport:

“The team knows how to fight, it knows how to play and grit its teeth. It was a complicated match, our opponents managed to dribble better than Saturday’s match. But especially in the second half we could have avoided extra time with the many opportunities we had. We were a team for the whole match, it’s a desired and deserved victory.”

On starting Ibrahimovic: “I spoke to him, we wanted to give him a longer time than the ten minutes played on Saturday. Due to his characteristics I think it is better to start from the beginning. He had a good race, these forty-five minutes will help him improve his condition and be at his best for the championship challenge.” 

On his serenity: “You can see that I’m fine here at Milan. I train a group of players who make me proud for the willingness they put into it every day. When you are happy and well it is easier for you to convey serenity and conviction. I know I coach a strong team, I have to point the right way and I try to do it in the best possible way.”

“Penalties are difficult to train on. Aside the fact of scoring penalties is the quality of my players and the mental aspect of trying to win games. Many times I have been asked what the turning point was, the one with Rio Ave was important.”

On Inter-Juve: “I hope to do well against Cagliari, then we will certainly watch it, just as it will watch the derby. Great teams face each other, I will watch them with great interest.”

**Stefano Pioli also spoke to Milan TV after the game against Torino in the Coppa Italia, these were his words:**

“I can only be satisfied with the performance of the boys. It was the fourth game in 9 days and there was no lack of spirit and intensity. It is a pity we did not win the game in the 90 minutes. We still showed quality because even scoring 5 penalties is not random.” 

“We believe in our qualities. We always think positively during matches. Staying in the game means being focused and believing in our abilities. This is proving us right because the matches are difficult and complicated.”

“Our youth sector has quality and it must be like this because we are Milan. It is a sector of perspective. It is good that when there is the possibility our young people will be ready.”

**Here are the statements made by the Turin coach, Marco Giampaolo, at the end of the match against Milan:**

*“The team did well, it was competitive. One hundred and twenty minutes is a lot, added to the three previous games. Then we play on Saturday, I don't like the calendar because there aren't the right recovery times. It was also a joke, because when you get to penalties you give yourself a chance. Competition is important and we have not snubbed it.""*

*""There is disappointment and we need to organize ourselves. I asked the team to play. We weren't dangerous up front but we helped with personality. Meité? He was not available tonight because I think he is leaving, then what will happen tomorrow I don't know.""*",ACMilan,Post Match Interview | AC Milan vs Torino | Coppa Italia,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kw3e7b/post_match_interview_ac_milan_vs_torino_coppa/,2021-01-13 07:17:27

Watched all games since Pioli arrived except one match. I know and see how well can play Theo and Rebic together when Rebic plays on LW position. But when Hague plays on RW Theo somehow always pass to someone else or dive in to the midfield. Feel like there is absolutely no chemistry between them.
I’m not sure why it is. Maybe Hague hugs more the line compare to Rebic who is positioning himself more to center giving more space to Theo run on the sideline instead of diving into middle.
It’s sad to watch because I “feel” like Theo just don’t want to Hague to explode in order to have chance to play more with Rebic. Maybe it’s sound crazy .. don’t know.

Samkazi23,1610272261.0,kubpxq,4.0,1.0,"Milan responded to the loss against Juventus in the best way possible, beating the Bianconeri’s city rivals Torino this evening by two goals to nil. An important win for Stefano Pioli’s side, especially mentally. 

The Rossoneri scored both of their goals in the first half and then defended for the rest of the game, focusing on counter-attacks instead. A wise tactic, seeing as Torino barely threatened even when they had time to build.

Rafael Leao got on the scoresheet first with a nice finished, assisted by Brahim Diaz after a lovely move. Franck Kessie then converted a penalty, which Diaz won. In an interview with DAZN, as cited by MilanNews, Pioli spoke about the performance.

On Leao: “He is an attacker, he can also play on the left but the important thing is that he continues to have intensity. He was inside the game, he must grow up but let’s not forget that he is a young boy.”

On the response: “I must say that I was not surprised, I was expecting this response. The team is young but strong. We played a very high-level first half, then in the second half, it was normal to manage and suffer a little. I am very satisfied with the performance of the boys.”

On injuries: “We still don’t know anything about Diaz and Tonali. I hope it is not a long time thing. I absolutely do not believe that Leao was a yellow card, never seen such a yellow card in the middle of the pitch.”

On Kessie: “Franck is becoming a player who does well in all phases, he gives us many things. It is continuous and clear growth, he is a strength of the team. It shows. He always has a very positive mentality, he is the first to help. On the pitch, these are very important behaviours, especially for a young team like ours that needs certainty.”

Who do you support tomorrow, Roma or Inter?

“Today we wanted to play well and win the game. We train in the morning and then enjoy the game. We like to see good matches, they are teams that play well with two quality players and two excellent coaches. This is not the time to look at the standings. In football, you just have to think about the next match. Now we’re back on the pitch on Tuesday.”

Again on Leao as the second striker: “I agree, now he’s becoming complete. We have so many possibilities. Calhanoglu and Diaz are giving us so many possibilities. Then we can also change our formation, we are open to many possibilities.”

On Ibra: “We spent the week with a clear schedule, he accepted it. Had he passed the last audition yesterday he would have been available for a small piece. Now he has to find a good condition, we have to understand how to manage it. As always, he is very helpful and collaborative, we will find the best solution.”

Samkazi23,1610122538.0,kt5mrh,4.0,1.0,"Wednesday’s game against Juventus is in the books for Stefano Pioli’s AC Milan with the Rossoneri ready to return to the San Siro pitch tomorrow night, 20:45 CET, for the first part of the double fixture against Torino. The coach held a press conference at Milanello on the eve of matchday 17 in Serie A. Here's what he had to say:

**AC MILAN V TORINO**

""They had a few problems at the start of the season but that's nomal as a new coach tries to implement his own style. Now, they're looking more confident and are playing with a bit more freedom. They have conviction and we need to respect them. They'll be highly motivated but so will we be; from that point of view, we're equals. The most determined team will deserve to win. I'm sure that my players will be determined and hungry to play well. If other issues arise, there will be a lot of absences but we're hoping to have a full squad for the Cagliari game. We need to grit our teeth now; we want to put in a convincing performance. We're concentrating and are feeling good. When other players come back, we'll have more choices to lighten the workload for some of the boys.""

**INJURIES**

""This season is long and complicated so you are going to get injuries. It's useless to waste your energy on things you can't control; it's better to focus on trying to find solutions and to think positively. The team is well and needs to go out and play tomorrow. The medical staff say Saelemaekers and Bennacer should be back for Cagliari and Ibrahimović is continuing his recovery process. He has worked a bit but I don't think he'll be available tomorrow. Kjær was a bit fatigued but did train today. Çalhanoğlu has hurt his ankle and couldn't train; we'll make a decision on him tomorrow.""

**THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE DRESSING ROOM**

""We feel strong. The boys are showing me each day in training that they never give up and believe in themselves. They're right to believe in themselves because results say we're a strong side but we need to keep up this level to remain strong. In April, the table will have opened up and we'll have a better idea of where we can finish.""


**AFTER AC MILAN V JUVENTUS**

""Wednesday's defeat was analysed in the same way we look at our victories. We look at the positives and the negatives but Maldini and I didn't need to intervene. We made a couple of mistakes for the first two goals, which our opponents took advantage of with their immense quality. We're working to try and improve in these situations, to mark better and double up on the right players, but mistakes are a part of any game. The level of your opposition also dictates how much you have to pay for these errors. The day after, most of the players asked me to go over the footage to see how they can do better; this makes you realise how hungry this team is to read the game and always improve.""

**INDIVIDUALS**

""Leão played really well on Wednesday. He put the defenders under constant pressure and played with a lot of intensity. He did the same against Benevento. He worked a lot for the team and he needs to expect this type of performance of himself. Calabria is an intelligent player; he used the first few minutes to get into a rhythm with the others but I think he did well after that. I got the response I wanted from him and another good performance. Hauge and Díaz have a lot of personality and have shown as much. They can put in winning performances; they have the ability to do that. They need to keep developing. We're the youngest team in Italy - and maybe even Europe - and we need to give the lads time to find a bit of balance. They have the right qualities to be big players.""

**TRANSFER MARKET, RENEWALS AND NEW PLAYERS**

""I share the same opinions as the technical area; we can't rush it. I think we'll do bits in the window but but only if there's the right opportunity to improve the squad. There is the desire, on the part of the owners, to continue renewing players as their contracts run out and I think there's a lot of hunger and positivity from both parties; that is what counts. For the most part, I'll speak about the players I am coaching at this moment in time.""",ACMilan,AC Milan vs. Torino | Serie A TIM 2020/2021| The Pre- Match Press Conference.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kt5mrh/ac_milan_vs_torino_serie_a_tim_20202021_the_pre/,2021-01-09 00:15:38

Ibraholic,1610118602.0,kt4abt,18.0,1.0,"I rarely see contents from L'Ultimo Uomo posted here, it's likely the best Italian website about football, with a lot of analysis and (almost) no quarrels (they never discuss referees for instance). I thought it would be interesting to share some bullet points for non-Italian speakers of the community.

* The match in a Nutshell: too many absences conditioned the result; Juventus won thanks to its superiority in individual duels (in particular Theo VS Chiesa and Romagnoli VS Dybala);
* Given the emergency with the absentees, Milan decided to play even a more extreme version of its football, with an incredibly aggressive pressing. This however obliged the team to leave a lot of space that Juventus could exploit as soon as they could get to the midfield;
* Final takeaway from the match according to the guys @ Ultimo Uomo: After 27 matches, Milan lost its first match, the most difficult of the season so far due to the strength of the opponents and the peculiar conditions (i.e. the number of absent players). It has been possibly too much of a peculiar game, and too conditioned by the absentees, to understand how much Milan can be a serious contender for the Scudetto - a fact that many wanted to understand with this game. However, even in this dire condition, Milan showed character, a clear identity and very solid ideas. Milan has reached a maturity which leaves a lot of hope for the future, regardless of how long the team will be able to remain on top of the league.

Samkazi23,1609929169.0,krldaq,2.0,1.0,"
*""Tick tock tick tock""* – **Zlatan Ibrahimovic knew exactly what he was doing with his latest social media post.**

The AC Milan striker was cheekily sending a message to his followers that he was in a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's massive Serie A showdown with Juventus.

However, the accompanying video of Ibrahimovic scoring in training did not just send fans into a frenzy.



Milan coach Stefano Pioli was also immediately bombarded with messages from giddy journalists asking if his best centre-forward could really be fit to face the champions.

In reality, while Ibrahimovic has almost fully recovered from the muscular problem which has sidelined him since November, he never had any hope of featuring at San Siro.

The widespread desire to see him play was understandable, of course.

This game was meant to be *'Zlatan versus Cristiano';* a battle between **two goalscoring phenomena who are defying the ageing process.**

Ronaldo, 35, has struck 14 times in just 11 Serie A appearances this season; even more incredibly, the 39-year-old Ibrahimovic had scored 10 goals in just six appearances before injury interrupted his campaign.

Still, while the Swede may remain out of action, Milan against Juventus remains all about their respective superstars. After all, the way in which the Rossoneri have coped without their talismanic attacker has underlined their title credentials.

As former Milan and Juve coach Carlo Ancelotti told the Gazzetta dello Sport on Tuesday, *""Ibra's absence was an exam that Milan have already passed with full marks.""*

Indeed, there were those that felt that when Ibrahimovic hobbled off with 11 minutes remaining in a 3-1 win at Napoli on November 22, the Rossoneri's hopes of sustaining a top-four finish would quickly collapse.

Instead, Milan have shown that while Ibra is their primary source of inspiration both on the pitch and in the dressing room, they have a squad of youngsters that are as tenacious as they are talented.

Those qualities were both on show on Sunday, when Milan overcame the loss of Sandro Tonali to a first-half red card to triumph 2-0 at Benevento.

Consequently, Milan have now accumulated 17 of a possible 21 points since losing Ibrahimovic to injury at the San Paolo.

**What is arguably even more remarkable is that the only unbeaten team left in any of Europe's 'Big Five' leagues have managed to maintain their remarkable scoring record.**

Pioli's players have racked up two or more goals in each of their last 17 games – the best run in Serie A history – with the likes of Rafael Leao coming into their own.

The net result is that Milan go into matchday 16 as Serie A leaders, and a whopping 10 points clear of defending champions Juve in fifth.

Andrea Pirlo's side have a game in hand, against fourth-placed Napoli, but never before have the Rossoneri held such a lead over their rivals during the first half of a season.

Wednesday's contest, then, represents a unique opportunity for Milan to strike a decisive blow to the Old Lady's hopes of a 10th successive Scudetto.

**It certainly cannot decide the title race – the Rossoneri are just one point ahead of Antonio Conte's resurgent Inter – but it could well eliminate the Bianconeri from the reckoning.**

In that sense, it is a far bigger game for Juve than Milan; the visitors really need to win to kickstart their campaign.

So, it is just as well that they will arrive in Milan with arguably the game's most reliable match-winner leading their line.

**Milan may have made do without Ibrahimovic, but Juve would arguably be lost without Ronaldo.**

The Portugal legend accounts for 48 per cent of the Bianconeri's Serie A goals this season (14/29). In addition, they drew all three of the games he has missed to date, against Crotone, Verona and Benevento.

Pirlo has unsurprisingly attempted to rationalise his team’s obvious reliance upon the five-time Ballon d’Or winner.

*“From the beginning we tried to exploit Ronaldo for his characteristics,”* he told reporters on Tuesday. *“We wanted to have him be decisive in the last few metres in front of goal.""*

*“He was decisive [at every club], though, so it’s normal that when you have a champion like him, you depend on him.”*

They will certainly need him to deliver at San Siro.

Milan may be missing Ibrahimovic, while Tonali’s suspension for his red card at Benevento has left Pioli desperately short on options in midfield, with Ismael Bennacer still unavailable through injury.

However, Theo Hernandez’s return is a colossal boost for the youngest squad in Europe's top leagues, given the former Real Madrid man is this season rivalling Andy Robertson for the title of the world’s best left-back.

It is even more significant when one considers that Juan Cuadrado – Juve’s first-choice right-back and one of their better players in 2020 – has contracted Covid-19 and is, therefore, ruled out for an unspecified period of time. The Bianconeri would have been banking on the Colombia international to have the pace and stamina to deal with Theo’s relentless marauding down the left flank.

Juve could yet have Alvaro Morata back up front, but Pirlo is pessimistic about the Spaniard’s chances of making the bench, let alone starting.

Paulo Dybala is instead expected to be paired with Ronaldo in attack, and the struggling Argentine will have been buoyed by his late goal in Sunday’s 4-1 win over Udinese.

Juve’s hopes of victory, though, will rest on Ronaldo, and he will know that they cannot squander this chance to derail Milan’s title charge.

The Rossoneri have coped wonderfully well without Ibrahimovic, but they will be even better when he returns.

Juve’s time to take advantage of his absence is clearly running out.

Samkazi23,1609882046.0,kr89he,6.0,1.0,"*Following their win against Benevento, the Rossoneri are preparing to make an immediate return to Serie A action. On 6 January, a highly significant San Siro showdown is scheduled for 20:45 CET: AC Milan v Juventus. Coach Pioli held a press conference at Milanello ahead of the clash. Here are his pre-match thoughts:*


**AC MILAN V JUVENTUS**

""I expect Juve to be much improved. They started off in a tough spot because they're a team in transition. They're still strong, with quality and experience, and are a very dangerous side. We'll be ready and will need to be tactically flexible. AC Milan v Juve is always a great game. It will be important but not decisive; there will be more obstacles for us than usual but we've shown we can compete with any team. It will be a big test and we'll need to raise our game and give it everything.""

**THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON AS AN EXAMPLE**

""The first half of the season showed us that games are never finished - you can always come back. I expect that the team has understood and benefited from this. So the win in July is in the past; it gave us confidence and conviction but tomorrow is what counts."" 


**THE TEAM**

""We've always done well to reach our short-term goals; our next aim is to give our all to win tomorrow. A draw? Playing for a draw is the easiest way to risk defeat, we're preparing to play to win. We're not looking at results elsewhere and the table isn't the most important thing right now. We believe we'll be fitter than we were against Benevento.""


**THE LEAGUE**

""We've been on a great run until now; nobody has done better than us but the league is still very open with a lot of strong teams, who all have the same objectives. We'll need to fight until the end to finish high in the table. We have to keep up the intensity and quality."" 

**PIOLI'S ON FIRE**

""I'm thankful to the Club for their support and to the players for their trust. I'm still neutral; I know that things can change quickly, so I'm even more ambitious to maintain this high standard. As a player, I joined Juve at a young age and learned a lot from various great players at the time. I left a more mature player.""  

**INDIVIDUALS**

""Ibrahimović is doing better but he's not available yet. Leão is growing a lot, showing that the youth needs time; he has a lot of quality and is always up for it. Conti is a great player and very reliable. The hierarchy has changed recently but nothing is set in stone. Krunić needs to give an account of his skills on the pitch; I won't say anything in particular to him, just to pay attention to those little details that can make the difference in these kinds of games.""    

**THE TRANSFER WINDOW**

""The Club is active every day and we are in constant communication. If there are any opportunities, we'll be ready to take them. We haven't put any players up for sale.""",ACMilan,AC Milan vs Juventus | Serie A 2020/2021 | Stefano Pioli's Pre Match Press Conference.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/kr89he/ac_milan_vs_juventus_serie_a_20202021_stefano/,2021-01-06 05:27:26

## Match Report

[Here's the Match Report from Lega Serie A](http://www.legaseriea.it/en/serie-a/match-report/2020-21/UNICO/UNI/15/BENMIL).

Samkazi23,1609783453.0,kqe1ro,23.0,1.0,"Milan look to France. Rossoneri are one of the most active teams. Not only for the current window but also for the June transfer market window.

Talks are progressing with RC Strasbourg for Mohamed Simakan. Maldini wants to close the deal for around €15M plus add-ons, but Strasbourg wants at least €20M. The dialogue will go on and there could be a closure soon. Milan is ready to give him a five-year contract for around €2M.

Also in France, Milan follows Koudadio Koné, the Toulouse midfielder. But for now, his club sets a value that is too high for Milan. The Rossoneri hope to conclude the deal for less that €10M, also because the midfielder plays in a Ligue 2 team. The negotiation will continue in the next few hours.

Not only movements for this market window. Milan are also moving for June and have not lost their contacts for Thauvin. The player has refused the renewal with Marseille and is waiting for a call from Maldini who communicated his real interest to Thauvin’s entourage already in September. The French earns €4M a year and AC Milan offers for around €3M. Let’s see in the coming days if the Rossoneri decide to speed up the negotiations. Thauvin has many other requests but Milan is one of his favourite destinations.

# Statistics

* Roma remain firmly in contention to finish in the top four of Serie A (SA). Their three most recent league outings have seen at least one team fail to score, and consequently, Roma will try to complete their first run of three consecutive SA clean sheets for the first time since May 2018.
* The ’Giallorossi’ are still the only SA team to remain unbeaten at home (W9, D3), netting 3+ goals in the last three such outings, and winning each of that trio. Roma often get the job done early at the Stadio Olimpico, as they were leading here in a league-high nine matches at HT, winning seven of them (W7, D2).
* After three losses within their last five SA matches, AC Milan find themselves slipping away from the title race. Bad luck has played its part, with the ’Rossoneri’ hitting the woodwork a league-high 15 times. Additionally, their shot rate conversion (29.8%) is the worst amongst the current top five sides.
* A 2-0 loss at Spezia in their previous league trip was Milan’s first defeat away from the San Siro Stadium after 419 days. However, they remain the league’s top away side (W9, D1, L1), and amazingly, have led at HT in all nine wins! Any such interval lead should be ‘to-nil’, with just one of the last 16 SA H2Hs held here witnessing both teams score before HT.
* **Players to watch**: **Henrikh Mkhitaryan** has been involved in 17 Roma’s SA goals this season (nine goals, eight assists), with each of his last six strikes arriving before the break. Meanwhile, **Ante Rebić** has scored three of his four SA goals this season across the last three appearances, netting twice beyond the hour mark.
* **Hot stat**: Milan have scored more than their 1.95 goals per SA game at this stage just once since the 2000/01 season.",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 24,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/ltq0q6/rivalry_watch_matchday_24/,2021-02-27 23:08:40

Roma will have to do without Dzeko for at least two weeks. Perhaps the Bosnian will be able to make it for the first leg of the Europa League against Shakhtar (11 March), but at the moment the small injury to the left adductor will force him to miss the league matches against Milan, Fiorentina and Genoa.

It is a problem for coach Fonseca and Roma because despite the excellent moment of Borja Mayoral (starter in the last 5 games of the championship) the Bosnian not only represents an extra weapon, but was also returning to more than good levels after Covid and the problems with the coach.

It happens in football, and I don't think we've suddenly turned into a shit team just because we're not firing on all cylinders right now.

The big difference between Milan now and Milan four years ago is that four years ago our base level was shit, occasionally interrupted by a period of overachievement. Back then our team was literally just not good enough to beat any top side in Italy. Now it is, and we've beaten all of them except for Atalanta. We didn't achieve that because of luck or magic, but because we've got a very good team. A run of poor form doesn't change that. And the level of quality that we've shown over the last year is, historically, the normal level this club for this club to be at. Being a top club is what Milan does. We've had some rough years recently, but man... what does it say about us as a club and as fans if a run of bad form counts more than a year of being virtually impossible to beat?

2013 to 2019 was an abnormal time in Milan's history. 2020 was normal. I have supported this club for so many years now that I know that. Our biggest problem right now is not that we've played badly for a couple of weeks, lost two league games in a row and scraped through on away goals against Red Star in the Europa League. The problem is that that was all it took for everyone to panic and start worrying that all is lost. What kind of small club mentality is that?

I welcome the draw against Man Utd in the EL. It feels perfectly normal for us to be playing them in Europe. And I look forward to the game against Roma on Sunday.

CTMG101,1614355202.0,lt0nzi,59.0,162.0,"Hey folks, United supporter here. I just thought I'd hop over here in light of the Europa League draw this morning and share a quick story. Let me take you back to 2007, I was just a 6 year old lad with an extremely mild interest in football. That being said I was definitely a Man United supporter due to my family. I would rarely watch full games, let alone track whom we were drawn against in Europe. But by some strange twist of fate found myself sat cross legged in front of the TV for the first leg of our Champions League clash that year...

Wow wow wow. That match single handedly sparked my passion for the game, it was mesmerising. Looking through the team sheets was like taking a stroll past a who's who of football legends, Rooney, Kaka, Ronaldo, Seedorf, Scholes, Pirlo. The game had me hooked from kickoff to full time, but there was one player in particular that caught the eye. Kaka. He was like nothing I'd ever seen before, it was as if he could waltz through midfield with all the grace of a balet dancer. The Brazilians second left me reluctantly deflated, that is until Wayne Rooney popped up with that injury time rocket past Dida at his near post. 3-2. What a game. What a pair of teams.

I was heartbroken when Carlo dismantled us at the San Siro in the second leg, 3-0. The only consolation in hindsight is that Milan, and Pipo Inzaghi in particular went on to beat Liverpool in the final. Since then I've always had a soft spot for Milan, and for Kaka. I was buzzing when we get drawn against each other this morning. It's a shame how far we've both fallen in the last ten years, but here's hoping this tie can recapture the magic of the one I watched when I was 6.",ACMilan,"A United supporter here, with a short story.",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/lt0nzi/a_united_supporter_here_with_a_short_story/,2021-02-27 00:00:02

Samkazi23,1614321595.0,lsrvig,56.0,15.0,"**AC Milan qualified to the next round of Europa League after drawing in the San Siro stadium 1-1 against Red Star Belgrade. Coach Stefano Pioli talked about the game to the media during the press conference. Here are his words:**

On Mandzukic and Bennacer: 

“We will know more about their conditions early next week.”

On the physical decline:

“You insist so much on the physical decline but the data say that it is not so, perhaps the decline is more mental than physical. A delicate moment of the season.”

Does Milan have to find the middle ground between what it was before and what it is now?

“I agree. We have to lead the game more and build better, we will definitely try.”

Do you need points or play to change the negative trend?

“Both things, let’s not forget that qualifying was important. To get back to improving the game you need to lead the games and have confidence in your qualities.”

Are you not worried?

“During a season there are moments like this, it’s not our best moment. We played a game with little precision but always determined.”


“Suffering until the end, it was a hard-fought match, we weren’t lucid in managing the advantage. I think it can do the team good.”

On Red Star: 

“They did well in the first leg and return, we had scored to get back in the lead and we were not able to exploit that. We recovered a lot of balls but we weren’t precise in our passes.”

On the result: 

“The goal was to pass through. The team was aware that they had not played their best game.”

On the positive aspects:

“We had a lot of determination, we worked as a team. You can play at a better technical level and we will try to do it already in the next match against a very strong opponent.”


“The team is mentally mature, it is clear that we are not in our best moment. The positive results gave us confidence. We had a serious race, we are sorry we did not manage the advantage well, but it was It is important to pass the round against an opponent who created difficulties for us but Milan still deserved it.”

On the tactical difficulties of the team:

“Before we were better in our ability to command the games from the back. This allowed us offensive solutions. We must return to dominate the games a little more and suffer less, we need a more precise construction and more coordinated movements. We will work a lot on that.”

On the current moment of the team

“I try to stay close to my players, I try to encourage them, when there was a need to say things we did it. Responsibility is putting a bit of a brake on us and it doesn’t have to be like that. We are a team very young, we must also go through these difficulties together.”

#Rade Krunic was interviewed by Sky Sport during the post-match. Here are his statements:

On Milan’s current form:

“We lost some confidence in ourselves. The match against Spezia above all, in the derby we didn’t play so badly but it can happen to lose. We missed a match, it happens to all teams. We have to continue as we did in 2020 and do the best we can.”

#Soualiho Meite was interviewed by Milan TV at the end of Milan-Red Star game. Here are his words:

“A tough match against a good team. We went through but we are aware that we didn’t have a good match. We are happy with the qualification but we know we need to do more.”

“We played many games, it’s not easy to play every three days. There is a bit of tiredness. We have a good group, we must have the right mentality to go forward.”

On Kessié:

“He is speaks French like me, communication is easier. We help each other a lot and we talk to help the team.”",ACMilan,AC Milan vs. Red Star Belgrade | Stefano Pioli and Rade Krunic's Post Match Interviews,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/lsrvig/ac_milan_vs_red_star_belgrade_stefano_pioli_and/,2021-02-26 14:39:55
Samkazi23,1614320563.0,lsrmrw,27.0,120.0,"

Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave a long interview to the microphones of UEFA and discoveryplus.se. He spoke  about many topics. Here are his words:

On coach Pioli: 

“Perhaps I zlatanised Pioli. I already knew him because I played against him in Italy before. The teams he has had have gone up and down a lot, from top teams to small teams.” 

“He arrived in a Milan where the environment was difficult. When he took over the team. he was not where we are now. If we are where we are now, it is thanks to him and the work he has done. Thanks to the way he works, to his mentality. He puts a lot of pressure on the team, he demands a lot, even if it is a young team. Maybe he has more patience than me, but obviously he is more mature and more experienced than I am.” 

“Pioli is used to working under pressure. He has been in situations where until the last two or three months he has had to fight to stay in Serie A. This of course is different from when you have to fight to win, but at the same time there is it’s a lot of pressure because you have a team that is not at the level of the top five where you fight for the title. Instead, you fight not to be relegated and play in Serie A.”

“Mister Pioli came here and demonstrated, with his work, that he is a great coach. Now there is no longer any discussion as to whether he is the most suitable for this job or not.”

On if Zlatan would have been more useful to them team if he were a young player:

“I don’t know, when I was young, there were other fantastic players close to me. When I arrived to Italy. for the first time I had players next to me who saw me as the young kid who brought so much energy and adrenaline. At the time if you were considered a great player, you were really a great player and to become one you had to play well and show off for a long time. Today the new generation plays five minutes and they see them as great players. I am glad to come from the old school. Social media have changed everything, today thanks to social platforms, players are seen as champions despite having done little perhaps. It wasn’t like that before. Today it is different. I like the old school more. To be recognized as great, you had to show it and work more.”

On Lebron James: 

“I like him a lot. What Lebron does is phenomenal, but I don’t like it when people with some kind of ‘status’ talk about politics. Do what you are good at. Do what you do. I play football because I’m the best at it. I don’t do politics. If I had been a politician, I would have been in politics. This is the first mistake famous people make when they feel like they have made it. For me, it is better to stay away from these topics, and do what you are good at. Otherwise, you risk not making a good impression.”

On his relationship with his teammates:

“When you play at these levels, at such high levels, there is always the same pressure no matter who you are. If you are here, you are here because you deserve it, you are here because you are good enough. You are not here because someone has to wait for you. You are here to play football. I don’t care if you are young or not, I can’t think about the fact that you are young and your time will come, no. When you play for Milan there is no time, you have to do well now. If I don’t play well , Milan will buy another striker at the next transfer market who will play better than me, that’s why I have to play well and this applies to everyone. We all have to be up to it regardless of whether we are young or mature. Off the pitch obviously it’s different, if you are Rafael Leao I talk to you and I treat you in a way. If you are Simon Kjaer, you are more mature, you have children, obviously it’s different. But on the pitch they are all the same.”

On the Brazilian Ronaldo: 

“I always tell everyone who plays with me this: ‘Ronaldo is the game of football. For me, Ronaldo is football. The way he moved, the way he took double steps, his dirrbles… For me he is the greatest player in history, without a doubt.”

mickm95,1614291472.0,lsii4t,84.0,23.0,"I commented this on the MT but I feel it needs deeper discussion:

“The Romagnoli dilemma: bench and take away the captain band from a guy who has been our best cb for years to destroy what’s left of his confidence OR keep him as captain and let him underperform and cost us goals so he destroy his confidence himself.”

So what’s the right thing to do here? 

Lot of people saying Pioli doesn’t have the balls to bench him but it’s not just benching a player, it’s benching the captain, the best CB we had on the banter era and we know how good he can be. Something that may demoralize the whole squad. 

On the other hand Alessio has been doing mistake after mistake, looking shaky and doubtful. For today match he was overcompensating his poor defensive performance going up a lot in attacks. 

A captain portrays the state of the squad and transmit his leadership. He is indeed portraying the state of the team very well with low confidence, mistake after mistake and lack of desire. 

The captain should never be the liability of the squad and the pressure should never consume him like it’s consuming Roma. 

IMO He should step back from the role for a while, gain form again and re earn the band.

WhyAlwaysMe_45,1614112498.0,lqsbvh,4.0,21.0,"So, I found online that a group of Milan ultras (20 people) brutally attacked Genoa supporters, resulting in one murder. It then turned into a brawl between each team's supporters. 

The match was abandoned. A few minutes later, the stadium announcer said something in italian and the fans (I assume Genoa's, but I'm not even sure) started clapping. I don't know if he announced that the match was abandoned or if he said something else, but it seems like it calmed down the fans (at least some of them). 

Anyway, I'm curious if any of you have any more information on the subject, or if any of you were actually there in 1995. I'm confused as to why our ultras attacked Genoa fans. As far as I know, we have no reason to hate them and they haven't done any harm to us before (I might be wrong though, but I doubt it). Do Genoa fans still hate us to this day? 

Also, here are the links where I got my information from: https://youtu.be/H-NZirDVeOM and http://tdifh.blogspot.com/2011/01/29-january-1995-death-of-vincenzo.html?m=1 (this is all I could find online)

link19_86,1614086869.0,lqiei7,36.0,166.0,"""As long as AC Milan was a collective, there was collaboration, synergy, internalization of the game that allowed young people to shine and play by heart, enhancing their qualities, thus bridging the gap that exists with other great qualities.  and experience.  On the other hand, with Spezia, none of this was seen and it was no coincidence that Milan lost.  The same was repeated with Inter.  In the first half hour the Nerazzurri could score four goals ... The first goal conceded after only four minutes is emblematic: ready go, Lukaku launched who goes away easily to Romagnoli.  If Lukaku receives the ball and leans on the defender, he knocks him over.  If he goes away fast, he tarmacs him.  The only thing is to anticipate it, otherwise you are finished.  Romagnoli has never done it.  He is a good player but he has grown and improved too little in recent years.  I have a feeling that he is satisfied.  On the occasion of the goal he was alone, badly positioned, the team didn't help him, they were scattered on the pitch like a loose group.  If Milan plays like this they can lose to anyone.  The start of the second half must not be misleading with the great interventions of Handanovic.  They could have scored a goal, but today's AC Milan lacks the pressure, the organization, that moving together reducing the spaces that allowed them to be in the lead for a long time.  Milan began to feel too good and the cunning emerged that are the antechamber of difficulties and defeats.  Calabria sought a yellow card for not playing with Spezia.  The management had to scold him.  Not to mention Ibra in Sanremo.  If he goes to the Festival, the others are also justified in going around Italy.  Football at these levels is a serious matter.  The club with its history and its rules comes before the team, as this comes before any single.  Leadership is shown with facts and the rules must apply to everyone.  By now it's too late, Ibra should be the one to decline and make a gesture that would be enormous and appreciated by all the Milan fans.  Otherwise I don't think they would understand it.  When things don't work out, you have to try to correct the most important and work only on that: the organization in the field.

USdayNEWS,1613937952.0,lp5c3m,3.0,1.0,"Romelu Lukaku has been supplied strict instructions to prevail in Milan derby, Sunday afternoon – by his mum.

According to sources in Belgium, the Inter Milan striker has been wanted by his mother Adolphine to do anything it takes to ""exact revenge on Zlatan Ibrahimovic"" at the San Siro following the two former Manchester United team-mates disputed spectacularly.

Ibra was cited for telling Lukaku to ""go and do your voodoo s\*\*\*, you little donkey"" and ""go and call your mama"" back the two powerhouse forwards battled during Inter's Coppa Italia quarter-final success over bitter neighbors AC Milan last month.

The Swedish striker was given a red card, while Lukaku was later ejected for improper conduct after calling his rival for a fight by telling: ""You want to talk about my mum? Let's go inside.""

Not every ball should be sent to Ibra always, i know he is our point of reference in the attack but big teams are learning how to play against it.


The defense needs a change as well, yes Romagnoli played poorly today but he has done this every time we played against big teams.
CL strikers, the likes of City,Bayern,RMA,Barca, PSG, ATM will eat him alive if he gets to play against them.
He shouldn’t have an undisputed position in the defense!
Kjaer meanwhile is showing consistency so pairing him with Tomori(+ the fact Kjaer speaks English more than Roma, will help tons).

Alexis is not in form this is true, I saw someone’s reply and he said that Alexis should be loaned and I agree with that.
Castillejo is coinflip, so we really need to start looking for a winger.

Tonali is smart, slowly evolving but smart.
This is personal but i would love to see him behind the strikers sometimes.

# Statistics

* Tied on 18 league titles apiece, these eternal foes will clash in the 178th top-flight ‘Derby della Madonnina’. Prepare for war, as only one of the last 11 competitive H2Hs has featured less than 4.5 yellow cards - with four of the last six seeing over 6.5!
* With AC Milan failing to win any of their previous three encounters vs a fellow top-six side held here (D1, L2), this fixture could hardly have come at a worse time for them. Indeed, the former ‘invincibles’ have suffered all three of their Serie A (SA) losses this term inside the previous seven rounds (W4, L3).
* That noted, Milan have won a league-high of 14 matches when leading at HT, including the reverse H2H. On that note, 19 (70.37%) of the last 27 post-war SA seasons to see either Milan club win the Scudetto saw the eventual champion avoid defeat in a league derby.
* Leading ‘to-nil’ at HT in each of their last four top-flight wins, new SA title favourites Internazionale have won three of their last four matches against a current top-seven side. They beat a -1 handicap in the last two such wins, while also netting an average of 3.0 goals across their last three SA matches against all opponents.
* Historically, Inter hold the upper hand in top-flight clashes (W68, D55, L54). More topically, Inter’s win rate of 83.33% across the last six competitive H2Hs has contributed to that positive all-time league record, with half of their last 40 SA wins over Milan yielding a HT/FT double.
* **Players to watch:** Each of the previous three competitive H2Hs have seen both **Zlatan Ibrahimović** (MIL) and **Romelu Lukaku** (INT) find the net. Ibrahimović has already scored six SA braces this season, whilst Lukaku has netted twice within 25 minutes in his previous two goalscoring league outings.
* **Hot stat:** Combined, nearly a quarter (24.62%) of the career goals scored by the ‘players to watch’ between the 76th-90th+ minute have proven decisive.",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 23,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/lnm8v7/rivalry_watch_matchday_23/,2021-02-20 02:02:44

Also, guess who Lazio bought this month? The great-grandson of Mussolini. Yes, that fucking MUSSOLINI. Call it a coincidence if you want, but I highly doubt it. It had to be the only well-known fascist club in the country that signs a relative of the biggest fascist leader ever.

In our traditional 4-2-3-1 we rely mostly on Bennacer and Hakan for our attacking moves with occasional inclusion of Theo to carry the ball from defence to attack but if these are neutralised all we have is long balls to Zlatan who can hold the ball and distribute it to wingers or to Hakan hoping to create something.

Can’t we have an alternate option of 4-3-2-1 with Tonali/Bennacer as DM and Kessie-Bennacer/Meite so that when opponents pressurise us and we are unable to transition from defense to attack we can use our DM to distribute balls to our forwards instead of Hakan having to carry the ball up front.",ACMilan,Do we have an issue of tactical rigidity?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/ll1qui/do_we_have_an_issue_of_tactical_rigidity/,2021-02-16 19:15:56

lovelornscientist,1613252931.0,lja536,33.0,1.0,"Milan have significant troubles trying to play from the back. We got completely destroyed by Atalanta a few weeks ago and by Spezia this week.

What are the issues in Pioli’s tactics causing this disaster? 

Here are some issues I spotted. 

1. Obviously we didn’t have Calabria tonight so the entire right flank defense or offense was nonexistent. Dalot tonight was probably the worst player I have ever seen. He had no confidence and had no capability of playing the ball forward. 
2. The left flank is always exposed although this is excusable because Theo is used as a high risk high reward player so such gap is expected. Last week we almost let Ounas through, and this week the team got destroyed by Agudello.
3. Ismael had an ok game. His long passing wasn’t accurate but he didn’t give up possession too cheaply. Hakan was really underwhelming today and he didn’t help the transition offense much. He is also not super comfortable under pressure most of times. 

How can we improve?",ACMilan,Milan can’t play against high pressing team,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/lja536/milan_cant_play_against_high_pressing_team/,2021-02-14 05:48:51

For sure most of you would say, hey how can you possibly know better than Pioli or whatever but I am just basing my opinion on what I see, that's it. Maybe Pioli's understanding of perfect left wing is just different than mine.

If he is simply looking for someone who can just outrun any right wing defender and cross inside, then sure, Leao can do that. If you watch this [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiFpN3W3rpA), that's basically what he does most of the time. However I find most of his dribbles pretty clumsy, I'd prefer someone more technical as a winger. And I strongly believe in future of Leao as our long term centre forward. 

Please vote in the poll which position do you think is the perfect for Leao, I am interested in seeing the results.

# Statistics

* A surprising 2-1 victory at Sassuolo last time out saw Spezia break their recent three-game winless run in Serie A (SA) (D1, L2) and elongate their gap from the relegation zone back to six points. However, their fixtures are usually very tight, considering that each of their last ten league matches have separated the sides by under 1.5 goals (W3, D2, L5).
* Spezia have been disappointing at home though, picking up just one SA win here (D3, L6) with no other side registering fewer points when playing at home. Furthermore, the hosts have a tendency to lose concentration near the end of play here, as Spezia have lost a league-high of five home matches after a level HT scoreline.
* AC Milan beat Spezia in the reverse fixture 3-0, netting all three strikes beyond the 56th minute. Additionally, the ‘Rossoneri’ scored three goals inside the 64th-70th minute period of their last match (W 4-0 vs Crotone), in turn winning their 15th SA match this term and keeping their two-point lead at the top.
* The visitors have had no fear on the road, and are comfortably the division’s best away side ahead of this round (W9, D1). Much of that has been down to them starting well, and subsequently leading at HT in all nine victories, with Milan opening the scoring inside the first 30 minutes in the last four.
* **Players to watch**: **Emmanuel Gyasi** (SPE) has scored two of his three competitive goals this term beyond the hour mark, including the winner last time out. However, all eyes will likely be on **Zlatan Ibrahimović** (MIL), after the ageless Swede claimed his sixth SA brace of the season in the previous round. If Spezia were to concede a Zlatan goal, the Ligurians would become the 33rd Italian team to be punished by the Swede in his career.
* **Hot stat**: Milan have won a league-high 14 matches when leading at HT, which is five more than any other side.",ACMilan,Rival Watch - Matchday 22,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/li9m7w/rival_watch_matchday_22/,2021-02-12 19:57:48

If this has been posted before, I apologize I'm just trying to give some information to the ones out there that actually need it 😊

And please, if you guys have any other suggestions then share with us, I'm always looking for more Calcio!!! 😄 


THESE ARE ALL PODCAST IN ENGLISH 

THESE ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN Google Podcasts, you can look for them in your preferred platform 

If you're looking for Milan Specific, my top 3 suggestions in order:
1 Milan Weekly Podcast. 
2 SempreMilan. 
3 The Milan Guys. 
4 You also have other ""minor"" one like AC Milan Offside. 

If what you want is Serie A: 
1: Calcioland Podcast. 
2 IFTV (Mostly fun because of all the nonstop banter running amok 😂)
 3: Serie A Sitdown (Hosts are Milan fans but fully open to the league).
 4 The Italian Football Podcast. 
5 Calcio Connection (Full of Interisti and Lazziale (probably spelled those wrong).

After that there's some I don't frequent very often.

The Calcio Guys

Yesterday he had so much missplaced crosses it was getting kinda frustrating watching him with the ball. Casti is also frustrating but even though he has tendency to murder any chance of counter attack, he always finds himself in penalty area and bags a goal.

**It's the eve of a very important fixture for the Rossoneri: AC Milan v Manchester United, a match scheduled for 21:00 CET on Thursday 18 March at San Siro. Ahead of the announcement of the Diavolo's squad and the upcoming showdown, Stefano Pioli and Simon Kjær held a press conference from Milanello.**

#STEFANO PIOLI

* **THE EUROPA LEAGUE**
""All of the games we've played have improved us and helped us to grow. However, the results is the important thing tomorrow and we want to progress against a strong opponent. We need to go for the win. Everyone likely joined to be here, but we must not rest. As Kjær said, we've done well until now be we'd be disappointed if we reached the end of the season empty-handed.""

* **INJURIES**
""Bennacer and Ibra are in the squad and available. I'm happy with their recovery. Having Zlatan back is huge; he doesn't have 90 minutes in the legs but we'll see tomorrow. We'll need to wait and see with the others; tomorrow morning's training session will be key for Romagnoli, Rebić, Calabria and Leão. The more options I have, the better - especially because we are playing so many games. In any case, we've shown that we can do well even during injury crises.""

* **THE IMPORTANCE OF IBRA**
""Zlatan's arrival last January - along with Kjær - improved the squad in terms of depth and resilience on the pitch. I don't know if he was good at Sanremo, I didn't watch it, but he's an absolute champion on the üitch and we all expect a lot from him until the end of the season.""  

* **MANCHESTER UTD AWAY FROM OLD TRAFFORD**
""The difficulties will all be there; we know how good they are and what they bring to the table. They haven't lost a game in a while and we'll need to play with a lot of quality, personality and rhythm if we want to go through.""

* **AFTER AC MILAN V NAPOLI**
""Those situations involving Gigio, Theo and Rebić can happen. It was a nervy and difficult game but we can't have a repeat performance. We need to learn to be a bit more rational.""  

* **THE RESULT FROM THE FIRST LEG**
""When you prepare for games, you look at the big picture but it's hard to make exact predictions. In the first leg, they tried to be aggressive and we played out from the back really well. The result at Old Trafford shouldn't affect us. Tomorrow, we can't dictate the game; we need to be compact, balanced and dangerous.""



#SIMON KJÆR

* **THE FIRST LEG**
""We must, and can, always improve, the away fixture gave us some indications as to what we need to carry on doing and what we will have to do better.""

* **THE TEAM'S DEVELOPMENT**
""The way I see it, it's no longer the case that this is a team of young lads. It's been a long journey getting this far; there have been lots of good moments and some difficult ones, but we've always had the right mindset. Knocking Manchester United out of the Europa League would be an important milestone for the team - a sign of growth. Tomorrow is a final, if we go on to the next round then we won't have won anything but it will be a very important step.""

* **THE RETURN OF IBRA**
""He can always give something, both on and off the pitch, whether he's playing or not. It's difficult for me to talk about the chances of him playing tomorrow evening. But whether it's out on the pitch or in the dressing room, he has the capacity to add so much to the team.""

* **MANCHESTER UNITED’S ABILITY**
""We were well aware that we would be facing off against a good team, but at the same time, we also knew that we would create lots of problems for them by playing to the best of our ability. I know Cavani very well, having coached him many years ago at Palermo, and he is an extraordinary attacker. But we're not bothered about who will be playing for the other side, we have a lot of respect for them but we will play in our own way, regardless.""

* **CHANGING ROOM**
""From the very first day, I was asked to lend a hand in the changing room and set an example to the youngest players in terms of work and professionalism. The group is fantastic, we're hungry to improve and want to learn. We've been on a great journey together and I've learnt a lot, but we need to carry on going down this path and keep working hard every day. We mustn't give up.""

* **UNDERSTANDING WITH TOMORI**
""I didn't know Fikayo before he arrived, but his mentality has been important right from the get-go. He was eager to prove himself and has done very well. He's a very fast defender and much more aggressive than most in Serie A. We've spoken a lot before games to better understand each other's movements. He hasn't surprised me because he possesses great qualities.""",ACMilan,"Kjaer: It's been a long journey getting this far; there have been lots of good moments and some difficult ones, but we've always had the right mindset.

On the match

“Not everything went in our favour, it’s not the match we prepared. We had to do some things and others came out because they were in good shape. This game was messy, we created a few chances but we didn’t make good use of them.”

On the Champions League race

“We are not afraid, if you are afraid, you lose them all. You have to turn the page and start over, we must aim high, we are there and we must not give up.”

On the personal season

“I started further back, I had difficulties because I came from a stopped period. I knew that this path was not easy, I’m growing slowly, this is the path. I have to grow game after game and try to have consistency, it’s a fundamental thing for a player.”

On set-pieces

“These are things that we prepare during the week, they are studied by the coach and the staff. They study us and we study the inactive balls. When Calha is not on the pitch, I take them. I try to do them with the greatest concentration possible, because at the end the dead balls are all opportunities.”

Samkazi23,1615761429.0,m566rm,32.0,1.0,"Pioli spoke to Sky Italia after the game, with his comments transcribed by MilanNews and translated below.

On the match: “The team was competitive, in the first half we didn’t concede so much. We didn’t play a great game on a technical level, too many wrong passes, then the goal we conceded when we were doing better than them. You can miss a pass in midfield but we had to be quicker to recover positions.”

On the standings: “We lost an opportunity, it could have been an exceptional week for us, we couldn’t repeat ourselves tonight. We had a good match against an excellent opponent. We need to think about the next match against a strong opponent, then Fiorentina. Inter did very well after being eliminated from Europe, we are looking to score as many points as possible.”

On tactics: “In the build-up we had to be faster, we could attack the depth, we lacked the technical precision but also the movements. In the goal they scored we lost a ball where we could manage the transition better, when you lack a bit of movement it becomes more it was difficult. The reaction was there, we had an important scoring ball with Leao, the penalty was more than there wasn’t. Something more was needed, unfortunately we didn’t succeed.”

On absences: “When there are a lot of little things you lose, we are talking about players who give us an important technical quality and a communicative presence, we have lost many games without a centre-forward, without Ibra, Mandzukic and Rebic. The team should only be praised. Inside the area opponent we could have done more, but the characteristics cannot be changed. Think of Inter without Lukaku, Lautaro and Sanchez, or Juve without Ronaldo and Chiesa. We played for a long time without Ibra and Rebic and yet we are there.”

On the problems between the lines: “We can’t do things halfway, when you do them halfway, you stretch the team and give space to Napoli. It takes more compactness, we haven’t always succeeded, I don’t think it’s Calhanoglu’s fault. We had to be more dangerous in the counters.”

On European commitments: “The Europa League is more tiring than the Champions, we returned at 3 in the morning on Friday. We wanted this path, I don’t give excuses, but it is clear that it weighs. We started in September, but what matters is the character. It is a defeat that hurts us, we are second in the standings, we would like to stay there even if it is not our initial goal. We try to recover energy and some players because Manchester are a very strong team.”

herbrovore,1615761143.0,m5637f,14.0,1.0,"Preface: What this team has accomplished thus far is incredible. They have only exceeded expectations which has made for a very enjoyable season, but there is still much work to be done. Also apologizes for formatting- on mobile. 

For me, the reality is the entire attacking presence of the team needs to be scrapped with the exception of Laeo, Rebic, Hauge, and Maldini.

Let’s go player by player.

Zlatan: While he has had an enormous impact both on and off the pitch, he was always a short term solution. The injuries will only become more frequent and it is ignorant to become reliant on someone of his age. His wages are also a major barrier.

Mandzukic: Rather unfortunate injury but was never going to be sticking around

Diaz: Although he is exciting, it’s difficult for me to justify the fee Real are going to want for him given the impact he has. He is promising and will likely turn into a great player but I don’t see these hopes being enough to make the investment 

Castillejo: Castillejo has had some bright moments in his 100 games with Milan but from a quality perspective he doesn’t offer enough for me. Often times feels like he is better off the bench but he isn’t strong enough on the ball. 

Haken: For what he wants, he is not worth it. Man disappears way too frequently and Milan fans obsess over his few hot patches. Good player but similar to Suso it’s time to move on. 

Krunic: Good player, not Milan quality

Saekemaekers: Man is not an attacker, he should be playing wingback imo. I love his work rate and believe he should stay with the team just not as an attacker.

matheusagra,1615746808.0,m50xmw,11.0,1.0,"So, a few months ago I said Mario’s possibly arrival was a “Video-Game move” as the player would not (likely) return to top perfomance and give technical return to the rossoneri (all of that beside his pretty much high salary, due to Milan’s actual standards and Donnarrumma’s gap being aprox. the same amount invested in the player) I received a large amount of downvotes and was called “crazy” because I said that I would: Bring an backup, possibly an starter for the position of Calabria (turning him a perfect deputy or having a great deputy) and a right winger (possibly playable as a CAM, due to absence of a bench player for Hakan’s position. I was told Mandzukic’s winning mentality would be enough for his signing (which I do agree at some level, although I believe the CL qualification dream would be very much possibly without his presence or 1.8 net salary, so far). Now, I ask you fellow Milan supporters. How our second in line ST has impressed so far? I am still a madman for believing both the whole right side and the back up left side must be improved?

Samkazi23,1615648502.0,m48798,14.0,1.0,"Gennaro Gattuso’s time at Milan as a player was characterised by success, but also some legendary pranks from Andrea Pirlo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and more.

The Napoli coach returns to San Siro for the first time as an opposition coach tomorrow evening and it’s bound to be emotional, as he spent most of his career in this stadium as a player and then tactician.

Although Gattuso has not written his own memoirs, he is a regular in the books of his former teammates, largely for the pranks that were played.

Probably the most famous incident saw Ibrahimovic grow tired of Gattuso’s badgering during a training session, so he lifted the midfield up and deposited him head-down into a bin.

Thiago Silva revealed their Rossoneri teammates were “bent over double with laughter” and Ibrahimovic confirmed the bizarre scene only a few days ago.

Currently the Juventus coach, Pirlo’s book has plenty of anecdotes from his days trying to get a rise out of Gattuso.

They ranged from scaring him in the middle of the night by hiding in a hotel room to using his phone to call director Ariedo Braida and negotiate a new contract.

They all ended the same way, with Gattuso slapping Pirlo on the back of the head repeatedly and muttering barely-understandable obscenities in Calabrese dialect.

The ultimate Gattuso moment occurred during a Milan dinner, when he spotted a slug and bet with Kakha Kaladze that he’d eat it.

Much to everyone’s amazement, Rino swallowed the creature whole.

“It was a bet with Kaladze,” confirmed Gattuso many years later. “Nobody thought I’d actually eat it, but I did it to help us become more of a team.”

Kaladze is now a high-ranking politician in Georgia, but he was at the centre of many Gattuso pranks, including one recounted by Carlo Ancelotti.

The defender warned everyone to completely ignore Gattuso’s birthday on January 9, then the day after, he stood up during lunch and announced: “Lads, there are 364 days to go until Gattuso’s birthday!”

Gattuso spent 13 years at Milan, scoring 11 goals in 468 competitive games, yet there was one moment when he was ready to walk away for Bayern Munich.

Then-CEO Adriano Galliani decided giving him a speech about the importance of the Rossoneri wasn’t going to cut it, so he locked the player in the Milan Museum.

“He told me, this is your home,” confessed Rino. “It was never an issue of money with me, I always had Milan in my heart.”

Now he will face them as an opponent at San Siro for the first time.

* **Tonali said there is a photo of Rio Ave-Milan in the locker room, is it the spark?**

""It is the spark that Milan must always have, in a season there are difficulties to overcome, they served to stimulate us, to wake us up, they made us grow. That photo there reminds us of a particular evening, it is useful to understand which steps we have overcome. to get here "".

* **Napoli arrives tomorrow ...**

""They plays good football, it has quality, it is compacted. A complicated game awaits us because Napoli are one of the strongest teams in the league.""

* **How are the injured?**

""The injured are Calabria and Romagnoli, today Alessio trained with the team but he still has some problems. I am in doubt for tomorrow. I think we will recover Theo, Calha and Rebic. For Ibra, Mandzukic and Isma we have to wait until next week"".

* **Is it also important to choose who is mentally better off?**

""The psychophysical condition during a demanding year is inevitable that it may go down for some and improve for others. Tomorrow I will try to choose who is better physically and mentally"".

* **In these matches, Milan seemed more convinced**

""We relaxed only once in La Spezia, in the other games we never lacked determination. I train a group of very responsible players, a group of quality, even in the numerical difficulties I have the possibility of counting on strong players. team and we are active, if we work together, then we can become strong "".

* **Is Milan still aiming for the Scudetto?**

""We have to focus on tomorrow's challenge, the most important match is tomorrow night. We can't do the math, we have to think about winning as many races as possible, tomorrow we have an important chance against a strong opponent who has always put us in difficulty."" .

* **How important was the intensity this season?**

""We had to work a lot, the intensity is first of all mental, in the last few games we have played as a team. It is a challenging way of playing, for many boys it is the first season where it is played every three days, a decline can be there. but we were good at learning from our defeats. Intensity and quality must go hand in hand if we are to maintain these levels. ""

* **What recipe did you use to raise Milan?**

""The work and the belief in our qualities. Stumbling blocks cannot make a team forget how to play, what allowed us to be the surprise of 2020. We just had to review situations and have a much more compact team. Trust it was never lacking even though outside there was talk of so much negativity, but it was not like that "".

* **What do you think of the new postponement of Juve-Napoli?**

""We hope to go forward as much as possible in the Europa League and play every three / four days, we aim to go on until the end. It is better for you to comment on what others are doing.""

* **Should we expect an aggressive Milan tomorrow?**

""I think there is a bit of confusion about aggression, it is the players who have to give messages to the team to give pressure. We have to play with rhythm, we play with rhythm even when you have the ball. You have to move it very quickly, let it run. the opponents. If we want to aim for a top championship we have to improve the home results. ""

* **We have gone from an dependent Milan Ibra to an dependent Pioli**

""Ibra is our beacon but Milan are addicted to our game. There are many leaders because we recognize a certain way of being on the pitch.""

* **Did the owners congratulate you after Thursday's race?**

""The owners are always very close, they congratulate after the victories. Now, however, let's think about Napoli"".

* **You have protected Leao these days**

""I always have to protect my players, especially when I see the right attitudes, sacrifice and work. Everyone has this, even Leao. Last year he lacked knowing how to stay in the game with more continuity, he has improved on this. I expect a lot from him, he is working well for the team, he must continue like this. He has to improve in recognizing game times, at times he wastes energy by sprinting when his teammates cannot serve him. The goal will come. ""

* **Meite is doing very well**

""He has grown a lot, he came from a completely different way of playing, at the beginning he played at a slower pace than his teammates. He was very good, he made very positive performances, he played with rhythm, intensity and quality. He is fine. I'll see what choices to make. Tonali has breathed his breath and I think he can play tomorrow.

* **How do you rate Saelemaekers and Castillejo?**

""In Verona they both did a good performance, giving good solutions, they both give an excellent contribution, they can also do better. We are focused on what needs to be done rather on what we have not been able to do in the past.""

* **How much has Kessie changed in the past year?**

""The merits are all from Franck, he had an important daily application, I don't know how he was in the past. He is mentally very strong, always ready to help his teammates, to do and say the right thing. With the qualities he has he can play anywhere, in the end I put him as an attacking midfielder, now he can do everything. He has an important presence and positivity, he is old enough to grow further. He is becoming a very important player. ""

* **What did Gattuso's job at Milan leave you?**

""He had done a great job here, then Milan went through another coach, it's hard to understand what he left and what didn't.""

* **Where did the idea of ​​putting Kessie playmaker at Old Trafford come from?**

""Diaz had had a good game but he had spent a lot, we wanted to keep the Manchester defenders playing dirty. Having an imposing player who could hold up some aerial duels could be there.""

* **Do you expect an opponent similar to Verona tomorrow?**

""Difficult, there are different ways of playing. They are two very different teams in their positions on the pitch, but it is true that they have physically strong defenders and fast attackers.""

* **How do you improve your pace on the pitch?**

""Especially mentally, if you want to play with rhythm the ball must play fast. When we weren't playing with that rhythm the ball was spinning too slow, then it is difficult to break positions. It is an important goal to move the ball and move well"" .

* **On his goal:** ""I want to be the best and I have to go right on this path and I don't have to settle. I'm like that. What do I think when I aim at the goal? I don't think, I'm going to score. 8, one more than last year. It didn't always come so easy. I started here, at Milan. Because Pioli tells me to go ahead, to push. And then to go back too. So I push and when I see the door , shot. Then there is Ibra who screams, because he wants the ball "".

* **On Ibrahimovic:** ""He gave us courage, gives us lots of advice and sometimes even scolds us (but always to motivate us). When I came back from vacation, he told me: where are you going with 90 kilos here? ""But he also told me that I am strong and that I have to become the best, but that I have to work hard. We follow him, and in training we give everything, always. All together. It has been an incredible year, we are having an incredible year."" And the credit belongs to everyone "".

* **On Pioli:** ""If he is more likeable than Zidane? Yes, have you seen the stories? We have fun. He is strong. Zidane is also nice, but he talks less. Real? Maybe I was too young, if you don't play it is difficult to prove. Pioli he immediately gave me confidence. And I got excited "".

* **On Maldini:** ""It took him time for a coffee to convince me. He called me and joined me in Ibiza, I didn't believe it ... he's a myth for me, he always has been. And his every word is important. Like Marcelo at Real "".

* **On Deschamps's call:** ""I'm waiting, he hasn't called me yet ... (and he gestures on the handset, his recent exultation, ed). It's a dream for me to play with my brother in the France shirt. I said No to the Under of the Galletti? I was little, I didn't realize how important it was. For two years, since I've been here, I've also been playing to go to the national team. I always have the phone in my hand. ""

* **On the championship:** ""There is Inter, there is us, Roma, Juve. Two years ago there was only Juve. We are there and we fight until the end. Inter is a good team, but the Juve is stronger. No, it's not over, everything is still open. We have seen other times the first run away even with many points ahead, and then win the second. This year it's not easy even with the small ones, the ranking counts little. A choice between the Scudetto, a place in the Champions League or the Europa League? No, I want it all. ""

On the previous games: 

“The match against Udinese had to be played like this, in my opinion we didn’t do what we could because I think we could do more, it’s the first thing we said to each other once the match was over. As for the second half in Manchester, you cannot enter the field without malice, determination in a match like this, when you are losing one to zero but you are controlling the game. It is the minimum, it is natural, the companions who have been playing for seventy minutes bring it to you. We know how we are made and what we are made of, working together is more important than any single one, a lot is always played in 11. For 90 minutes any of your mates must be your best friend, a person you defend and sacrifice yourself for. We are a great group and we are showing it even in these difficult moments”.

On the group:

“I often look at the photo of when we were all united in midfield in the rain and with the cold during the penalties with Rio Ave. From that photo, we also printed it in the locker room, you get a spark, it makes you understand where we started from and makes you understand what you went through to get to where we are now. It makes you understand that you have merit because all this did not come by itself but we earned it by sweating, working, running, playing, winning. These are important things, that photo there triggers a spark in us, if we are here there is a reason and therefore we will certainly not give up”.

On Kjaer and Kessie:

“They are examples, not only for us young players but for the whole team, even for Ibrahimovic and the coach. Kjaer is the most professional of the team, the other is our backbone, the column that never gives up that is always on the pitch, in any game and in any minute. They are our two great examples. They give a great boost to all the fans, to all of us teammates, to the coach, to any person in Milan”.

On Pioli: 

“The coach is giving me a lot, he is helping me a lot during training and also in moments away from football, he is giving me a lot for my growth both on and off the pitch. He is a real person, we are always with him.

On whether we can say that Sunday is Pioli’s match:

“Yes, it’s Pioli’s game, Milan’s game because Milan is made for these games, we can’t wait to play them and do great performances like that of Manchester”.",ACMilan,"Tonali: “I often look at the photo of when we were all united in midfield in the rain and with the cold during the penalties with Rio Ave which also in the locker room.

* 22/11/2020, Serie A: Napoli 1-3 AC Milan (Mertens 63' / Ibrahimovic 20', 54', Hauge 90+5')

* 29/01/2019, Coppa Italia: AC Milan 2-0 Napoli (Piatek 11', 27')
* 26/01/2019, Serie A: AC Milan 0-0 Napoli 

# Statistics:

*  Despite recording two wins in their last three Serie A (SA) matches, AC Milan still lag behind rivals Internazionale in the title race. That said, they clearly have the ability to dominate from the outset, having led at HT in a league-high 16 of their 17 SA victories recorded thus far. Curiously, six of the last seven such matches saw Milan precisely leading 1-0 at the break.
* Milan have, however, won only one of their last six competitive home matches within 90 minutes (W1, D3, L2). Additionally, the ‘Rossoneri‘ have gained only 39.29% of their total points tally at home, which is the second-worst rate amongst all teams. Additionally, they have won consecutive SA home matches this term just once.
* Napoli might be the right opponent for them, as the ‘Partenopei‘ are winless here in four competitive H2Hs, scoring just once during the run (D3, L1). Furthermore, each of their last eight competitive wins have arrived at home. However, Napoli are now on a four-game unbeaten run (W3, D1), netting exactly three goals in the last two therein.
* The visitors are winless in six competitive away outings (D1, L5), conceding 3+ goals in four, whilst losing despite a +1 handicap in the other four. Additionally, Napoli have led at the break just once across their last 11 competitive away fixtures while also losing in three SA away matches this term that stood level at HT.
* **Players to watch: Rafael Leão** (MIL) has scored five SA goals this season, with two of the last three arriving inside the opening 30 minutes. Meanwhile, **Lorenzo Insigne** has scored three goals across the last two matches, with two arriving beyond the 75th minute.
* **Hot stat:** Five of the last six H2Hs have seen the opener arriving within the first 25 minutes.",ACMilan,Rivalry Watch - Matchday 27,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/m3hm0u/rivalry_watch_matchday_27/,2021-03-12 21:32:33

On the draw: “I thought it was the right opponent, we are working to grow and try to win again. These are the games that make you grow, that make you question.

On Kjaer’s goal: “There is a lot of satisfaction. I’m not coaching a normal group, it’s an exceptional group, from a technical, professional and human point of view. When I see that the guys gave their soul, it’s right to be satisfied with a very good result. We are happy but we could also have done something more. We have shown that we are up to such a strong opponent.”

The first period at Milan: “Since I arrived, every time I have worn this shirt has been an honor. Tomorrow being able to play this match between two clubs that have made history in Europe will certainly be special and we hope that the result will be positive ”.

On the draw: ""Already after the qualification I felt that we would challenge an English team and obviously meet Manchester United, a great European club, everyone charged, we were waiting for this big match. Now we are here and we want to play a great match to bring home a good result"".

On tomorrow's match: ""We play away with United, it will be difficult but when we play as we know we can beat anyone, we hope so tomorrow, we have prepared well and now we want to play to return to Milan with a positive result"".

On his teammates: ""The Captain, Romagnoli, helped me a lot even though he doesn't speak much English, on the pitch I speak to him in Italian and he speaks to me in English. He tries to help me a lot as does Kjaer, who speaks English, but both they are helping me a lot. They show me the position to hold and make sure that I understand the coach's instructions in training. This helps me a lot, they are two great professionals "".

On his moment: ""I'm fine, I'm happy, I could hardly have asked for more since my start here. I'm playing and everyone has welcomed me very well.

Samkazi23,1615386519.0,m1yok6,9.0,1.0,"What does the Verona victory give you ahead of tomorrow’s match?

“It has to give us more certainty. When we play intensely we are a good team. We are prepared to play a great match tomorrow night as well.” 

Have you found greater security in defence?

“You have to be a team in both phases. If we are more compact and shorter, we can do better in both the defensive and the offensive phases.” 

Did United’s performance against City impress you?

“I was very impressed, United have deservedly won against a fantastic team that haven’t lost in 20/21 games. We studied that game.”

What can you tell us about Dalot? 

“We are very happy with his growth. Future? It’s early, we are focused only on the next matches. Then it’s not up to me to talk about these things.” 

Is it an early final? 

“I don’t think so, there are many strong teams still in the running. It is a prestigious match between two historic clubs with a great past. Now we are working to get back to winning and make our dreams come true.” 

How important will Donnarumma be tomorrow?

“Gigio is decisive for us both in the defensive phase and in the setting. His performance will be very important for us tomorrow.” 

Would a tie be a good result for you?

“Some games just have to be played to the fullest and with great conviction, as well as with great respect for a team that has dropped out of the Champions League. A positive result tomorrow evening would give us an important momentum in view of the return leg.”

In your opinion, how long will it take to see Milan like the one that beat Manchester United in 2007?

“We are working to get back to winning. Maldini said the right things some time ago: it takes a couple of years of regular presence in the Champions League to grow and think about competing at certain levels and winning trophies. There is still a long way to go. that we must face with this conviction and this enthusiasm.”

Did Milan bring out the best of themselves when there are difficulties? 

“We have a choice to make: either let ourselves be overwhelmed by the negative waves or ride the positive ones. And we chose to ride it, then the team will put in a good performance against a difficult opponent.”

Maldini's comments on you say that you are a great talent and the club's will is to keep you in Milan. How do these words make you feel?

"" Obviously it is very nice to hear these things, especially from a legend like Maldini. This gives me a lot of confidence. I want to continue doing what he is doing, playing for the team and for my teammates. The future will be seen. Hearing these words. from a great defender is certainly beautiful ""

How are you in Italy?

""I was expecting a different challenge, in Italy I had to get used to different things, I was worried about the language but there are those who speak to me in English and I try to speak in Italian and slowly we are getting along well"".

Did any team mate ask you what game to expect since you played in England?

""Yes something they asked me but everyone knows United. Everyone knows they are a great team. We have worked hard and analyzed them. We know it will be a difficult match against a team with a very fast attack. Hopefully my experience in England. can help ""

Have you talked to your team-mates at Chelsea and about the experience with manager Tuchel?

""Obviously I often talk to old teammates because they were not only great teammates but also friends. We don't always talk about football but also about other things. They are very well and are satisfied. They are scoring and winning so they are fine. I have not heard from Tuchel. but right now he has to concentrate on Chelsea just as I am focused on Milan ""

How important is this challenge as a final exam for Milan? Are the many absences a problem or a stimulus?

""Of course this is a stimulus. We have a squad and a group and everyone wants to play. We are a strong team and the substitutes for Verona have shown it. We will try to have a great game with Manchester United.""

What do you like about Serie A and Italy and what helped your acclimatization?

""Every person here at Milanello has helped me a lot both with the language and off the pitch. I am trying to learn Italian even if it is a bit difficult.

Injuries, transfer market and renewals. Milan has been bombarded with news for a few days. It is not easy for Pioli’s team at the moment to fight for the goals with all the rumors that disturb the team. This makes the victory against Verona even more special. In just one year, second place in the Championship has become a given. Milan has accustomed its fans to the top ranking. This is certainly good, but it doesn’t have to get frustrating in tough times.

DONNARUMMA SITUATION

There is no good news for his renewal. Milan has not yet found an agreement for his contract extension. According to some rumors, Raiola is now thinking of looking at other clubs. But let’s not joke: Gigio’s will has been clear for some time. He wants to stay at Milan. A player cannot leave due to the will of his agent, who is doing his job (well) right now to get more. But the feeling today, once again, is that Donnarumma will end up staying. He won’t be signing for just one year. It would be too bad for the club and its fans. Gigio does not want the same situation to repeat itself as five years ago.

CALHANOGLU

His renewal has never been seriously questioned. The player also reiterated this to the club in the meeting at Casa Milan a few days ago. Hakan has given his word to Maldini: he will remain with the Rossoneri.

TRANSFER MARKET UPDATE

Milan are working seriously for two signings: the first is Tomori’s from Chelsea. The Rossoneri would like to lower the ransom set by the Blues, but in the end they will be forced to pay the full price, without discounts. In addition to Englishman, Milan are also thinking of Otavio. The Porto player should replace Diaz. The Brazilian only receives 1 million a year. Milan could sign him for almost 2 million. For his part, Dalot, unlike Diaz, could stay: Milan would like to extend his loan for another year and then decide whether to buy the player.

SCENT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

Between the transfer market rumors and the renewals, Milan now has to focus only on the pitch. Tomorrow the Rossoneri will face Manchester United, in a match that could resume last year in the Champions League. Two clubs that have many things in common: both have finally regained their old leadership. Both are in second place. Both are playing the title with the city rival. Both have focused on an emerging technician. Solskjaer also had a tough time, but the Red Devils confirmed it. Right choice. Like Milan with Pioli. Milan are second with seven points clear of fifth place. Milan are in the round of 32 of the Europa League and will face Manchester in a great challenge. Milan is the youngest team in the league and one of the youngest across Europe. Its young players grow up every day.

Samkazi23,1615301767.0,m182d2,21.0,1.0,"

Former AC Milan striker Krzysztof Piatek, who left the Rossoneri on the winter transfer window of 2020 after spending only one year with the Serie A side, has given an interview to Roman Kolton in the Youtube program “Prawda Futbolu“, where the Polish frontman revealed the reason why he left the Milanese club.

 

On whether leaving Milan was due to a lack of patience:

“I don’t know, maybe it was. But above all Ibra arrived and I wanted to play to prepare myself well for the Euro. I couldn’t imagine sitting on the bench for 5-6 games in a row. When Ibra starts the game from the beginning, he practically doesn’t come out anymore, only in case of injuries. This was what it seemed. In the first games after his arrival I didn’t play a minute. I had a chance in the Italian Cup: I scored a goal and made an assist. However, in subsequent meetings I sat on the bench without saying a word. I may have lost my temper, but that was my decision. I’m at Hertha, which aims to be a great club. This year may not be successful, but my contract will continue for another four years“.

On clubs that tried to sign him back then:

“I don’t know if I can talk about it, but Milan must have received an offer from Tottenham to have me on loan for 1.5 years. Harry Kane was injured and I should have replaced him for the first three months. In reality, however, Hertha invested a lot of money in me, offered a permanent transfer and a 4.5-year contract. Everything was in order. Their determination was enormous, they convinced me“.

On Zlatan Ibrahimovic:

“When I was in Milan, I talked to him when we already knew that Poland would play Sweden in the group. I asked him if he was going to the tournament. He replied that such an event was no longer for him and that he was already old, and that there were many young boys who should have tested themselves. But now he’s back. You can see that the goals he scores in Milan have added a little hunger for football“.

“But now I’m a Milan player and if I’ll play, I will give my best for this club.

“If we arrive with today’s confidence, we can certainly do well.”

Dalot scored his first Milan goal against Hellas Verona on Sunday and said it was a reproduction of what they have done in training.

“I’m very happy for my first goal,” he said. “But above all for the performance of the whole team.

“The attitude was the right one and we proved it abundantly.

“I tried to score this goal many times in training. We always finish a lot at the end of training.

**To comment on the moment of Milan, fresh from yesterday's beautiful victory against Verona, the editorial staff of Milannews.it interviewed Angelo Colombo, a former midfielder who in the Rossoneri jersey won a Scudetto, two Champions Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, two European Super Cups and one Italian Super Cup. Here are his words:**

Mr. Colombo, did you like Milan yesterday against Verona?

""Beyond the wonderful goals that Milan scored, it is the game that I really liked. We are back to what we were before despite the important absences"". 

For a coach, preparing a match with all these absences is not easy ...

""The psychological aspect is fundamental in these situations. Having a decline is normal, even the one who wins at the end has a moment of decline during the season. Milan is giving us great satisfaction this year. The Rossoneri have won many games even without Ibrahimovic, but he did it also thanks to the Swede who is important both on and off the pitch. He gave the right mentality to the whole team. This Milan it is quite a beautiful sight. "" 

How important is Ibrahimovic for this team?

""I say that it is almost more important off the pitch than on the inside. When he plays he drags and scores, but the most important thing is what he does outside, he is motivated, he also saw yesterday in Verona. He has great experience, you can see who is comfortable in this environment, has a good relationship with everyone. It had been years since I had so much pleasure watching the matches for Milan. "" 

Do you think he will stay next year too?

""It's nice what he said yesterday. I don't know what will happen. For now, let's think about the pitch and achieving the goals set. In my opinion, the path taken is the right one."" 

What do you think of Kessie? Does it remind you of someone you played with?

""In defending the ball he reminds me of Rijkaard, it is impossible to steal the ball from him. Kessie has a good run and in that he reminds me of Gullit. He is a player of quality and quantity, he has an incredible physical prowess. He is having a great year."" .

Did Mr. Pioli surprise you?

""No. Pioli knows what the players are going through because he was a footballer. He has experience, he has been training at high levels for some time. For me it is important that a coach is a former player because for me he has something more than someone who doesn't played"". 

What advice do you give to Gigio Donnarumma? 

""He grew up at Milan, he has many examples in front of him like Maldini and Baresi who grew up at Milan and who have been at Milan all their careers. I remain confident about his renewal. He is one of the strongest goalkeepers in the world. I hope to see him. make a career at Milan like Baresi and Maldini. Milan needs him, but he also needs Milan. "" 

Among the AC Milan players who surprised you the most?

""What amazes me most is not a single player, but the whole group. Yesterday even those who played less played very well. It is also nice to see everyone celebrating and hugging each other after a goal. it is a united group, this is a very important signal. Football is a collective sport and the group is fundamental. It is really nice to see the union between the players, it is a pleasure to see this Milan. to finish the championship, we are doing very well and we are second.""

Against a team like udinese, we should've drew them out of their area and played on fast breaks instead of our usual press that starts with 10 pases between our defenders before moving the ball forward. That would've allowed us to open up pockets and get through but we kept doing the same thing while expecting a different result. 

Pioli has done a terrific job bringing us of the rut we've been in but I think going forward we need a multidimensional coach that can adapt.

On goal at the last minute:

“We looked for the three points, they are two points lost. We have to raise our heads even if we play a lot of games. Today we did not do well ”

On where do you need to improve:

“In managing the ball, we have to keep the ball more. A match like this can happen, now we immediately raise our heads because we are playing in three days”.

“Milan’s goal is to go to the Champions League, we have to fight until the end.”

On his Goal:

 “Even penalties are not easy to score, I’m not afraid of taking them”.

**Following AC Milan’s game earlier tonight against Udinese in Serie A, the Rossoneri’s right-back Davide Calabria has spoken through the microphones of Milan TV. Here are his statements:**

On tonight’s game:

“It was a difficult match. We lacked brilliance and quality of maneuver, with them closing in. Today, we played a subdued game. Two points were wasted, but the important thing is to have equalized it at the last minute. We have to look each other in the face and decide what to do in order to grow up.”

On the next game against Hellas Verona:

“With Hellas, it will be a very difficult game, we have to work hard”.

On Injuries:

“There are important players missing and the way of being on the pitch changes completely. This year we weren’t particularly lucky in this aspect“.


**AC Milan Coach Stefano Pioli was interviewed by DAZN after the 1-1 against Udinese where Frank Kessie scored an equalizer at the death.**

On Kessie saying Milan lost two points:

“The team wanted the win, we knew that we would find it difficult against a Udinese team that defends with everyone at the back of the ball ”.

On the team conviction:

“We lacked quality and rhythm during the match, there was determination but lack of clarity ”.

On the reaction after the goal:

“The team worked hard to find space but Udinese plays a very defensive game, there were lots of duels we lost.  We only managed to win a duel during the first half when Castillejo almost scored”.

On Leao:

“Rafa has characteristics more suitable for attacking spaces but when he is marked tightly he does not yet have the shrewdness to anticipate the defender. Today we lacked the right characteristics to face this type of match, we lacked the two real strikers (Ibra and Mandzukic) in the squad. Leao and Rebic have other characteristics.”.

On Tonali’s Injury situation:

“Tonali came out as a precaution because he felt a slightly different flexor than the other”

On Donnarumma’s error:

“We haven’t talked yet, he has saved us many times. Now it’s time to focus on the next match”.

On Ibra on the bench:

“He did not come out satisfied with this match, like everyone else”.



**Udinese coach Gotti is furious at the end of the match:**

**“The games usually end five seconds earlier. The last cross shouldn’t have started. I’m pissed. We had three points at the end of the match. Then came the penalty at minute 5: 02 recovery. If it had happened to another team it would have been serious. But we are Udinese. You can’t take this penalty”. – he said to DAZN**",ACMilan,"Milan vs Udinese | Frank Kessie:“We looked for the three points, they are two points lost.

Samkazi23,1614710989.0,lw9his,14.0,1.0,"AC Milan are already thinking of potentially signing Fikayo Tomori on a permanent basis at the end of the season, according to a report.

There were some eyebrows raised when Pioli made the decision to bench captain Alessio Romagnoli for the trip to the capital yesterday despite the bad recent form he has been in, and Fikayo Tomori did not disappoint as he and Simon Kjaer kept the hosts quiet for the most part.

Gianluca Di Marzio reports that Tomori has settled fully into life at Milan. He has played 4 games out of 6 since his arrival, including 3 as a starter. He has immediately integrated into a new league and a new country, and it is no coincidence that Milan have already begun to think about how and when to pay the €28million to buy him outright.

Reassurances about his future in the Rossoneri have already arrived, especially if he were to keep playing this way. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is still monitoring him, but he knows he is starting from a disadvantage.

The player’s agents, on the other hand, have already clarified the player’s stance, talking about a future in Italy given the relationships that immediately arose with his team-mates and with the staff, who were happily impressed by the first tests he had undergone.",ACMilan,Di Marzio: ACMilan planning for Tomori's permanent stay after perfect integration - his entourage sees a future in Italy.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/lw9his/di_marzio_acmilan_planning_for_tomoris_permanent/,2021-03-03 02:49:49

Pioli's limitations are now showing, he has no plan b and doesn't know what to do, keeping the results aside we have been playing the same way since the start of this season.  


1. Ibra as Target man/Leao to run on to balls.
2. Kessie with a defensive role.
3. Bennacer for beating the press.
4. Theo to bomb forward given a chance.

In Italy its not possible to survive with the same tactics, everyone knows that if you want to beat Milan just beat their midfield. The one time we moved to 3 at the back it actually helped but seems Pioli has amnesia. His press conference has always indicated that he has no tactical clue. The same vague stuff like rhythm quality ""we will fight"". He was trying to figure out why we had poor results at home ground and I was thinking why anyone did not laugh at a statement like that, its as if there is something superstitious, better go and check Lukaku's mom.

Theo has been god awful in defense, Rebic ineffective, Tomori and Kjaer have been bad these last games too. 

a 3-5-2 with Romagnoli-Kjaer-Tomori and Theo-Kessie-Tonali-Benna/Meite-Calabria/Saele with Ibra-Rebic/Leao can really help us defensively. Theo could finally break free and we would have some cover left cause of Tomoris pace if given the backup in Romagnoli AND kjaer.

Cartmenez22,1619504531.0,mzi2zn,19.0,1.0,"It might be to early to speculate, and I also think they might just stay with Pioli, but who would you realistically want as the next coach. I was pro Ragnick last year when it was either him or Pioli, but we really cant blame management going with the later. But I always thought he is a limited coach and one who doesnt make his teams play better.
I dont think Ragnick is a choice for next season though.
So I have 3 picks that I would consider.
1. Sarri - I know people might not like him, but his Napoli team plays some great football, and he still did the job at Chelsea and Juve. I think if he goes to Roma, he would suit them well, and I think that we also have some players suited for his formation.
2. De Zerbi - he was my pick before Giampaolo. I have to admit that since Giampaolo I am a bit scared of coaches not doing it at a top level, but I think his Sasuollo plays good football, and he plays formation much more suited to us than Giampaollo did.
3. Allegri - like him or not, he is a winner. He won our last title and then had to use the worst Milan squad ever. Exceeded Contes Juve when he joined them. Does not play exciting football, but I would much rather be competitive, than hipster jerkoff material.

Samkazi23,1619459954.0,mz3pt7,16.0,1.0,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out of action, so Mario Mandzukic steps in for Milan in this head-to-head for Champions League places with Ciro Immobile’s Lazio.

It kicks off at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome at 19.45 UK time (18.45 GMT).

You can follow the build-up and action as it happens from this game and Torino-Napoli on the LIVEBLOG.

This is a big fixture for both clubs, as defeat would almost certainly rule Lazio out of the running for the top four, whereas anything less than a win would see Milan lose second place to Atalanta.

Ibrahimovic is still out injured after missing the 2-1 defeat to Sassuolo, so Mandzukic gets his first start in the Rossoneri jersey.

Theo Hernandez and Ismael Bennacer also missed the midweek game, but are passed fit to start.

Lazio are coming off a chaotic 5-2 defeat to Napoli that dented their European hopes, but they still have a game in hand to be played against Torino on May 18.

Lucas Leiva and Luis Alberto are not at their best, but grit their teeth to start anyway.

Felipe Caicedo, Gonzalo Escalante and long-term absentee Luiz Felipe are out of action, so Adam Marusic is confirmed as a defender.

Ciro Immobile is partnered by Joaquin Correa.

The big news for Lazio is the return of coach Simone Inzaghi, who had missed the last few games after testing positive for COVID.

When these sides met at San Siro in December, it was a dramatic 3-2 Milan victory in stoppages.

But just looking at some numbers, in my opinion buying Leao was a good decision and a step in the right direction for the club.  He currently make $1.4 mil/yr and has a contract until 2024. so far this season he has 6 goals and 5 assists, last season was 6 goals and 1 assist. By comparison:

 Castillejo: $1.5 mil/yr, 20/21 1 goal &amp; 0 assists, 19/20 2 goals &amp; 3 assists

Borini: $2.5 mil/yr, 19/20 3 goals &amp; 0 assists, 18/19 3 goals &amp; 1 assist

Kalinic: $3.5mil/yr, 17/18 6 goals &amp; 5 assists

I would pick him over these 3 any day. Bringing him in lowered our wage bill without sacrificing output. I tried to only include similar players as comparison, but seriously go look at some other players, Andrea Conti $2 mil/yr, Andre Silva $2 mil/yr, pepe reina $3 mil/yr, Ricardo Rodriguez $2.1 mil/yr, laxalt 2.1 mil/yr. 

He is the 12th or 13th highest paid player on the team and I think that's reasonable for him. I wish he would get more in the games and show a better work rate.

Leão posts a photograph of the underside of his sneaker, and he gets like 51 billion Likes within an hour. Hernandez posts a photograph showing the shape and quality of his recent faeces — juxtaposed with the Bristol stool chart — and he gets 45 quadrillion positive comments almost instantaneously, mostly drive-by emoji.

They are mercenaries. They don't give a third of a shit about our club, its history, its pedigree, or its future. It's all about the cake, the fame, the bright lights, cameras snapping away, red carpets, meretricious models (and groupies), more cake, bonuses, Lamborghinis, concierges, followers, ""reputation management"", overpaid entourages, yesmen, yeswomen, corporate endorsements, more cake, Moet, more cake, caviar, Honduran cigars, Gucci, lapidary luxury, gated communities, jacuzzied suites, more bimbos, pre-nuptials, adultery, photo opportunities, political aspirations, retarded coiffures, ~~money laundering and tax evasion~~ ""charity"", châteaux, yachts, making the *GQ*, *FHM*, and *Vanity Fair* covers, catwalks, favourable pre$s, video games, and maybe, just maybe, two or three title medals for the settee stories.

Why would they give a fifteenth of a fuck about **AC Milan**? You people place them on pedestals every single minute. 

Every fucking minute.

improb,1619012140.0,mvftc8,7.0,1.0,"I have been a fan of Milan (AC for Americans) ever since I was 5. I basically grew up with the team as my father was himself a huge fan. I fell in love with Shevchenko, I bought the first shirt after we won the Serie A in 2004. Cried myself to sleep after the nightmare that was Istanbul, screamed like a crazy after Kaka's goal against United in the 2007 semis and even more after winning the finals, getting our revenge against Liverpool. We went out with horns and paraded through the streets of my Southern Italian city, along with several other fans. Same year, I watched the Club World Cup at the local fan club and in 2009, I cried when Maldini player his last game. He was the soul of that team and we knew our golden era ended.

2010, I attended my first live game with my father (I had already watched minor league games but, you know, not Milan, not the team I grew up watching every week) and stood with the Curva and it was such a joy seeing Ronaldinho do his tricks, to scream my heart out as we won hoping to have a new great generation with Pato, Ibra, Robinho, Silva, ecc. We had a few good seasons before reverting to upper midtable but still, despite us being far from the success we had enjoyed when I was a little kid, I still loved the team. After all, it was the one thing who bonded me with my father despite our mostly bad relationship. It was the one thing who made all disagreements and family problems go away but then, ownership changed and football became more and more of a business, so much so that my father couldn't relate to the sport anymore and just quit watching games (with the odd exception) and way more slooowly, in the last three years so did I.

But now, it's my point of no return. I will always keep Milan in my heart but I can't support this shit. I can't support a team that clearly turned into a business. I can't support a sport where the masses, the average local fan, is left behind. I do love the sport but not the way it is now. It's time for fans to go against this money making machine, we can't let this slide because they will come back with this idea or a new format with the same premise till us fans will be tired and will just accept the situation.

We must strike now! We must strike against FAs, UEFA, FIFA because they allowed the sport to become what it is now. They created this monster and now they pretend they are the good guys. We must strike against the billionaire owners who treat football as something to gain even more money, we must fight to create a more sustainable model where every team can compete. A model where UCL money is equally distributed despite market size, where a few teams won't become too powerful. We must go back to the roots and to do so, we must support our local teams. A model where leagues aren't held hostage by a few teams and their sugardaddies who dictate everything.

I grew up with this team because I was fathered into it. The club and its philosophy belong to everyone but it's now clear, more than ever, that us fans must help our local teams grow too. That's how we can give birth a more sane football world. Just look at Southern Italian teams, milion of people in the area but apart from Napoli, not enough support to ever contend. Why? Because most of us have chased success, money instead of chasing of what bonds us to our cities or regions. Maybe, starting from down low, we can slowly create a 50+1 system outside of Germany too, one where the fans actually count and football is at its purest.

#Team news

According to the Pre-Match Conference, neither Ismael Bennacer nor Zlatan Ibrahimovic are doing well at the moment and are not at 100%, while the same can be said for Theo Hernandez and Hakan Calhanoglu. That could mean that the likes of Rafael Leao and Diogo Dalot get the nod again.

Davide Calabria will start at right-back with Simon Kjaer and Fikayo Tomori the centre-back pairing, meaning Alessio Romagnoli will be on the bench still. In the middle of the field, Pioli tried Franck Kessie and Soualiho Meité in Tuesday morning’s training.


#The opponents

Sassuolo have continued their reputation as being one of the most exciting teams to watch in Serie A, and their current standing of eighth place has certainly been earned. A Europa League place now appears out of reach as they are eight points behind Roma, though it has been a season of progress once again.

The Neroverdi come into the game off the back of two straight wins against Benevento and Fiorentina, but prior to that they had won 2 in 13 league games. Their defeats this season have come against the likes of Inter (x2), Milan, Juventus, Atalanta and Lazio, which shows that they are just short of taking that next step despite being second after eight games.

In terms of team news, reports suggest that striker and second-top scorer Francesco Caputo could still remain sidelined for Sassuolo, while Kaan Ayhan (COVID-19) and Filippo Romagna are expected to miss the game.

Domenico Berardi was back with a bang on Saturday as he scored twice and he is expected to start. Primavera product Giacomo Raspadori should start up top, while Manuel Locatelli is expected to come back into the XI too.

**Probable Milan XI (4-2-3-1): Donnarumma; Calabria, Kjaer, Tomori, Dalot; Meite, Kessie; Saelemaekers, Brahim Diaz, Rebic; Leao.**

**Probable Sassuolo XI (4-2-3-1): Consigli; Muldur, Chiriches, Ferrari, Kyriakopoulos; Lopez, Locatelli; Berardi, Djuricic, Boga; Raspadori**

Head to head

In 19 clashes between the sides, Milan have beaten Sassuolo 12 times, while losing on just five occasions, though fans will remember a time where the Emilia-Romagna side were somewhat of a bogey team when they first reached Serie A.

In their first meeting of the season, the Rossoneri managed to strike after just seven seconds thanks to Rafael Leao’s lightning finish from kick-off, and a second goal from Saelemaekers before the break rendered Berardi’s 89th-minute free-kick a mere consolation.

The same fixture last year produced a 0-0 draw in what was the 120th anniversary celebrations for Milan, while the return game saw Milan run out 2-1 winners thanks to a brace from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

**Match facts (via Opta):**

* Milan are unbeaten in their last nine Serie A games against Sassuolo (W7, D2), after having lost four of their previous six league meetings against the Neroverdi (W2).

* After conceding in each of their first five home games against Sassuolo in Serie A (W3, D1, L1), AC Milan have kept a clean sheet in their last two encounters against them at San Siro (W1 D1).

* Milan have won their last two Serie A games – the last time they enjoyed a longer such run was last January: on that occasion the run began with a win against Sassuolo.

* The last two Serie A games played by Milan on Wednesday were at San Siro: a defeat against Juventus and a draw against Udinese; the last time the Rossoneri played three league games in a row without winning on this day of the week was back in October 2009.

* Sassuolo won their last away league game, against Benevento; they could win consecutive away games in Serie A for their first time since last November, when they won four on the bounce.

* Milan (12) and Sassuolo (10) are the two sides to have scored the most penalties in Serie A this season; however, the last one scored by the Rossoneri was back on March 3rd and since then, the Neroverdi have netted four penalties.

* No side has scored more goals than Milan during the first 30 minutes of play in Serie A this season (21 goals, level with AS Roma).

* Among the players with 10+ goals in Serie A this season, Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has played the fewest games (15 goals in 17 matches).

* Ante Rebic has scored 17 goals in the second half of the season in the last two Serie A campaigns (out of 18 with Milan): excluding penalties, only Cristiano Ronaldo (18) has scored more in the last two campaigns considering only the second half of the season.

* Domenico Berardi has scored more Serie A goals against Milan than he has vs any other: the Sassuolo striker has scored nine league goals against the Rossoneri, including the only time he has netted four goals in a single game in the competition (in January 2014).",ACMilan,[Pre-Match Thread] A.C.

I have only a Milan fan for all my life and will alway be but i don't like the play off format. And these founding team don't risk nothing,win or lose is not the way to go. Do i want fifa or uefa to give more to the clubs? Yes of course and their threats of banning players or clubs is nothing more than the fear they have on loosing 80% of their fan base. But i will not jump into conclusions,i will wait and see, i am sure they will come to an agreement that will fill the pockets of both sides until they are happy because banning a player from their national team is more of a problem for fifa and uefa than is anything else from all this story. It will force some countries that have at least half of their first team players in this new league to maybe cut ties with fifa and uefa.

Every club will now be guaranteed a minimum of 10 league stage games against 10 different opponents (five home games, five away) rather than the previous six matches against three teams, played on a home and away basis.

The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout stage, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off to secure their path to the last 16 of the competition.

Similar format changes will also be applied to the UEFA Europa League (8 matches in the league stage) and UEFA Europa Conference League (6 matches in the league stage). Subject to further discussions and agreements, these two competitions may also be expanded to a total of 36 teams each in the league stage.

Qualification for the UEFA Champions League will continue to be open and earned through a team’s performance in domestic competitions.

One of the additional places will go to the club ranked third in the championship of the association in fifth position in the UEFA national association ranking. Another will be awarded to a domestic champion by extending from four to five the number of clubs qualifying via the so-called “Champions Path”.

The final two places will go to the clubs with the highest club coefficient over the last five years that have not qualified for the Champions League group stage but have qualified either for the Champions League qualification phase, the Europa League or the Europa Conference League.

All games before the final will still be played midweek, recognising the importance of the domestic calendar of games across Europe.

Samkazi23,1618926137.0,muql92,25.0,1.0,"After Genoa, it’s time for Sassuolo. Three days on from their match against Ballardini’s side, AC Milan will return to the San Siro pitch to face the Neroverdi on matchday 32 in Serie A. It’s a vital showdown, one which the Rossoneri need to win at all costs to maintain their current position in the league. On the eve of the match, Stefano Pioli spoke to the press, with his words being broadcast on the AC Milan Official App and Milan TV. 

GENOA
""We need to be focused and well-prepared. We’re heading into the game on the back of a difficult win, which should help us in terms of our conviction and mentality. We’ll be facing a side that thrives on preparing for such matches, they play a very modern and fast game. We’ll need to be ready to produce a high-quality performance that lives up to our expectations.""

AC MILAN’S CURRENT SITUATION
""We have a few problems and need to have a closer look at the conditions of Bennacer, Çalhanoğlu, Ibrahimović and Hernández. We’ll have a better understanding of how they’re doing tomorrow. The first two have knocks, while Zlatan and Theo are suffering from fatigue. I don’t think there’s been an overload of work, we’re not worried about this. Against Genoa, it wasn’t the best game on a technical or athletic level. Tomorrow will be a completely different match from a tactical point of view: there could be more space to play in.""

INDIVIDUALS
""Mandžukić did well when he entered the fray on Sunday, he provided us with a real presence and aggressiveness. He’s an intelligent player and, while he still won’t be able to play a full 90 minutes, I believe in him and think he’ll be able to lend us a big hand in the closing stages of the season. On a psychological level, Romagnoli went through a period where he struggled slightly because we played numerous matches. Now, he’s doing better, even if he’s not in absolute peak condition. However, he’s putting in the work to reach this. Donnarumma is calm and focused, which are the best characteristics to have going into the end of the season. While other things may be discussed on the outside, there are no other topics here: we focus on our work.""


FURTHER COMMENTS ON INDIVIDUALS
""Tonali is doing well but can do more. He’s made a big leap forward and also needed time to adapt to a new formation. He could play tomorrow. Hauge? I’m happy with him, it’s not the right time to talk about the future. We’re a great club and there’s heavy competition. Leão showed some excellent movement on Sunday. Sometimes, he focuses on the ball too much and loses sight of what exactly is happening around him. Given the characteristics that we have, constantly looking forward is essential for this team.""

OBJECTIVES
""In the last seven years, AC Milan have never finished in the top four. For us, it’s something that would demonstrate that there’s been continuity in terms of growth. Seven matches remain, and we’re focused on what’s coming up. It’s not the right time to talk about the future, and I’m not the best person to do so. Right now, we have the same number of points that we had at the end of last season. And that’s despite the fact we’ve played 13 matches in Europe, of which we lost just two. It’s clear that the team have grown. We must only focus on doing the maximum from now until the end.""

WHERE THE TEAM CAN GROW
""We control matches, but we can give the impression that we’re capable of losing from one moment to the next. We need to maintain control and not give our opponents hope that they can get back into it. We can do this by learning how to interpret certain moments of the game better. We like playing with intensity. Knowing how to dominate and, in particular, control matches is an aspect that we need to improve.""

gogobera,1618900760.0,mukh5e,2.0,1.0,"tl;dr: football we all love will never get back, with or without ESL or CL. But there is an attempt.

Do you remember what made you love football? Do you really understand how it unites people?

Let me tell you my story. 

I live with football, every day starts with a ball and ends up with the ball. I started watching it in the end of 90s, but I have watched the matches from the very past. 

In the past, players didn’t use to play for money, but love. They didn’t dream about money, but the full stadium of the fans on a World Cup. Their dream was to win with their national team and to make fans happy.

People in Brazil literally died in 1950 for football, guys. Search for “maracanazo”. It’s not only occasion. We remember Liverpool disaster and a lot more... These people lived for football and died for that. 

The picture I want to make is really hard to explain, it’s another topic, but what’s clear is that football may never be so beautiful as it used to be.

How many attempts to score do you see in a match in the modern football? You wait for 5 minutes to see them hit the target. Football is measured with a ruler today. Those who has a good statistic is a good player... Do you care how many passes you make in a game if those passes don’t create a danger in the box?

If Kaka played today, he wouldn’t be any good for some coaches. I remember, Ancelotti once said that Kaka was capable of playing modern football if he was young. What was the reason to explain this? Think about that...

Players become businessmen. Especially in the smaller teams. Don’t expect me to mention millionaires of elite clubs. What’s truth is that everywhere, they happen to become footballers for money... Good physics? Good money...

Where does this take us? - I don’t believe any fan dies for their club today. 

What to blame? 

It’s a hype. I think it’s a hype - “hey, they are killing the sport”. C'mon. You swear every match day that league is corrupted. UEFA and FIFA representatives are guilty for corruption, every year something new happens. When you have a monopoly, of course you don’t want to take it from you.

Do you believe Ceferin cares about people? or clubs? or beautiful games? 

They are both to blame!

2024 shit show was just announced by UEFA. They are clowns. They do exactly what they are blaming.

Some fans in the future won’t understand the old football. It will be natural to them. They will grow on this. Some people may don't know, but CL was founded in the same manner. Many people were against it. And you know what? CL that you watch today is way different than it used to be...

New leagues will never change what people think about sport, nor it makes it bad. The fact is that football has become boring especially in the recent years. That's because UEFA gave up on many occasions. If they didn't wanted clubs to have monopoly with their money, they should have take a move.

Don't believe what you hear today. NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO BAN PLAYERS FROM PLAYING IN THEIR NATIONAL TEAM. UEFA and FIFA are paying for this...

The ECL seems to be mess as it was with CL. Why is Tottenham the top club and not Aston Villa? What makes you an elite club. That's blurry an unsatisfactory, because of its subjectivity, but it will definitely change.

What you are watching now is an attempt to save football from UEFA and FIFA.",ACMilan,Unpopular opinion. My take on ECL,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/mukh5e/unpopular_opinion_my_take_on_ecl/,2021-04-20 14:39:20

ESL clubs still want to play their own nation's leagues and most definitely want their players to join the World Cup if possible. UEFA &amp; FIFA should be questioned for those problems.

Clubs pay players salaries, clubs provide their players to the national teams, and even the stadium that UCL uses are mostly provided by clubs. 

What did UEFA do? They didn't even invent UCL, they were against it at first and then took it once they saw the benefit it could bring to them. Plus they do made some shit rules like FFP.

From the founding members PoV:

I guess regardless of ethics it makes sense from financial point of view and this is one of the major factors driving these clubs. Based on what Agnelli said they believe that teams like Atalanta, Porto and others with relatively low fan following feed on the revenue of CL which is contributed mostly due to popularity of these big clubs. Same goes for dom league as well.
Secondly in one off matches the possibility of a team like porto to knock out a Juve is high but extremely difficult for them to finish ahead of them in a league format.

From Fans PoV:

This I am sure is different for each and every one of us but putting my point. I really feel this is a dick move by the clubs but if I get a midweek match where Liv is facing Barca and Real Madrid is facing AC Milan I would definitely be much more interested than a Roma vs Crotone. In short if it does happen eventually I am going to watch the game where the highest quality of football is in display.

From Non Founding members PoV:

I think this is like a stab in the guts for them, their dream of becoming a top club ends with this league so there really is no other PoV here I guess.

In their statements they are claiming to want to continue in their domestic leagues and are offering to continue consolidarity payments to the domestic federations. If that is true, (and I understand it might just be lipservice) then the domestic federations would actually earn more money assuming they dont try and kick the teams out of their domestic leagues and ruin their own revenue streams in the process as they would then be in breach of all their existing media contracts and would be liable for the brodcasters losses. 

Seems to me like these teams who are the best in the world at marketing and negotiating are tiered of having UEFA (a well known corrupt entity) poorly negotiate and market their rights deals, and taking a share of the money. UEFA isn't this upset because of tradition or becaise the state of the game is in danger... they want money, and this removes their power over the big clubs.

Lets be honest with ourselves. If UEFA and FIFA really cared about futbol or fans then they wouldn't have a world cup in Qatar... with stadiums built by modern day slaves, while currently under hostile embargoes with almost every nation in the region and interrupting the domestic leagues and tournaments to host the tournament in winter for the forst time ever because player safty couldn'tbe promised if the games were played in the summer.  Traditions tossed out, crimes against humanity and indangering the athletes... all in ONE tournament. Why is that money grab less outrageous then this one?

Also each of the founding teams are rumored to be given €4.5 BILLION each just for signing on early. And Merda doesn't get any of that... Yeah sign me up.",ACMilan,I'm not seeing this as absolutely guaranteed to be a bad thing...,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/mtsboa/im_not_seeing_this_as_absolutely_guaranteed_to_be/,2021-04-19 11:41:09

I've cried out of happiness and rage so many times. I still remember shouting to my uncle's face with tears pouring out of my eyes when Pato scored first minute goal vs Barcelona and then late equalizer from Thiago. I remember 4-0 win vs Arsenal and how on top of the world it made me feel. Then the nail baiting 3-0 return leg, I was watching it in my bed. I couldn't make any noise or I'd wake everybody up. I remember that night like it was yesterday - sweating, biting my fingers, scratching my face and covering my mouth. When we won the only scudeto, that I remember clearly, I was so happy that nothing else mattered even though a lot of shit happened that year. And now we come to 2021. I've waited for my Milan to return to UCL for 7 years. So many disappointing moments, we got close so many times (IF ONLY THE EMPOLI FUCKERS COULD SCORE TAP INS VS INTER IN THE LAST FIXTURE) and we never lost hope. And now when it is finally here, when we have gone through everything and its finally in our hands we just let it go. It breaks me. It really does. This past 2 years have been so fucking terrible for me, I don't know where I'd be without this Milan team, this squad that gave me something to look forward to every week.

The former Palermo man came close to scoring his first goal in a red and black shirt and performed a goal-line clearance in the final minutes.

With Zlatan Ibrahimovic suspended, Rafael Leao played as a centre-forward with Rebic in support.

“Rebic is more of a support striker who moves towards the centre rather than on the wing. He does that with Leao, Ibrahimovic and anyone else. He scored a great goal today with remarkable technique.”

Pioli was asked if Milan will continue to have the same attitude even after missing out on the Scudetto.

“I think we’ve let go of the Scudetto for the last three or four games already. Inter won too many matches and are too far ahead to be challenged now.

“It would be extraordinary and wonderful for Milan to get into the Champions League again. I saw a statistic that said we are one of the teams in the top European leagues with the youngest average age, but most of the others aren’t even in the top 10, whereas we are second in a very difficult league like Serie A.

“There are very tough games coming up with Sassuolo, Atalanta, Lazio, so we need to keep pushing.”

Samkazi23,1618668331.0,msrcnt,6.0,1.0,"[From Parma to Genoa, from the Tardini to San Siro, where the Rossoneri need to taste victory once again. Most of our games from now until the end of the season will be played at home. On Sunday 18 April at 12:30 CEST, the Rossoneri will host the Grifone on matchday 31 in Serie A. Stefano Pioli held his pre-match press conference ahead of the game today, with the Coach having the following to say:](https://www.acmilan.com/en/news/articles/press-conference/2021-04-17/pioli-our-future-is-the-present)

* **AC MILAN V GENOA**

""Genoa are a complete, physical side. They’re not a team that plays possession-based football: they go for a more direct approach instead. Genoa are doing well, also thanks to their new coach. Scamacca is a very promising youngster with well-defined characteristics, but they have other strong attackers.""

* **WINNING AT SAN SIRO**

""We want to return to winning ways at San Siro, a win at home has been missing for a while now. We need to produce a high-quality display where we make precise choices. We’ve analysed our home fixtures in detail, and often we haven’t done very well in the final quarter of the pitch, including in terms of the conviction we’ve shown. It’s in that part of the field that matches are decided. We’ll need to be attentive and determined, while our approach will have to be more aggressive and intense. Taking the lead is something which can make the difference.""

* **THE PARTIAL REOPENING OF STADIUMS**

""We can’t wait to see our fans inside the stadium again. Football is all about passion and enthusiasm. It was important for us even when only 1000 supporters were allowed in previously. We really noticed it when this changed again. We hope that our fans will be able to attend again soon because they could give us strength and bring excitement.""


* **THE TEAM**

""The team have been very focused: they’ve done everything to prepare for tomorrow’s match in the best possible fashion. Every game is a test. Our future is now: we must only think about the pitch, the Club will take care of the rest. There’s too much talk about other things. We’re aiming to qualify for the Champions League, an objective that hasn’t been achieved for several years. We’re halfway up the climb, we can’t raise our heads but have to continue pedalling hard. We mustn’t expend energy on other matters, including refereeing decisions. The referees in Italy are excellent, and mistakes can happen. Perhaps the absence of spectators has complicated things.""

* **MARIO MANDŽUKIĆ**

""I’m happy that he’s feeling fine. While he doesn’t have 90 minutes in his legs, he’s enjoyed an excellent week of work. Not being available in the past few months has been hard for him, but he’s always behaved as a great professional. Giving up his March salary is confirmation of the values he possesses on both a moral and technical level. He will be very useful to us.""

* **INDIVIDUALS**

""In terms of his desire and decisiveness, Leão has made great strides forward in his day-to-day work and during matches. Knowing how to come on and decide matches is an important quality. Thanks to their movement, and also with the characteristics of the opposition in mind, Leão and Rebić could be very dangerous. Kessie has become a complete player, he knows how to stitch play together and has improved in terms of his ball distribution. He’s reached a very high level but can still grow. Tomori has had a great impact. Ibrahimović has been attentive and fully involved. Dalot has always trained very well, just like the rest of his teammates. Whether he plays or not depends on the choices that are made.""",ACMilan,"Pioli:""We want to return to winning ways at San Siro, a win at home has been missing for a while now...

Samkazi23,1617971321.0,mng4fq,1.0,1.0,"AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli has spoken in the press conference today ahead of the game opposing the Rossoneri to Parma this Saturday in Serie A. Here are his words:

On Parma:

“Tomorrow’s match only counts. I don’t like the concept of ‘9 matches left’. What counts is tomorrow’s match which will be played to the best of our ability and better than the one against Sampdoria. They will be a difficult opponent, who plays quickly and with quality.“

On this week:

“One of the things I appreciate about my team is that we are so focused on our goals is that we are very disappointed when we fail to perform at the same level. We know what the mistakes are and we know which ones we don’t have to repeat.“

On the conditions of Calabria and Manzdukic:

“Davide has done everything he has to won on the pitch. He has shown great willingness and intelligence. Sorry he is still out, but he is better and should be back next week. Mario was unlucky but he is a great man and a great professional. He’s not at his best yet but he can give us a lot in these outings.“

On mistakes against Sampdoria:

“There’s a little bit of everyone in what didn’t work last Saturday, but we can’t just think about what we didn’t manage to do, but tomorrow’s game counts. If we are good at maintaining the average points held so far. we can close at 80 points. Tomorrow we know how complicated it is.“

On whether Milan can handle the pressure:

“Absolutely yes. We have passed many steps in this year and a half and we did it mentally. Tomorrow’s game will have to see us on the pitch with a great desire to do well and [with] intensity.“

On coming back after going down in the game:

“The mental aspect of the game can change. Going ahead can build confidence. We need quality and rhythm and when we don’t have it we struggle. The approach matters a lot.“

On whether would he like to overtake Allegri after Gattuso:

“I’m fine here with Milan, club and property. We are working well to bring Milan back to normal, to the Europe that matters. I’m fine here and I can make an impact in improving the club and the players.“

On players who have not renewed yet:

“I see them calm and focused, it’s normal that you have to wait for the final result when there are negotiations, but here we only think about tomorrow’s match. All the players are focused on our goal.“

On the form of Romagnoli, Diaz and Leao:

“If yesterday’s situations are confirmed today, the only ones not called up will be Calabria, Romagnoli and Maldini. The others are all available for Parma.“

On whether the Scudetto word lead to any unexpected results:

“You just said it, we are focused on the field. Then the words take the wind“.

On whether Hauge could be aligned on the right-wing tomorrow:

“Hauge I think his position is on the left, where he performs best. I don’t want to put players not in the ideal conditions to perform at their best. Diaz could play on the right and it could be a possibility.“

On Theo’s drop of form in 2021:

“He had played an excellent match in Florence. Last Saturday he ran into a bad day. I saw a focused player this week and I expect a positive game from him.“

On whether would he like tomorrow’s match to be his last:

“The championship ends on May 23. We are aware that there are many games missing and we are focused on this. We have no fears or anxieties. I see the desire to reach the goal and to play for Milan.“

On whether he is looking more to play or to get the result:

“Each coach and each team has its own identity. We play and try to play well to get the victory, which is the main thing, then everyone gets there as they see fit. We have our way of playing, our players feel good in the way we play“.

On how does he plan to get around the high pressing of Parma:

“The Italian championship is stimulating because there are so many different teams. We are ready for anything. We must not make the same mistakes as Sampdoria, that is not to go deep. We must be able to read spaces well and be fast both with the ball and without the ball.“

On recovering almost all the players who were out:

“It means increasing the level of quality and rhythm in training, in the possibility of choosing. I hope it will always be like this from now to the end. We have more ideas both from the beginning and during the game. Having more solutions is always positive.“

On the problems up front:

“We have to make better choices, we miss the last step, the right dribbling which then are the choices that determine the final result“.",ACMilan,"Pioli: “Tomorrow’s match only counts. I don’t like the concept of ‘9 matches left’. What counts is tomorrow’s match which will be played to the best of our ability and better than the one against Sampdoria. They will be a difficult opponent, who plays quickly and with quality.“ | Pre Match Quotes",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/mng4fq/pioli_tomorrows_match_only_counts_i_dont_like_the/,2021-04-09 20:28:41

Hass_s,1617894940.0,mmtzuc,12.0,1.0,"The summer transfer window will soon arrive, and considering how restricted we would be financially, even if we do make it to the Champions league, we will have to search for options that can provide an impact but don't cost a lot in terms of transfer fees. 

Ideally, free agents would be something to look at, but the options that are available don't inspire a lot of confidence and many players won't offer much of an improvement to our current crop. While other free agents would demand high wages or transfer bonuses which deem them unrealistic. 

We have been previously linked with some of these free agents in the past, mainly : 

J**ulian Draxler , Memphis Depay, Lucas Vazquez, Elseid Hysaj, Nikola Maksimovic, Aissa Mandi, Jordan Amavi , Nikolas N'Koulou, and Florian Thauvin.** 

Granted some of these names were linked from lower tier sources, but as mentioned above, the array of choices is not exciting, so I thought I'd have a look at contracts expiring in 2022, to see if there are some gems that we can sign for a lower fee and that can help improve our squad. 

I'll just be listing the names and positions, and people here could argue for/against them as they wish.

On Ibra:

“He is great, we had a great time together. Upon my arrival he told me to commit myself and enjoy it because Milan is a club with an important history. He told me to work hard and fit in well with the group“.

On Haaland:

“We talked a lot, we know each other very well. There were many clubs who were interested in me. I talked to him about Milan and he recommended it to me. He told me it would be tough, but that I would be fine“.

On the possible arrival of Haaland in Italy in the future:

“I think he would have all the qualities to play in Italy, he would be very happy here because he is very strong and fast“.

georgedavidrs,1617868132.0,mmmr5k,147.0,1.0,"I'm curious as to who thinks we should sign next season to play alongside Ibra. It's pretty obvious Mandzukic was an unlucky experiment, and we def need Ibra if we'll play in 3 competitions next season. 

For me the ideal candidate would be Tammy Abraham for a variety of reasons: 

1) Still pretty young and can develop

2) We could loan him with an option of around 40, especially if Chelsea are trying to get Haaland and need the funds.

3) Hopefully Tomori stays and he can help convince over other mid table english teams.

4) For our gameplay, a tall and clinical striker ( like Ibra) is needed and he fits the bill, along with a decent amount of pace.

&amp;#x200B;

If we are to loan him, hopefully we can use the remainder of our budget to strengthen other areas.

On his culinary passion: 

“After coffee, I have a great passion, making bread at home. You have to stay on the dough a lot, observe it, see how it grows, there are many steps before putting it in the oven. It is a joy for me ”.

On his haircut: 

“I wanted to try a long cut, but it didn’t fit as well as I thought. I didn’t have the volume I wanted so I cut them out. My wife is very happy (laughs, ed)”.

Is your wife in charge at home? 

“No (laughs, ed). It was my choice. I didn’t have volume and so I decided to cut them“.

On how does he feel in Milano: 

“Very well, I like to stay in such a house with this garden, it is also better for children”.

On the call from Milan: 

“It is one of the greatest teams in the world, I had satisfaction. The real joy, however, was when I signed the contract”.

Who called you? And how was your first day at Milanello? 

“I was called by my agent with Maldini and Massara. Then it’s always nice when you discover a new sports center. Milanello is very very nice”.

On who is the most competitive in training: 

“I can’t just say one, we are all competitive. We all want to win, it’s bad to say that only one is competitive”.

On which part of the house that he lives in the most: 

“My children’s kitchen and playroom”.

On whether has he ever cooked for his mates: 

“No, only once when I was playing at Nantes I made coffee for the whole team with my machine“.

On other sports: 

“I like tennis and American football“.

Samkazi23,1617822719.0,mm9iwx,2.0,1.0,"**AC Milan midfielder Rade Krunic has granted an excluisve interview to Milan TV and Sky. Here are his statements:**

On his use:

“I was always available to the team and the coach, even to play in different roles. I was always available. I think that in this second part of the season I played a little more in the last few games because there were so many players injured. By playing more I showed my qualities and what I can give to the team.“

On the victory with his goal in Verona:

“It was a very important match for us, there were many players unavailable and in the previous match we had not won. For me it means a lot, it helped me a lot to do better in the following matches“.

On the double confrontation in the Europa League against Manchester United:

“I think we deserved to go through, we did very well in England but also at home. A draw without a goal was enough to pass. We did well, we lacked a bit of luck but I’m proud of the team and how we played.“

On the moment of form:

“We have to go back to being us, with that grit and determination that we showed at the beginning. In the last few games we have not been at our level but we must do things as we did before, with quality and determination. Now we have more time to prepare for the matches and rest. In my opinion it is a very important thing, the team has been playing for a long time every 3 days and it is not an easy thing. Now we have to rest mentally and prepare for the next match. One victory in Parma is enough. and we will be Milan as before.“

On the many absences:

“A few times we have all been available, all healthy and ready to give our best. Now slowly everyone is returning and for the last part of the season it will be even more important to have the whole group available“.

On the match against Sampdoria:

“There is no excuse for a match like this, these matches must be won. There is no fatigue. The coach always says things as they are, both to you and to us, and we will improve things in we made a mistake. We hope to get back to winning in the next match.“

On the next match against Parma:

“We do not underestimate anyone. The coach has not spoken about Parma yet, but he will certainly say the same things. We cannot underestimate a team that is fighting for salvation. In my opinion they had no luck in the last match. but they did well and it seems to me that they are growing. But we are Milan and we have to win again.“

**To Sky:**


*“We weren’t good at managing the match, we didn’t look like the usual Milan. It reminded me of the match against Spezia, it seemed [like] we didn’t want to win. A tough game awaits us now, after the missteps at home we have always managed to win away. If a success comes in Parma the definitive turning point could come. We are second and we have everything in the our hands. I understand the fans who are afraid after so many years without Champions but we are calm and we will certainly give our best.""*",ACMilan,"Krunic: ""There is no excuse for a match like this (against Sampdoria), these matches must be won. There is no fatigue. The coach always says things as they are, both to you and to us, and we will improve things in where we made mistakes.

HommoFroggy,1617476326.0,mjets5,60.0,1.0," I Will start this post by giving very simple and straightforward answers to the post-match thread's most common questions and comments. 

1) **Why did Krunic start instead of Rebic?** Rebic came from a long stop, very simple... from an athletic point of view, Pioli knows better.

2) **Why didn't Hauge and Rebic start from the beginning?** Already answered about Rebic, when it comes to Hauge... reflect your selves. I don't think anyone before the match ended wanted Hauge who has been criticized for being underwhelming for some time. #whathappenedtoHauge

3) Why didn't Kalulu start. Because he hasn't convinced simple enough. Alexis did a decent match as a right-back under pressure for [28 minutes](https://understat.com/match/15712) in that right flank( *because as you can see in the second table of the link... Samp played only 28 minutes*), bar one scenario in the 21st minute from Augello.  Kalulu had again a decent match but at that point. Samp didn't attack anymore and got a red card, defensively he didn't have to have to do anything. [Here you have Kalulu's attacking output.](https://ibb.co/j4wHphj) Zero out of 7 crosses being successful and 0 key passes. So pretty much from a defensive point of view the idea of Pioli to start both Samu and Alexis was almost successful. [As you can see here except for](https://ibb.co/sgsMrDG)[ that single chance with Augello, nothing has happened in the right flank. Samp's](https://ibb.co/sgsMrDG)[ game was dominant in the left one.](https://ibb.co/sgsMrDG) **As one can argue that we could have done better offensively with Kalulu and Sale, another can argue that we also would have done worst defensively with Kalulu and Sale.** 

I don't see this ""disaster class"" of Pioli by that move that has conditioned the game as some of the people have said. Did Samu have individual mistakes in build-up?! **YES!** But at the end of the day, I fail to recognize one single player that hasn't done individual mistakes or could have done better as far as individual quality goes. I will not start mentioning here who made individual mistakes and how many, I am sure that every one of the people reading this will remember a bunch of individual mistakes from every player. 

Saying this, how does Sampdoria play?! How did they play against us in the first leg? Sampdoria is the traditional team that uses crosses, set pieces, builds with long balls to the midfielders or attackers. [Here there are the chances created by Samp in the first leg of Serie A.](https://understat.com/match/15522) As you can see everything that created in the first leg was from either:

a) from set-pieces 

b) with crosses 

c) shots from outside the box 

d) only one shot with La Gumina from inside the box out of 9 shots

[Here you have the type of chances that Sampdoria has](https://understat.com/match/15712)[ created today.](https://understat.com/match/15712) They again fall in the same 4 categories:

a) from set-peaces

b) with corners 

c) shots from outside the box 

d) only a single shot from Augello from inside the box out of 6 shots

For more clarification on this look at Sampdorias key passes spreadsheet [here](https://ibb.co/NsXZhyB). As you can see 4 key passes 3 made by the fullbacks and only one Quagliarella. 

**How does Sampdoria build up?** [Here](https://ibb.co/p67Xb09), it is Audero's stats, as you can see he has attempted 23 long balls. Also [here](https://ibb.co/hVrJZF1), you can see that Samp has attempted 32 long balls almost 2c as many as us in the first half, has tried 14 crosses almost 3 times more than us in the first half alone, and has won almost 2c as many headers as us in the first half alone. 

**Where did Samp build up?** [As you can see here again...](https://ibb.co/sgsMrDG) that is on our left side. We had Kessie and Tomori on our left side while Samp had Thorsbey(189 cm tall) and Gabbiadini(186 cm tall) on their right side which corresponds to our left side. On their left side which mirrors our right side, they had Quagliarella(180 cm) and Adrien Silva(175cm). How did Kessie and Tomori deal with that? [Tomori](https://ibb.co/WBFMvjh) has won 4 out of 8 aerial duels this match in the 90 minutes. But in half time he had won [1 out of 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/mj52vs/match_thread_ac_milan_vs_sampdoria_serie_a_round/gt8hvny?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). (*PS: I don't have a better source but my comment corresponds at half time because I was curious about that fact*) I don't need much to convince people that he isn't great in the air at the end of the day. [Kessie](https://ibb.co/CtDbsHp) as well has won 5 out of 8 aerial duels this match, but I could also think that this stat is boosted by the second half.  [Bennacer](https://ibb.co/MhFdz22) also on the other side has failed to win a single header in today's game. While [Kjaer](https://ibb.co/7nqXS37) has won 2 out of 2 headers today. This last stat pretty much shows us where Ranieri instructed his players to send the ball. 

As we have established how Sampdoria builds up, now we can express what brand of the game this build-up favors...  It favors playing for second balls to create chances, counters, and profiting from our mistakes if it isn't for set pieces and corners. To illustrate this let's go to [this](https://understat.com/match/15712) if you can go to the 3d page of the link which says ""stats"". There is something called **passes**, it reflects passes completed into the final third excluding crosses, as you can see, Samp has completed 4 passes in the final third all game. So how we dealt with second balls?! Let's go back to [this table](https://ibb.co/hVrJZF1). As we can see in the first half we have won 24 duels to 32 duels of Samp. The disparity could even be deeper considering those 28 minutes of the game that Samp dominated. 

Establishing all of these, we gifted 28 minutes to Sampdoria but we didn't concede. We shoot our self with as mentioned earlier **individual mistakes**. If we didn't gift Sampdoria 28 minutes we could have entered the pitch with more confidence and played again with more confidence throughout the match. More confidence means fewer individual mistakes even if one might argue certain players looked tired. When one team has confidence, the opposition has less confidence and is more afraid thus more error-prone. 

Now that I have made all the analysis on why we suffered for 28 minutes, i ""blame"" Pioli for not adapting to a particular playstyle that Samp. More muscle and CM were needed in this match to not gift the opposition 28 minutes which set the tone and the vibe of the game.",ACMilan,"Ac Milan vs Sampdoria Full Analysis, what went wrong in the first 28 minutes",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/mjets5/ac_milan_vs_sampdoria_full_analysis_what_went/,2021-04-04 02:58:46

Samkazi23,1617368995.0,mik1pd,15.0,1.0,"AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli has spoken in the press conference earlier today ahead of the game opposing AC Milan to Sampdoria this Saturday in Serie A. Here are his statements:

* **On whether responsibilities increase at this stage:**

“We have always taken responsibility with great conviction and trust. There comes a decisive moment, all we have done so far is to be here right now. All the games will be difficult and we have to give our best, we want to get to the end of the season without regrets, playing for Milan“.

* **On how the players are doing after these two weeks:**

“If I could, I would have given everyone holidays, we needed this break. The five forward players who remained are fine, those who returned from the national team are back in good condition, except Brahim Diaz who has problems and we will evaluate him tonight”

* **On tomorrow’s game:**

“We totally believe in what we do. Serenity, trust is our way of working. Ten games are a lot, the fight will be very hard, we have to think about tomorrow’s match. It is important, difficult, against a team motivated and trained by a great coach, I respect him because he was the coach who gave me the most in my coaching career.”

* **On the renewal situation:**

“The serenity I see in the eyes of Zlatan, Calha, Gigio, the players who are negotiating the renewal. Their future is now for us, it would change everything for us to go or not to go to the Champions League, I see a lot of concentration and attention”

* **On how many points are missing for the Champions League:*""

“We still have a lot of points to score. 75 could be the right threshold, but it is difficult to calculate.”

* **On the difference between home and away:**

“Our home numbers are significantly lower than away numbers. This is why it becomes important to return to winning in our stadium.”

* **On injuries:**

“Tomorrow we will not have everyone available, we are still far from what I would like. We hope to get close as early as the next one, we want to have no regrets and we believe that the ten matches must be played with great decision“.

* **On Ibra:**

“Ibra is fine, we felt like we were with the others on a daily basis. He is happy to be back in the national team and available with us. He did two high level training sessions, he arrived in very good condition. Everything is fine“.

* **On whether Bennacer and Kessie will be back together:**

“We must have rhythm in the game, try to be compact when the opponents are in possession and move a lot with the ball. Isma in reading the spaces and in verticalising is an important player for us.”

* **On Hauge:**

“He had a physical tarnish but it is physiological, he arrived when the season in Norway was about to end and he was more brilliant for the others. In these two days I have seen him in good condition“.

* **On the future of Tomori:**

“We are very satisfied with how he has entered, he is a handsome smiling boy, he gives us important characteristics. We must continue to do well, without thinking about the future. We have to think about tomorrow’s game, it will be complicated, the stops take away some preparation to the game. Let’s focus on this game and then we’ll think about the future.”

* **On the physical condition in this season finale:**

""The team is doing well, they arrive at the right time with the right condition. Fiorentina’s performance was very important in terms of character, against a good opponent. We tried to play the game and get it back. We have to make a strong performance above all. from a mental point of view. I don’t think of a perfect game. It will be a game where we will have to work a lot.”

* **On the team talking about the Scudetto:**

“The team has to think like this, God forbid you think negatively, then we know very well that we have to turn hopes into convincing performances, winning is difficult, but the team must go out on the pitch with confidence and awareness“.

* **On the management’s say about renewals:**

“I have daily contacts with the management, we are focused on tomorrow’s game and on the next ones, we will think about the future later“.

* **On what can make a difference tomorrow:**

“In matches, qualities make the difference and motivations. We will be motivated and they too, will want to show that they are up to it. They change their skin often, with excellent players and an excellent coach. A complicated match awaits us.”

* **On how to counteract the speed of Sampdoria:**

“Sampdoria verticalizes a lot, even in the defensive phase it waits, sometimes it comes to get you. We have to read the situations carefully during the match, there will be spaces and we will have to exploit them.”

* **On Milan winning for the first time after being disadvantaged against Fiorentina:**

“It was an important performance, the confirmation of the growth of this team, it is normal to have difficulties but you have to continue to believe in it, this allows you to win with important qualities“.

* **On whether does he like the name “Milan of the surprises”:**

“I think it can be correct, but every speech must be re-evaluated on May 23 at the end of the last day. To date I think Milan are one of the surprises of the championship, with Europe more than last year, we have 17 points more. We postpone the judgments to the end of the year, hoping to have the best possible“.

&amp;#x200B;

However, next season's Champions league promises to deliver one of the most competitive group stages in recent history. With us being back to the competition and ranked at **Pot 4** due to our prolonged absence and poor results in European competitions 

&amp;#x200B;

As things stand, Pots 1 and 2 are sealed, with 5 teams confirmed in pot 3 

Obviously our main target for the season would be to make it out of the group stages and not crash and burn like merda. With our standings and the pots so far, that might be a difficult case as luck might not be on our side and we might be placed in a group of death 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a look at the confirmed teams so far 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Pot 1 |Pot 2 |Pot 3|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chelsea |Real Madrid |Porto|
|Villareal |Barcelona |Ajax|
|Inter Milan|Sevilla |Atalanta |
|Manchester City |Juventus |RB Leipzig |
|Atlético Madrid |Liverpool |Zenit Saint Petersburg |
|Bayern Munich |Manchester United ||
|Lille |Borussia Dortmund ||
|Sporting CP|Paris Saint-Germain ||

&amp;#x200B;

With the following teams waiting for the qualifications round to finish to know if they make it to pot 3

**Confirmed qualified and might be pot 3 or 4** 

\- Besiktas  (49) 

\- Dynamo Kyiv  (47)

\- Club Brugge (35.5) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Will Play qualifying rounds** 

\- Dinamo Zagreb 

\- Olympiacos

\- Slavia Prague 

\- Shakhtar Donetsk

\- Benfica 

\- Monaco 

\- Red Bull Salzburg

This is my second summer as a Milanista. First, I’d like to thank everyone on this subreddit for offering a welcoming community to new faces like me. Making CL is great, but understanding the history of the club and its current context with your help has made this season even more special. I see myself as a lifelong fan, now.

As for the post’s actual purpose:

I’m not Italian, and as I said I’m kind of new here, so I have little experience with wading through the sea of sports news surrounding the transfer market and picking out what’s good information. I understand the tier flair system on the sub, but I’ve seen sources elsewhere that I can’t figure out whether or not they’re trustworthy.

Are there any outlets that are definitely *not* trustworthy? Anything equivalent to a sports tabloid? I’d like to contribute to discussion here better by being well-informed, so I’d like help with this.

BlackWolf_22,1622278127.0,nnj8b6,27.0,1.0,"Ok guys, these days I was thinking what our summer transfer market will look like and so I tried to write down the one I would do.
I tried to be quite realistic, so there aren’t big big names (this means no Dybala-Donnarumma swap for example, as I heard somewhere).

OBJECTIVES
First, the players we need. I think we all agree that we have to buy a RW and a ST. I also think that we have to take a true LB who can play when Theo isn’t 100% and improve our midfield, idk but I guess replacing Kessie with Meité in a CL game against Barcelona or PSG  isn’t really gonna help us go through the competition. 

BUDGET 
I put a budget of 60 millions euros, since we’re going to get 40+ M from the CL and nearly 20M from our 2nd place in Serie A.

GOALKEEPER: we’ve taken Maignan and we’re likely to sign Mirante, this mean Tatarusanu is going to leave. As for the third one, Plizzari is gonna come back from his loan, so I’d keep him.

RB: not much to do here, Calabria is our starter, I’d try to keep Dalot on loan with a 20M option to buy clause, otherwise we have Kalulu who can do a good job. Also, we sell Conti somewhere for 7M.

CB: we definitely buy Tomori, then I’d keep Caldara who’s coming back from Atalanta as fourth. Kjaer, Romagnoli and Gabbia all stay. Also, Duarte is likely to be redeemed by Basaksehir, so that’s 6 more millions for us.
 
LB: Laxalt is coming back, but I’d sell him somewhere for 5M. I’d try instead to get Ait Nouri from Wolverhampton. Actually he belongs to Angers, this season he was on loan with a 20M option to buy clause, but I’ve read the Wolves aren’t sure wether they can afford him or not. If they don’t, I’d take him with the same system (loan+20M option), otherwise we let Dalot play on the left as we did this year.

CM: Kessie and Bennacer OBVIOUSLY stay. We redeem Tonali but not Meite. I’d sell Krunic for 10M and call Pobega back. Then I’d try to talk with Chelsea to get Baka again. They don’t want him, I think there won’t be big problems to take him on a loan with a 15M option to buy clause.

RW: here is where we have to improve the most. Castillejo isn’t that bad, but between him and Saelemaekers he’s the one I’d sell ( he has some suitors in Spain, I think we can get something near 18M from him, maybe in a 15M+3M bonus form). The one I'd buy is Pedro Gonçalves from Sporting. He has just won the Portugese league with his club and scored 23 goals, with also 4 assists. His value is around 15M, but Sporting always asks a lot more for their players. I think we may make a deal like 15M now + 10M bonus. Regarding the salary, I found that he earns less than 1M there, so I think we can convince him easily to come if we give him 1,5/2M per year.

CAM: maybe some people here disagree with me, but I’d renew Hakan. He’s discontinuous, but losing him for free would be too painful, especially after Donnarumma. I’d also renew Diaz’s loan (with a 20M option).

LW: Rebic, Leao, Hauge, we’re good here.

ST: here we have to take someone who can alternate with our God Zlatan, and I think the perfect player is Belotti. He’s milanista, he knows Serie A, he’s in his prime age (he’s 27), but most important his contract expires next year and he won’t renew, this means big discount. Torino is asking 30M, I think we can get away with 25M. 

FINANCES:
Player: fee; gross salary

NB:
/ means that we won’t earn or pay more as the salary was already paid by the club where the player was on loan
DC means Decreto Crescita, so the gross salary decreases by 25% (if a player earns 5M, the club pays 7,5M instead of 10M)

Out: 
Donnarumma G:	 0; +12 M
Donnarumma A:	0; +2M
Tatarusanu: 0; +2M
Conti:	+7 M; 	/
Duarte: +6 M	; /
Laxalt:	+5 M;	/
Meite: 0; +2 M
Castillejo:	+18 M; +3 M
Krunic: +10 M; +2 M
Mandzukic: 0; +3,5 M

(+70,5M)

In:
Maignan: -15	; -4,5 (DC)
Mirante: 0; -2M
Plizzari: 0	; -0,5
Caldara: 0; -2
Tomori: -28; 	/
Nouri: 0; -4 M
Tonali: -25; /
Bakayoko: 0; - 4 M
Pobega: 0; -0,5
Pedro Goncalves: -15 M; -2,5M (DC)
Belotti: -25 M; -6M

(-132M)

TOT: -1,5M

CONCLUSION: here’s what our squad would look like.

Maignan (Mirante)

Calabria (Dalot)
Tomori (Caldara)
Kjaer (Romagnoli)
Theo (Nouri)

Kessie (Bakayoko)
Bennacer (Tonali)

Gonçalves/Saelemaekers (depends on the type of match we want to play)
Calhanoglu (Diaz)
Rebic (Leao)

Ibra (Belotti)

So, seeing what is happening these past couple of days with Inter I cant help but get ""let the banter era begin"" feeling about Inter.   
They are basically in the same spot we were back in the 2010/2011:

* Title winners - *check*
* Ending rivals winning streak - *check*
* Aging team - *check*
* Unsustainable wage structure - *check*
* Sell your star ST + CB (Lukaku and Bastoni) - *pending*

Add to that questions about solvency of their ownership and you get basically 2010/2011 Milan.

Samkazi23,1622133540.0,nmbjd2,9.0,1.0,"**The president of Milan Paolo Scaroni was a guest during the ""Lo sport checome"" event of ""Il Foglio Sportivo"". Below is the full speech by the Rossoneri president:**

**How did you spend the last week?** 

“I spent a week of great happiness and joy. But just as we didn't get down on difficult days, we don't get excited when things go too well, this is Milan's style and mine "".

**On the qualification of Milan for men and women in the Champions League:** 

“It wasn't in the plans. We are particularly happy with our women's team which is the first time they qualify for the Champions League, we are excited for the qualification of the men's team that returns to the Champions League after years of absence. We had prudently budgeted for sixth place for the Europa League. But we managed to do better, we are really happy ”.

**At the end of the first round you were winter champions, did you understand there that the goal could have been the Champions League?**

 “When we were winter champions I realized we could push our hearts a little further. We have lived through difficult moments but always full of confidence in our team, in our management and in our club that has given it all.

**On the victory at the Stadium:** 

“An important victory, but I don't want to give importance to the single match, the important thing is to continue to work in the same way. Pioli's Milan has shown that they know how to build a team in which you play a fun game, made up of young people in which everyone is useful but no one is truly indispensable. This seemed to me the real secret of the Pioli recipe, naturally built together with Paolo Maldini ”.

**Who are the front men?**

“The whole team put together. There have been many authors: Maldini, Pioli, Gazidis that we owe this young team to him. It is a team of people who all work for the same goal. This is more important in football than in any other profession ”.

**On the home-away performance:** 

“I don't have a rational explanation, I look at the overall figure: 13 points more than last year. That's what counts in the end, especially in an era of empty stadiums ”.

**On the losses due to Covid**: 

“Just today we had the advice of Milan and we looked at the result as at 31 March. The closed stadiums were a big blow but we had better results than last year. We managed to recover despite the severe blow suffered by the pandemic ”.

**How do you relate to agents and prosecutors?**

“I have little experience, I leave this task to Maldini and Massara. I've never met one ”.

**On Lega's advice:** 

“In my life I have participated in hundreds of councils and assemblies. The League council has very different teams within with different objectives and budgets, the League council is the terrain in which all these needs must find a composition in the common interest. It is not easy, they can seem always lively assemblies. However, the debate is necessary to reach a compromise. What some may call a quarrel I call the search for compromise ”.

**The Super League project:** 

“That project is buried, what is not dead is the fact that the big European clubs lose a lot of money, this cannot continue. It will be for Covid, it will be for too many excesses, it is certain that having the big European clubs at a loss remains a problem we have, we must face it all together looking at the revenues to offer the public more attractive shows. We have to intervene on costs, from this comes the survival of football. If the super league project is dead, the reasons why this project was conceived are still there ”.

**Regarding the cut of salaries:** 

“It is a terrain on which we can reflect on the reflections made at European level with UEFA and involve everyone. These are issues already dealt with in the United States and could become an element of discussion here too "".

**On the salary cap:**

“Somehow the FFP was built for the same reasons. Well-controlled and well-verified FFP could be a solution. The FFP has benefited the world of football, the first clubs in Europe have reduced their losses with this FFP ”.

**On Donnarumma:** 

“I don't think Milan want to give lessons to anyone. Milan tries to do their job and we are attentive to our income statement. I can't improve on Maldini's words from yesterday: his position is mine ”.

**On Maldini:** 

""We all have to learn and improve, Paolo is becoming more and more an international manager and he is doing it very well"".

**On the Stadium:**

“From what I read that Inter's problems are behind them. I am convinced that we need a new stadium, Milan needs it. We cannot go back to the top with the old Meazza. I think that the mayor and the municipal administration share this project, we absolutely have to accelerate. My great hope is always that the inauguration of the Olympics in 2026 can be made in the new stadium that we are going to build ”.

**Do we have to wait for the elections?**

 “I don't have the impression that the stadium is an election campaign theme. If Mayor Sala was against, he could have said it even earlier. As for the opposition, I don't see great opposition. Many realize that the Meazza is obsolete for our time and then I believe that all of us Milanese want to do a great project with a great investment that can relaunch our city that has spent more than an extremely difficult year "".

**The television broadcast will change next season, are the Italian structures up to par?**

 “This issue has certainly been brought to the attention of the League's bodies. It has been seen and reviewed in a thousand ways. We feel reassured by what has been guaranteed to us by technicians and experts "".

**On the audience in the stadiums:**

 “Going to the stadium and seeing Milan in an empty San Siro made me sad, I went by force. It was a very bad experience ""

**The dream for next season:**

 ""It is to be still in the Champions League, let's hope this happens"".

I am pleased to announce another AMA for this week! This time it is with Matteo Vismara, some of you may already know him if you follow the Radio Rossonera socials but for those who don't, Matteo dedicates a lot of his time in studying the fundamentals of the game and the characteristics that make young talents possible future stars.

I’ve learned from this situation. Maldini has shown us what it takes to be a man. Don’t let NOBODY step on your fuckin neck, no matter what they can bring to the table. 

Gigio actually thought Maldini was going to simp and beg. Weak men do that. Gigio ain’t shit. It’s about the club, the badge, the history, and the morals of the club. Maldini was not going to spend over half the budget on a goalkeeper. If it was Haaland or Mbappe, different story. 

Let’s not act like Maignan is a nobody. Dude just won Ligue 1 and is playing with France in the euros. He’s the future French #1 if he keeps it up and for 2m a year compared to 8m or 12m. 

Half the budget for next season was going to two people and one of them isn’t even a damn footballer. 

I’m happy. Champions are humble. I don’t believe #99 is humble anymore after years of his daddy whispering in his ear that he’s the best gk in the world since he was 19. It’s a shame Because we know how humans work, gigio will never recover from this. Greed will kill your inner thoughts when one realizes love does not exist with greed. 

Gigio will express his regrets once he becomes a man and is much wiser. He will always second guess this outcome until he enters the dirt.",ACMilan,Maldini is a role model,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nm1gnm/maldini_is_a_role_model/,2021-05-27 14:46:14

We see that majority of big clubs right now especially those outside England are struggling, the main reason seems to be debt. I guess DEBT is the biggest poison for a big club with ambition and I just love the Milan management for not undertaking any kind of debt. With debt a club needs to be paying an annual interest and thus the management needs to make sure that they make enough money from the club to pay the interest and also keep the club in top shape to continue making the money and paying the interest amount but the thing is football requires you to make correct decisions almost every year either in terms of player contracts or signing new players and if couple of decisions go the other way like a big money transfer didn’t work or a poor performing player on astronomical wages then the club suddenly starts suffering. Then if suddenly there is a situation like pandemic things get even worse, then we see big clubs trying to go for a super league to save themselves.

I just hope that Milan can further develop a good financial model else we will again end up in the vicious cycle from which we just came out.",ACMilan,Finances in football.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nm0r9w/finances_in_football/,2021-05-27 13:52:59

This is the perfect time to right the ship and hand the armband over to someone who is a true leader and also a capable team player. Someone who could actually motivate the team to do well and fight till the last second. 

Currently, I think the armband should go as follows: 

1) Ibrahimovic. The oldest, most decorated and our personality-changer. He demands respect from teammates and opponents alike.
2) Kessie. He will most likely be the captain for most games as Ibra is injury prone and in his last season. Just like Ibra, Kessie is a fighter and a leader and our most talented midfielder.
3) Kjaer. Professionalism, quality, and grinta. Lifted the quality of our defense instantly once he joined.

We're in quite the lucky position if you ask me. We've finished second, secured Champions League &amp; most importantly, aren't broke. Comparing to other Serie A clubs we're in for a stressless summer bar the Donnarumma soap that's been going on for way too long now. I for one, have been very happy with the way our board has handled this situation and is going to save a lot of money by going for a more than decent replacement in Mike Maignan. There are some players whose future are incertain (Calhanoglu, Romagnoli and some of the loaned players, but I feel that the club knows what they're doing. The transfers in the last 2-3 mercato's have made me trust our board more than any Milan board has in the last 5-10 years because I can clearly see the vision: don't spend too much, no insane contracts, agents don't hold the club hostage, trust the coach, find young talents (Theo, Hauge, Saelemakers, Kalulu, Tomori, Tonali, Bennacer, Diaz, Leao,...) and surround them with experienced players (Zlatan, Kjaer, Mandzukic)

This all is in contrast to all the other top teams in Serie A who don't have either the results we have or aren't as continuous going into the next season;

Juve has the Champions League-ban hanging over them, they don't know who's going to be the coach next season and they might lose out on Ronaldo, Dybala &amp; De Ligt.  
Inter did win the Scudetto BUT they're about to lose their 2 most valuable assets due to the ownership: Lukaku &amp; Conte.

Take it with a grain of salt...if true, though, the club really taking no prisoners.  

&amp;#x200B;

 

Milan are not going to offer Alessio Romagnoli a new contract, claim reports, so the captain will be put on the market.

The centre-back’s current deal is due to expire in June 2022, so he must be sold this summer or risk leaving as a free agent.

According to Calciomercato.com, the 26-year-old was not even proposed a contract extension and instead invited to leave the club.

He was snapped up for €25m from Roma in 2015 and also played for Sampdoria during a loan spell in 2014-15.

Romagnoli had increasingly been pushed to the touchline at San Siro, first due to injury, then with the arrival of Fikayo Tomori from Chelsea.

He managed 30 competitive appearances this season, including one goal and one assist.

Romagnoli has been linked with a move to Juventus and, like Gianluigi Donnarumma, is another client of agent Mino Raiola.

The defender also has 12 senior caps for Italy with two goals.",ACMilan,MILAN INVITE ROMAGNOLI TO LEAVE,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nli3l8/milan_invite_romagnoli_to_leave/,2021-05-26 22:16:44

Intrepid_Potential_3,1621927370.0,nkjsru,34.0,1.0,"It seems we are all over the place with the thought of Gigio leaving and Mike coming in with fans ranging from fuck gigio and his greed to great decision by the management. Let me try to nudge the discussion towards possible realistic impact this will have on the team.

FINANCES:

I guess any fan with a basic grip on mathematics would know that atleast we are gonna save money,
Lets see how much.

As per reports Gigio has refused a 8 mil/yr contract and demands a 10 mil/year contract along with agent fee which is somewhere in the range of 20 mil. Based on this it would cost the club 70 mil in next 5 years. Which is like having a 12 mil per year Goalkeeper in the squad, probably highest in the world for a team which has missed out 7 years of UCL money.
Going with Mike for 3 mil/year will cost Milan 15 mil and if there is an agent fee it would be at max 5 mil so total cost of Mike is 20 mil and this saves Milan 50 mil in the next 5 years.
So with this 50 mil lets see what kind of impact it will have.

SPORTING:

Assuming Milan are going to reinvest the 50 mil the best possible method will be to recruit 2 high quality players with a 6+4 mil a year contract and I guess we can get those now that we have CL. And I assume these signings as an addition to those we are going to make anyways.

CONS:

Well its not all good and a win win situation. Gigio was a key character and has been in the club for a lot of time, as fans we always wanted him to be our symbol like how Paolo was and if he joins a rival club then he adds to their quality which would directly affect us in a competitive manner but regardless lets not curse him for making a professional decision, for the time he played for us he has generously contributed to the team, he deserved each penny he got and even if it makes us sad to see him leave us lets not be a dick about it.

CONCLUSION:
10 mil per year with 20 mil agent fees is definitely not a good deal for the club. It would hamper our growth a great deal and we could end up being less competitive as a club which aspires to stay in UCL during this pandemic.",ACMilan,Balancing the financial and sporting decision for Gigio and Mike,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nkjsru/balancing_the_financial_and_sporting_decision_for/,2021-05-25 15:22:50

&amp;#x200B;

After an exciting evening, for those who love the Rossoneri colours, with extraordinary happiness we conclude an exciting season by entering the Champions League, with all our Teams.

&amp;#x200B;

In a difficult historical moment for everyone in the world, including all Milanese and Milanisti, we are really proud to have reached this important goal for the Club all together.

&amp;#x200B;

We are still at the beginning of an ambitious path: to bring Milan back to where it deserves to be, at the top of world football, creating an innovative model, on and off the field, with a solid and sustainable future, through strong values in which to identify itself.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite the difficulties due also to the effect of the Pandemic, our reality is more and more concrete. We are a Club that has aroused great emotions, that has demonstrated its value on the field, expressing an avant-garde playing identity, with a unique model on the field, with young talents and considerable growth potential. We are a Club that is striving to achieve financial sustainability and that has confirmed itself as a brand that is recognized and admired internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the foundations that we have built and that we will further strengthen, starting tomorrow, with renewed energy and ambition, together with the Technical Area, the entire management and the staff of the Club. We have taken the right path and we must continue our journey together, with the support of our wonderful fans and our prestigious partners.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that these are still difficult times and I want to thank all of you for what you do and show every day for the Club.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's continue like this: together, we are the strength of this Club, we are the spirit and energy of Milan.

&amp;#x200B;

Forza Milan, always!

sawyer78,1621813991.0,njkmwt,11.0,1.0,"Just some words about the last couple of seasons:

The start of the 2019/2020 season was such a shitshow. Giampaolo was a disaster, all of our new signings were either not performing or not getting played at all, and the team had no identity to speak of. It was one of the worst starts to a season I’ve ever seen.

Pioli comes on board after we finally sack Giampaolo, #pioliout starts trending before the ink is even dry on his contract, and nobody expects him to amount to much at all. And at first, he doesn’t do much better, capping off the first half of the season with a crushing 5-0 loss to a little team from down the road called Atalanta.

It looked like we were doomed to forever be stuck in the misery of our never-ending banter era, but something changed once the calendar flipped to 2020. The lion, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, himself was brought back to the club. The man whose departure, along with Thiago Silva, was the harbinger of our downfall, was being brought back at this lowest point to somehow help turn the tide. I know I can’t be the only one who never expected the type of impact he would have.

We also can’t forget the other new addition, Kjær, and what a difference these two veterans made on the rest team - finally we had the leaders and experience that our young team needed to make the jump to the next level.

With all of the chaos and tragedy that defined the year 2020 throughout the world, the Rossoneri remained as one of the lone bright spots in a dark year for their fans. After the arrival of Zlatan, they would go on to only lose two Serie A games for the entire calendar year, breaking too many records to list here along the way. It was an unbelievable turnaround, with nearly every player on the team performing far better than they had previously, and despite the awful start of the 2019-2020 season, they managed to claw their way back to a 6th place finish.

The great run of form continued into the new season after the very short summer break. A potentially disastrous start to being back in Europe was narrowly avoided after overtime and 24 penalties in one of the most epic games of the year in the rain against Rio Ave. Things went smoother in Serie A, with Milan winning their first 4 games, including the first derby against Inter. Milan would finish out the calendar year undefeated in Serie A and winter champions.

However, all good things must come to an end as the Rossoneri stumbled in the first game of 2021. Injuries and exhaustion from the jam packed schedule of the last few months had begun to take their toll, with large parts of the starting 11 missing at one of the most crucial moments in the season. 

Milan were knocked out of the Coppa Italia and the Europa League, and were dislodged from 1st place in Serie A for the first time all season. Unfortunately their amazing run had been divided across two separate seasons, and now it was beginning to look like everything they had worked for over the past two years would be thrown away at the last minute. 

The outcome looked especially dire after the back to back disappointments against Sassuolo and Lazio, but somehow, possibly thanks to the return of a certain Swedish striker from injury, they managed to turn their form back around and crush the defending champions Juve 3-0, ensuring a potentially crucial head to head advantage. They followed that up with the biggest win in decades, 7-0 against Torino. This rollercoaster of a season wasn’t over yet however, as they failed to secure that oh-so-important Champion’s League spot after the incredibly disappointing draw against Cagliari in the penultimate game of the season. 

On the final day, against the one team Pioli had been unable to beat in this incredible run, the team that had handed them the humiliating 5-0 defeat that signified the club hitting rock bottom, Milan would have to face Atalanta in Bergamo with absolutely everything on the line. 

I’m still in a state of disbelief of the result - I can’t believe it, after all these years of heartbreak and disappointment - we’re finally back.


This went on way longer than I had planned, and I didn’t even get to so much that made this season so special, but I really can’t thank Milan and this community enough for helping everyone here get through the last year.

Samkazi23,1621812157.0,njk1wz,18.0,1.0,"Paolo Maldini and Milan got the success they were hoping for this evening as a brace from Franck Kessie was enough to beat Atalanta. And with that, they secured their return to the Champions League after seven long years. 

The Rossoneri, in addition to the UCL return, finished the season on a high and snatched second place from Atalanta. It’s a drop that means €5m less in prize money for the Bergamo side, so they did have incentives to win this clash.

In an interview with Sky Italia after the game, as cited by MilanNews, sporting director Paolo Maldini spoke about tonight’s success and what it means for the club. He also made it clear that the team really deserved this.

In light of this milestone, it’s nice to look back and say that the choices were good…

“I believe that no one can deny the fact that it’s a well-deserved success, we did it believing and suffering. We are the youngest team in Italy. We were asked to lower the wage bill, we needed to be creative. The club was supportive, the coaches and the players did a fantastic job. The mentality of having no excuses created something out of the ordinary, it was our secret.”

On the difficult moments…

“I cannot deny that the difficult moments have been there, we have no regrets about what happened, things could have been done even better. We were rewarded for the choices made, not only the players but also for behaviour and communication.”

The attitude of the group…

“I was lucky enough to have started with Leonardo from whom I learned a lot. There is always something to learn. Since this a very young team, your talks with individuals are much more frequent than those our managers did with us.

“Involving everyone is the biggest challenge, many feel they are passing through, others are on loan, the condition of COVID hasn’t helped us. It was a daily job, you divide yourself between the field and the desk.”

The closeness to Pioli…

“The truth is that Pioli has never been questioned. We must always remember where we started from, after the 5-0 defeat we suffered right. We were honest in saying things, we didn’t talk much but we always told the truth.”

On Donnarumma…

“There will be time. Tonight I can’t tell you anything, it’s not even fair to say something tonight. It’s not the time to talk but to celebrate, he was one of the happier. It’s a goal that has also passed through his saves.”

For how long have you not heard the anthem?

“I haven’t been in the Champions League for a while, Milan for seven years. We are happy, we have had a fantastic path but Milan must be in the Champions League permanently also to compete economically with other clubs.”

Have you always believed in it?

“We believed in it even when things weren’t going well. We saw different things, we saw that the players had the potential to do more. Some want everything immediately, but with the 20-year-olds wearing a prestigious shirt it’s not like this. These are guys who can do even better, at 20-21 years old you are not as strong as you are at 25.”

The summer transfer window will surely be a whole lot more interesting now as UCL guarantees an extra €60m into Milan’s coffers, roughly. It’s a boost that came come into good use for the planned signings.

Samkazi23,1621807714.0,njilsm,10.0,1.0,"AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli thanked the management, his players and his wife in reflecting on sealing a Champions League return.

Milan ensured that they will be playing Champions League football for the first time since the 2013-14 season with a colossal 2-0 win over Atalanta.

Milan went into the game knowing that only three points would guarantee a top four spot, with Juventus and Napoli facing favourable games against Bologna and Hellas Verona respectively.

In the end it would be a Franck Kessie penalty in the first half that would set the Rossoneri on their way, and they got a second spot kick in added time at the end of the second half that the Ivorian also tucked away.

The result also means that Milan leapfrog their Lombardy neighbours into second place for their highest finish since 2012.

Pioli was interviewed by Sky Italia at the end of the game, with his comments transcribed by MilanNews and translated below.

Mission accomplished, how did you achieve it? “We achieved it because we deserved it and we deserved second place in the standings. It was right, unfortunately we had thrown away last Sunday’s match point. I am really excited and happy. I have to thank the club for making us work spectacularly. Thanks to the managers, the technical area, the players, the collaborators and the fans who once again showed us today how much Milan is worth. We are satisfied to have them happy.”

Kessie the decisive man? “Never as tonight I believe it is right to enhance the collective beyond the individuals. When you have these satisfactions in a season it is also thanks to the players who have played less… Gabbia, Krunic, Dalot, Kalulu. Kessie is in the spotlight and deserves only the compliments for the season she has done.

“It is all we have done together, the strength not to break down in difficulties. I am very proud of the mental growth of the group. We played with Zlatan only 19 out of 38 games, taking away the champion from the other teams for half the season I would like to see what they would do. I thank the club, now there is satisfaction and we must enjoy it. I also thought that if we were fifth it would be a difficult summer. Now we enjoy it and then we will leave again.”

Have you ever wondered why you were better away from home?

“We asked ourselves, we tried to evaluate this situation well. We weren’t a team that made a lot of 1vs1s in the last quarter of the pitch. We miss the individual play when the teams close, in this data we are below average. We lacked some individual play. On the road, perhaps we found some more space, this is a situation that we will have to evaluate.

“I heard that this team took advantage of the absence of fans in the stadiums at least initially to find serenity, but I’m sure this team here with the enthusiasm of our fans at San Siro would have grown a lot. What the fans did for us this morning and the other times has filled us with warmth and passion, we have shown that we believe in it together with them. To conclude I want to wish my wife on our wedding anniversary, they are 34 years together. Grant it to me (laughs).”",ACMilan,"Pioli: ""I am very proud of the mental growth of the group.

In case anyone wanted to watch the game tonight in Madrid, this is the official club in the city. The bar is called 'El Miau de Fucar', nearby Atocha.

Ahead of the game, AC Milan's 38th and final challenge of the Serie A season, Coach Pioli has, as usual, spoken to the press to analyse the key challenges that his team face. His words were broadcast live on the AC Milan Official App.**

THIS WEEK AT THE CLUB
""It's certainly been a strange week. There was a lot of disappointment until Wednesday when we upped the concentration levels and motivation - there were also a few nerves, which is normal. We tried to have the best week possible and I have seen the right attitude. During the week, I also went back over the preparations that my Lazio side, which qualified for the Champions League, did ahead of the final game of the season against Napoli.""

REASONS TO BELIEVE
""AC Milan need to believe because we've shown all year that we're a strong side and one that's close to the best teams in the division. We need to believe because we've shown all the quality, spirit, attitude and desire to be a good team. We've played every four or five days since 17 September and have never given up; we've always given everything. What do we need tomorrow evening? Mental fortitude, compactness and quality."" 

THE GROUP
""Rebić is a doubt; we'll see tomorrow morning. He's had a problem with his calf and couldn't complete a full training session this morning. The others are well and in great condition. We're all going tomorrow, all 26 players, the team and the Club. The fans will be with us too; we have the conditions to do well. Zlatan will also obviously travel with us, but won't be on the bench. His importance in the growth of this team is clear; we'll need to be mentally strong, determined and fluid.""


TOGETHER WITHOUT FEAR
""There have been a lot of conversations and discussions this week - both individual and on a collective level. Motivation is running high. Everything we've done has been to get to tomorrow with the best chance possible to obtain a positive result. The team has never shown fear. Fear is like fire; if you manage it well then it can heat you, otherwise, it burns. The lads have always displayed a brilliant mental attitude. We've never given up, we've never looked beaten. This week, I saw all the things that I wanted to see ahead of tomorrow's game. We cannot think about what might've been, about what we wanted and didn't reach. We have done all we can to recoup our energy throughout this week.""

INJURIES
""They've certainly had an impact, especially because we had two blocks of injuries with almost everyone out in a single department, which affected us in the various competitions. For the games that we've played, we're slightly above average, but we had periods with 6-7 players out and this affected us. From Monday, we'll need to take a look at what we can do better in the coming seasons.""

ONLY TOMORROW COUNTS
""We'll only take stock at the end - the journalists will give the ratings. For what we've done, we're deservedly third going into tomorrow but any evaluation has to be done after tomorrow evening. Tomorrow's result is the only thing that matters, then we'll be in a better position to take stock of the various emotions. We're convinced that we'll get chances. We need to just be aware of the difficulties that will crop up during the game, but when you're confident, you can overcome them and get a good result.""

Aniket_1992,1621405120.0,nfxz7l,25.0,1.0,"I am assuming that we want to play an attacking brand of football. Playing attacking/offensive football benefits not only in winning points per matches but also looks good in the eye attracting more interests and there by converting into more revenues. All good teams we know were all known for their attacks, like Man city with KDB/Sterling/Aguero, Liverpool with Mane/Salah, the famous MSN and BBC of Barca and Real. Now I am not downplaying the defensive part, defence needs to be solid as well but it shouldn’t be all that we should depend upon. I don’t agree to the phrase completely that defence wins you league. Only when coupled with a good offensive play style does the importance pf defending comes into play. It should always be score first and then defend not defend first and then hope to score. 

I hope Milan is trying to achieve a good offensive playing philosophy but then given the financial constraints we have should we be paying 8 mil to a GK? Sure he has been fantastic for us and some of you might say that he has literally won us points by his own but my point is reinvesting that amount on some top class striker or winger would have also won us matches where we barely got a shot on goal thus giving us even more points. There is a reason why Gk are not paid a lot as an average top team player as they can be replaced and their impact for an offensive side is not that much.

Most of us here will be upset on gigio leaving but it would be mainly because we saw him as our future symbol like Maldini or him leaving is not a big issue but him leaving for free is.

romarioestrada7,1621295066.0,nevhkt,5.0,1.0,"Hello Milan Family, 

It is now Monday and I finally have the courage to put my feelings into words. After the match vs Cagliari, much like you, I was left speechless, disapointed, and heartbroken. 

For the better part of the last decade Milan had been a mediocre club at worst and a midtable team at best. Somewhere along the path of these past seasons we begain to settle for less and less achievments. We traded trophies for draws, and time stood still for us and the rest of the world of football left us behind. As AC Milan fans, we witnessed other clubs make the best signings. We became numb and somehow settled for less, we accepted our dysfunctional beloved club and all of its flaws. We never gave up hope. With the pain and sorrow of the previous season, we looked forward to starting a new campaign hoping for less pain and some magical moments. As the seasons came and went, we endured more and more pain, and witnessed the magic leave Milanello and go to other clubs. During these past 10 years of utter struggle, much like all of you, I stood beside Milan with my hand on my heart and my mind looking towards a brighter future. The love for this club is undescribable, I can not put into words how much I love AC Milan. But for some time now I feel more sadness than joy. After loosing all hope, along come this young and talented squad a couple years ago. I was reborn, and after Sunday, this squad killed me. All true milan fans know what will happen if we do not qualify to Champions League, players will leave for free, and we will not make top signings. All this, putting us even further away from Champions League qualification next season. I do not believe we will win at Atalanta this weekend. Our situation is the physical embodiment of what it means to be so close yet so far from something. My love for Milan runs so deep that I cannot take the disapointment and stress anymore. I cannot watch another Champions League with clubs like Sevilla, Juventus, Inter, Dortmund, etc. Clubs that have no magic, yet deserve to be there 100 more times than us. Milan is football history, Milan is Champions League history. I love this club so much, yet they always hurt me at the end of every season. The future now looks dark. After 0-0 this weekend, Champions League is miles away, and with that Gigio and Hakan. Theo, Bennacer, and Kessie will be lured away by top clubs. 100 million euros in revenue will not come. No Tomori, and no top Striker. For what its worth I enjoyed most of this season so much and will be grateful for this Serie A Campaign. Milan and I need a break, all relationships do. If we lose against Atalanta, the pain of all these year will come rushing back to me, I cry as I write this now. I have witnessed so many defeats, and to be out of the champions league by 1 point again will be devastating. I love you all. I love Milan, but the pain is too deep. I just need a break from this abusive relationship. Forza MILAN. We will be back one day.",ACMilan,Heart Break,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nevhkt/heart_break/,2021-05-18 07:44:26

My head hurts just by remenbering these names and squads. 
Idk you people but I dont wanna do another leap of faith to return to the banter era, break the locker room and tarnish all the good work the team made so far. We aren't champions league level yet. But this season was a damn good stepping stone in my opinion. This is progress.

Since 38 match seasons were introduced, 75 points has always been good enough for top 4, if not top 2 - we achieved this despite our top goal scorer being an often injured 39 yr old striker, our wingers being weak, and with a fairly poor bench.  It hurts to be so close to achieving our goals while leaving fate up to the final match day, but given the makeup of our squad, we have a lot to be proud of.  The league is stronger, more competitive, and we’ve got one more chance to keep Juve out after a decade of domination.  We’ve come this far, don’t lose hope!

Things are looking grim there is no denying any of that, but we have to look at the positives, beacuse they are out there, lots of them. You dont beat Juve by luck 3 : 0 then forgot to play football against Cagliari. Boys are afraid, they choked. Life happens, but we have 1 match left, we have to forget other results (Juve and Napoli droping points) like they dont exist. This is our final and I know they have it in them to win it. That being 1 : 0 shithousery win in last minutes or another Ala Juve game 3:0 and etc.

I couldn’t tell you why yesterday was the one that hurt most, or even why after all these years I find myself actually feeling a weight on my shoulders.

I mean, it’s only football? 

But it has been quite something “football stories” reverberating through history, stories which have changed fortunes and even shaped the future of clubs. Going to Atalanta is, I believe, always written.

How fitting that many of our most horrible defeats have been at the hands of the Bergamo team. A lot of our most recent capitulations have been at their hands too.

But just imagine. Just believe for one second that we do it. We win. The whole story wraps up, the book closes, and we look back over the course of 18 months and think - that’s it. We did it. 

We will win this game. I know we will. I’ll see you all next Sunday where we go again.

Samkazi23,1621103808.0,nd5g2z,2.0,1.0,"On the eve of the showdown, Coach Pioli held a press conference from Milanello, with his words being broadcast live on the AC Milan Official App. The Coach started off by sending his personal praise to the AC Milan Women’s team and Coach, Maurizio Ganz, for their historic qualification for the Women’s Champions League.

* PREPARATIONS 

""In these present moments, it’s important that we stay focused and motivated. Tomorrow’s game could cap off an exceptional season, regarding both performances and results. We’ve always played well, with a good balance in the side, and we will need to carry that forward into tomorrow’s game.""

* CAGLIARI

""It’ll be a tough game, as they will be dogged and determined on the pitch. They have some quality players and will be motivated, as we are. We have to aim to be better than our opponents, to create more opportunities than them and give away less. My group of guys are very aware of the challenge, and always understand how to approach games in the right way. They work in a focused manner, always aiming to help each other out and play as a unit. We’ll have to stay compact and put in a top-notch performance.”

* NEARLY THERE

""The history of the club tells you that Europe is AC Milan’s home. It’s normal that our expectations are so high, as we are a big club, with a fantastic fanbase behind us. We know how hard we have worked all season, so we just need to be brave and mentally ready. No games are easy in Serie A, so we are prepared to fight tomorrow against a side full of dangerous players. We’ll only be satisfied if and when we achieve our objective.""


* IBRA

""Ibra is undergoing a careful rehabilitation process, which will allow him to come back 100% fit next season. Today, I saw him after his session with the physios, and he was calm. Tomorrow he will be with us, supporting the team as ever, and we’ll be sad not to have him on the pitch.""

* THE IMPORTANCE OF EVERYONE

""Everyone is raising their level, these final two games will decide our fate. On Wednesday evening, Leão, Meïte and Krunić all played decisive roles after coming on. The best possible team will start tomorrow, but substitutions will be crucial because it’ll be our third match in eight days. Dalot? He’s a fantastic professional, truly exceptional. It’s easy to give credit to those who have played more often, but those who have spent less time on the pitch have played a vital role, also in terms of raising the quality of our daily work.""

* VALUES

""From my first day at Milanello, I’ve always felt that I was in the right place. Here, there’s great support and respect. It’s also a place where there’s a real sense of belonging and professionalism, with work being done by everyone for the good of the Club: these are values that I also share. All of this has always given us the strength to continue to believe in the work we’re doing. We still haven’t achieved our objective, evaluations are always made at the end.""

* FOCUSING ON TOMORROW

""Despite the defeats to Sassuolo and Lazio, we were aware that we were on the right track. Belief in our work allowed us to not get too downhearted at such a difficult moment, and we never stopped believing in our qualities. When you start from such a solid foundation, it makes dealing with challenging moments easy. Tomorrow, we must only rely on ourselves, the other results will be what they’ll be. We need to play our game and focus on ourselves.""",ACMilan,"Pioli: ""Despite the defeats to Sassuolo and Lazio, we were aware that we were on the right track...

Dishanta_Patowary,1621088109.0,ncztt0,14.0,1.0,"Hey everyone! 
So there's something curious I noticed and wanted to share with you guys. 

Rebic previously played in the Bundesliga where they put a lot of emphasis on fans (eg: the 50+1 rule which ensures fans are connected to the clubs and have some sort of a say). 
I remembered my friend telling me that Bayern has retired the number 12 shirt in honor of the fans (""the fans are the 12th player"" he said). A quick Google search told me a few other clubs did the same and in general majority of the Bundesliga clubs refrained form using the number 12 for the same reason. 

So, when Rebic decided to switch from 18 to 12 (which is not a very popularly used number) did he do it as a tribute to the fans? 

I just connected the dots, didn't get this anywhere. I don't even know if I'm making any sense here. 
But if this is actually true then mad respect to him, and his image has grow even more in my view.

Then have a pretty glaring need for more talent on the right....... why is it that some of that “left flank talent” can’t play right, so we can have two strong sides !!??

I understand that every player has their stronger side, but damn! I played my entire life, and while right flank was a preference, there was never a hesitation when asked to play on the left. It would even give me a chance to cut in and shoot with my preferred right foot.

Sandro Tonali 15 mil € + agent fee.
Donnaruma agent wants 20 mil € fee. 
+Calhanoglu agent fee if he agrees on a new deal.

That already is 62.5 mil € + Calhanoglu, Tonali and Tomori agent fees.

If we won't be able to renew loans of Diaz and Dalot we will also have to find solutions to their positions, which will cost us more money.

Also there is obvious need to replace Samu, which i doubt we will have money for.

* After this victory, Milan are three points from the Champions League and have fate in their own hands.

“It’s true. Having this possibility before the two away matches in Turin was very ambitious. Being able to win them was not easy, it was very complicated. Even this evening, despite the result saying something else. We have two games ahead and we must continue to play with this attention, with this spirit, with this quality and this desire to hurt our opponents and think about the next one.”

* Are you satisfied with the 10 goals scored and 0 conceded in the last two games?

“The numbers speak for themselves and respect attitude and performance. We have been more compact on a defensive level, we have given a few points of reference to our opponents and we have created a lot.”

* What was the secret of this period?

“Our secrets are the balance that comes to us from the club, which has made us work at our best in this very special year and a half. The balance of not being too attracted to the positive and negative results and then the work. We have always tried to improve. We had a lot of ups, a few lows but that’s normal in a season like this, where we started playing very early. Europe took something away from us but, with a little more luck, we could have gone all the way. The balance and protection of the club, which is fantastic, together with the team’s desire to grow and improve.”


* What will you have to work on in view of Cagliari?

“Certainly on the psychological aspect, because the pressures are rising but we come from two games where the pressure was very high. It was easy to think that if it went badly with Juventus, our chances of reaching the goal would decrease. That was the key game and between Sunday and today we showed great maturity and it made us understand how to face the next one. We have to prepare it in the best possible way and everyone who goes on the pitch will have to know that each of his teammates will give 110% because we are these.”

* The team plays with great quality and fun

“We like to play football, which has excellent technique and is right to play. It is normal to take risks, even tonight we did it, but we have the pleasure of playing with the ball between our feet, trying to be dangerous and we think it is the correct way to continue in our work and I think it is also the right way to the colours we wear, because Milan have always played good football and must continue to do so.”


* Could Ibrahimovic recover in time for Atalanta?

“On Sunday I don’t think there are any possibilities, for the last game we hope.”",ACMilan,"Pioli: ""It was easy to think that if it went badly with Juventus, our chances of reaching the goal would decrease.

I have been very critical of Pioli for the longest time and it's only fair to take my hat off for that performance and state one more time that I enjoy being proven wrong because it's for the best of the team. That's what we all want. Massive support for the last 3 games of the season no matter what happens ! The way he celebrated the goals yelling and hugging with the players was wholesome to say the least 🙂 ❤️ 🖤 nothing but respect to that man, i think he has tremendous class and he's such a humble and educated guy. Doesn't mean I won't criticize as a fan when I disagree with his stubbornness sometimes but anyways. Cheers everyone!

The Rossoneri return to action at 20:45 CEST tomorrow, Wednesday 12 May, for the midweek fixture valid for matchday 36 of Serie A: Davide Nicola is the Coach in charge of Torino, who is going through a very positive spell at the moment. On the eve of the match, Coach Pioli held a press conference.**

* KICKING ON FROM SUNDAY'S WIN

""One of our greatest qualities is balance and how we have bounced back from big defeats, like Lazio. Now, we're just concentrating on tomorrow's game, which is an important one. Given that we're facing a sightly different opposition and because we need points to reach our objective.""

* ZLATAN'S INJURY AND CHOICES UP TOP

""The only sour note from a near-perfect night. He's got a slight knee problem and will not be available for tomorrow or for Sunday. We'll keep tabs on his development over the next week. Brahim has the characteristics to determine games and he's the best we have at playing between the lines alongside Hakan, but it'll be a totally different game to the one we saw on Sunday. Our aim is to bring our own characteristics to bear and to fully profit from them. But we will also look to match up with their positions, as they can gift you chances. A mature team makes the right choices at the right time.""

* DONNARUMMA'S SITUATION

""Gigio is a professional and is very invested in AC Milan and us right now. Like the rest of the players, he's focused on the Torino game and on the end of the season. Nobody will think or talk about his future until 24 May. We just need to concentrate on our game tomorrow.""

* REBIĆ'S SITUATION

""Ante is invested in his work and the work that we're doing. He's a starter at AC Milan and he knows it. He reacted well on Sunday. I prepare for games on the basis of what I think could benefit us the most and what I think is right for the team. Everyone that isn't picked to start should be angry - they all want to play. I've always told the players that it's not a problem if, one day, they stop chatting to me and turn their backs; the important thing is that we never lack the spirit of sacrifice and a hunger to help the team.2  


* THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUALS

""You play, you win and you lose as a team. Individual performances lift the side, though there's a collective that has worked hard in the same direction all season.""

* CHOICES FOR TORINO

""I picked the team for Juve based on the defensive phase, which I didn't like against Benevento. We tried to play with a more compact team and when you are that compact, you are more organised and more aggressive, and the defenders need to work less. The team looks to have recovered well; between today and tomorrow, I will have a think about team selections."" 

* POSSIBLE ELATION

""I'm always more concerned with the game but I don't fear elation. I don't know how Torino will approach the game; on our side, we need to dictate the game in order to kick on from Sunday's performance. We're in the decisive part of the season and we'll need to play with that same spirit. Winning on Sunday gave us a great feeling; we beat a strong team and this has given us confidence but we are conscious of the fact that it's not over yet. We have three games left and we need to keep this attitude up. Each game has its difficulties; being a team means knowing how to overcome them as a unit.""

* PERSONAL GROWTH

""I try to improve each day because I have a lot of passion. My past experiences have helped me but I still have a lot of hunger to improve. The atmosphere at Milanello is great which helps in my work.""      ",ACMilan,"Can Dalot instead of Castillejo be in place of the suspended Saelemaekers on the right?

I will not be interpreting the stats this time around, but I am open to discussion. My opinion is that Belotti is our best-case scenario **BY A MILE**, considering cost-efficiency. I am intrigued by how much he can improve in a big team if his mental game ticks. Vlahovic on the other hand seems to be a great zone striker, understands very well the goal. But, he has to grow a lot when it comes to contribution play, the signs are there for him to become a great striker but he has a lot of work to do. I think it is too early for him to make the leap.

HommoFroggy,1620730286.0,n9u87h,0.0,1.0,"Earlier today it was posted a discussion thread about Vlahovic and Belotti, on who is better and who would fit us better for next season. So I made a simple stats table divided into different categories to give more context to the discussion. In the stats table, you will find the two comparable with Lukaku, Immobile, and Morata as well, to give more context and meaning to the table... because you can compare players' playstyles with your eye test. I will not interpret the data as I do in other posts I make of this sort, but I am very open and intrigued by this discussion.

My very simple and straightforward opinion is that Belotti is the best cost-efficient option by **A MILE.** Vlahovic seems to understand very well the penalty box and how to attack the zone but he has to develop a lot when it comes to participating actively to play, while he shows great early potential.

Does he have some flaws like not good work ethic and sometimes poor decisions? Yes sure.

But this notion that he's like Niang who was allergic to goal scoring etc. Or as toxic like Balotelli is absolutely laughable.

He has as many goals and assists as Rebic who people love to praise and who until this spring was relatively anonymous in this season. Rebic works way harder than Leao, but he also misses some big chances (like Leao) and he's nowhere as technically as good as Leao.

Rebic works hard but often times he would have very anonymous games because he's not really a technician like Leao.

However, if people wants to compare the two. Just remember Leao is 21 years old, whereas, Rebic is 27.

To me a perfect player would combine Rebics work ethic and finishing with Leaos technique and talent.

Furthermore, this notion that he's like Balotelli is just straight up retarded. Balotelli was an upright lockeroom cancer to his team and just straight up toxic and takes a lot of space. I haven't heard negative anything of Leao off the pitch.


I am going to go as far to say, Leao get those comparisons because he's black like Balotelli or Niang. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to me.

""We always try to prepare a strategy for the game, then we choose the players suitable for the characteristics. Calhanoglu and Diaz are better at working on the frontline. Tonight's win can't be due to a single aspect, it was a team victory. We deservedly won. We are delighted for our fans who excited us this morning, now we have to think about the next one.""

""We played a great match, a direct match at this moment in the championship is very important. Unfortunately it is not the last game, we still have to fight. In this year and a half in Milan, the club made us work in the best conditions. possible, we share everything, joys and even some disappointments we have suffered"".

We knew we had to bring such a performance, when there was the moment of contrasts and duels we did not hold back.""

**On the defensive phase:** 

""Juve are changing lately as so many teams are doing. I was not convinced they would have built with three at the back, but we were prepared to be compact. When you have pressure on the ball carriers, you can give yourself a few one on ones. We risked very little defensively except on Bentancur's attempt at the beginning of the second half. I saw the semi-finals of the Champions League and I was impressed by how the City and Chelsea players worked without the ball. If we combine quantity and quality we can become a team that can have its say in this Champions fight.""

**The Brahim Diaz move, did you get inspiration from Guardiola?** 

""No, he's been playing without strikers lately. We had him, even though Zlatan is an attacking playmaker. We were good at emptying and filling the spaces. I coach a very young team that is becoming mature. We were team after the wrong penalty.""

A very important match between two teams fighting for a place in the top four. The Rossoneri take on Juventus at the Allianz Stadium, in an attempt to 'avenge' the defeat from the first round at San Siro, and to try to take get closer to qualifying for next season’s Champions League. It will be a difficult and delicate match against a great team. On the eve of the match, Coach Pioli spoke about the game at his press conference, with his words being broadcast live on the AC Milan Official App.

TOMORROW’S MATCH
""Tomorrow evening, we’ll need to try to benefit from everything we’ve done on our journey so far. In doing so, we can prove that we’ve become a mature team. We’ll have to be attentive and pick the right moments as we look to interpret the match successfully, this will be very important. Is this the most exciting, fascinating and perhaps important match? I think so, but dreams are only beautiful if they come true. It’ll be an exciting match, we think we’ve prepared for it in the best way possible.""

A SINGLE OBJECTIVE
""At this current time, all the players and everyone at Milanello have a single objective: working for the good of AC Milan. I have no doubts about the professionalism of the players: this isn’t a lazy group but one which is made up of players who have sweated for this shirt and will continue to do so right until the end, irrespective of what the future holds. We’re focused on tomorrow and on giving our all. We’ve spoken about tomorrow’s match and what is required on the pitch, all of us are only concentrating on giving our best against Juventus. Both the mental and physical sides of things are vital. Our motivation levels are at a maximum, and we certainly have the energy to finish the season well. Anything can be achieved if you believe.""

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MATCH
""Whoever wins will have a great chance to qualify for the Champions League, but it won’t be over following tomorrow night: nine points to play for are a lot. The fact that we have two matches against direct rivals – Juve and Atalanta – means that we’re in charge of our own destiny. However, it’s useless to talk about our upcoming matches: there’s only one game on our minds right now, which is tomorrow’s showdown. This is a six-pointer between two teams that possess quality and important characteristics. In order to pick up an extraordinary result, we need to put in a lot of effort and stay in contention without giving up for 95 minutes.""


IBRA AND THE GROUP
""It’s clear just how important Zlatan is for our team. However, he can’t be the only one who can win it for us: we need to show that we’re mature enough to understand the situations that can make the difference. We’re the team that have had the most shots from outside the box but have scored the least, we need to be more compact and show all our qualities out on the pitch. Ibra is part of this.""


TACTICS
""As opposed to playing with many attackers, I think it’s important to attack with many players: you need to try to trouble opposition defences. Zlatan won’t be left alone up front. We know we’ll be up against a high-quality team with strong players, but we believe in our abilities. We’ll have to limit their qualities when they’re in possession, and we’ll need to do well when we’re on the ball. If you want to play effective and fast football, movements need to be made at the right times. We did well against Benevento: we moved the ball quickly and gave them few points of reference. This needs to be our objective tomorrow: we’ll be aiming to be unpredictable. If we continually move against a strong defence with experience and physicality like Juve's, we have higher hopes of causing them problems.""

TURNING POINT
""Tomorrow will be decisive in terms of demonstrating our progress thanks to our work and showing that we’ve reached high levels. In terms of confidence and the chance to pick up a positive result, we’re fully aware of what we can do. I’ve seen a team that is mentally ready and aware of its capabilities. There’s pressure on both teams, but we wanted to feel pressure like this by raising our expectations. Tomorrow can be a turning point, also with our future in mind.""

[https://www.football-italia.net/170245/nocerino-muntari-goal-changed-milan-history](https://www.football-italia.net/170245/nocerino-muntari-goal-changed-milan-history)

 

Antonio Nocerino believes the infamous ‘ghost goal’ against Juventus was ‘the moment that changed the history of Milan,’ leading to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva exits.

The incident occurred during a 1-1 draw at San Siro on February 25, 2012, meaning the Scudetto showdown ended in a stalemate rather than allowing the Rossoneri to take control.

Juventus would eventually win the Serie A title, but that moment – when Sulley Ali Muntari’s effort crossed the line before Gigi Buffon palmed it back out – was a turning point in the push for goal-line technology.

“It wasn't after the game everyone went mad, it was straight after the goal. It was incredible, it was a goal. Buffon moved behind his goal-line when he clawed the ball,” Nocerino told The Italian Football Podcast.

“This moment changed the future of Milan. With this goal, Milan would have won the Scudetto. The big players – Zlatan and Thiago Silva – wouldn't have left the club that summer. The club would have invested more money to win as well going forward. So this ghost goal changed the history of Milan.

“If Milan had won the Scudetto, Zlatan and Thiago would have stayed, Milan for sure would have won more Scudetti.”

Ibra did return eventually and is set to start this Sunday in another clash with Juventus, even if it’s for fourth place rather than the title.

“Milan have run, run, run a lot for one year. And now the players have run out of gasoline, they've hit the reserves in the tank,” continued Nocerino.

“I really hope they can have a good sprint now until the end of the season. The Champions League is really important for them, especially after the incredible year they had.

“As for Juventus, after nine years of winning, there was a transitional season. A new coach, new players. Some of the young players will be amazing in a few years' time but now they don't have the experience.

“It is going to be difficult for Juventus and Milan to get into the Champions League because both Napoli and Atalanta have an easier run-in.

“The Juventus vs. Milan game is a Champions League playoff – whoever wins this game will qualify for the Champions League. But also let's not rule out Lazio, too.”",ACMilan,Nocerino: 'Muntari goal changed Milan history',1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/n6d05g/nocerino_muntari_goal_changed_milan_history/,2021-05-07 01:44:47

“UEFA have spent the past 10 days in conversation with the 12 clubs in an effort to agree a lesser sanction and extract a formal definitive commitment not to pursue the Super League effort. As of Wednesday, according to ESPN sources familiar with the situation, they had reached an understanding with seven clubs: Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. Inter Milan were close to an agreement as well, according to ESPN sources, though none has yet been reached.

The remaining four clubs -- Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona and AC Milan -- have so far stuck to their positions and could face the UEFA disciplinary process for, among other things, violating Article 51 of the statutes which state that ""No combinations or alliances between... clubs affiliated, directly or indirectly, to different UEFA Member Associations maybe formed without the permission of UEFA.""

HommoFroggy,1620219522.0,n5fbcb,43.0,1.0,"Wojciech Szczesny, the Juventus extreme defender, would not be happy with his current consideration within the club. The discontent stems from the interest that the Turin company has for some time in Gianluigi Donnarumma. In fact, if Donnarumma does not renew his contract with Milan, he will most likely end up at Juventus, removing the Pole's starting position. Szczesny, now in his fourth year of Juventus, has over time become one of the leaders of the Juventus locker room and has no intention of leaving Turin, where he is very well and is also well-liked by the senators (see the various Giorgio Chiellini, Gianluigi Buffon, Leonardo Bonucci, Juan Cuadrado, etc ...).

Just over a year ago, it was February 2020, Szczesny renewed his contract with Juventus until June 2024, and therefore, the bianconeri to take Donnarumma must still find a team that is willing to pay the high salary that the goalkeeper 31-year-old earns (7 million euros per season). On Szczesny, there are Tottenham, Arsenal (a team with which he has already played several seasons at the beginning of his career), and Borussia Dortmund. These disagreements with the club could undermine Szczesny's serenity in the week leading up to Juventus-Milan on Sunday 9 May, a game that promises to be decisive for both teams.

HommoFroggy,1620168206.0,n50izj,33.0,1.0,"Decisive week for the Champions League, Milan will play everything in the direct clash with Juventus on Sunday evening. **The Rossoneri environment is compact and there is no confirmation of problems in the locker room, indeed, there is maximum concentration to achieve the most important goal of the whole season after months of work and sacrifices.** The Champions League is vital from every point of view, especially the economic one. Ibrahimovic is energized, the whole club is preparing for a challenge of enormous weight, which cannot be missed.

**The Champions League will be determined above all for the market, in fact, many renewals will depend on fourth place. In particular that of Gigio Donnarumma and Hakan Calhanoglu.** The Rossoneri goalkeeper has experienced difficult moments, the pressure is starting to rise and the time for decisions is approaching. But we trust his words. **Donnarumma keeps repeating that he wants to stay in Milan, he will make the final decision and not his agents.** All right, we just have to wait. If he were to renew it would be very important for the whole club, but if he were to leave the club already has a replacement ready. Lille's Maignan will be made official as soon as Donnarumma says no to the renewal. The priority remains Gigio but plan B is already ready. The offer of 8 million is more than legitimate in this historical moment, if Donnarumma does not accept it will turn the page, as has happened with other players in the past. The decision is up to him, and we are all waiting ...

Calhanoglu has returned to scoring in the last few games, but there are no steps forward on his renewal. Milan rightly cannot be found unprepared for such an important role, **which is why in recent weeks there have been contacts for Rodrigo De Paul.** The Argentine number ten from Udinese obviously likes him very much (not just the Rossoneri), and **there have been more than one phone call with the Friulians.** The price is very high, but Milan was counting on inserting two or three technical (young) counterparts to lower their claims. **However, the player recently switched to Mino Raiola, and the change of economic strategy of his new agent has slowed Milan down**. We will see in the coming weeks if the Rossoneri insist or go on other goals for the trocar. Of course, entering the Champions League would facilitate many speeches. 

Two years ago Milan took Theo Hernandez from Real Madrid, last year Brahim Diaz (on loan), and could fish again in the Spanish capital in the summer. This time it is a zero parameter. If Lucas Vazquez does not renew with Real, Milan would be one of the most interesting teams. There are also evaluations of an athletic nature, in addition to the economic aspect, because the player is currently injured from the rupture of the Crusader. But it would be a zero opportunity and a good quality purchase for the right lane. In fact, in those areas of the field, he should take the place of Samu Castillejo, who instead has proposals from Spain (at least a couple). He is fine with Milan, but he can be one of the major suspects to start to reinforce a department in which there are always many difficulties in the goal area, and in the final phase of offensive actions.

**On his arrival to Italy:**

*“At Milan the rhythms were no different from Ukraine. The way of training yes, it was more tactical. The matches are played at a higher intensity. The first word that Billy taught me in Milanese is was “Bauscia”, I still use it today (laughs). Costacurta took care of me: we always went out to dinner together and drove me in the car. Albertini? He taught me how to cook and gave me a quick course.*

**On Galliani:** 

*“The only photo I put in the book is one with Adriano. He believed in me from the beginning, with Ariedo Braida, from that cold in Kiev… It was an important decision for the club, they believed in me and I won a Ballon d’Or… I have to say thanks to them.”*

**On AC Milan:** 

*“It’s not a team, it’s a family. When you arrive at Milanello they treat you like a family person. Coaching Milan? That’s a dream.”*

**On the Champions League final against Juventus:** 

*“Ancelotti asked me to take the first penalty kick, but I went last. As I approached the spot, my whole life was passing by. What happened next is history.”*

On the match and the standings: “It was very important to win. The team, although strong and carefree, had suffered a lot of the two defeats. We were mentally good at putting this performance on the pitch. Only two goals with 11 chances created are few. win also with a view to the next race.”

On the victory ahead of the Juve clash: “Victory is the only way to get to next week’s game well. This victory must give us the conviction of our qualities. We must be attentive and determined. We will have a week to prepare well for a very stimulating challenge.”

On Donnarumma: “Donnarumma is the goalkeeper of Milan. He has great professionalism and is fully involved in our work. He is calm, serene and focused like everyone else. All these questions outside Milanello’s work lead us to wrong paths.

“We have to think about our present and the next match and I see a group focused on these dynamics, a strong but not infallible group that will try to make the last effort to achieve an important goal for us, for the supporters who support us and the team, we need positivity.”

On what was missing in today’s game: “It doesn’t happen every match to have 11 scoring chances and this means that the manoeuvre was of a high level. To be more clinical will be important but it doesn’t happen every match to have these offensive dynamics. So you need to be cynical and determined. We must be concentrated and not allow situations that can be dangerous.”

On where the answer came after a moment of decline: “It is the team’s performance and the reaction on a mental level that gave the answer. The performances of the individuals were good. The two consecutive defeats are many and heavy but this should not underline that there were no bad performances with Sassuolo and Lazio.

“We were not in a dark period but in a period of decline, where we lost something compared to the first round. We fell but there are many causes in our decline. I have always said that the accounts are made in the end. Now we have to stay concentrate and play these 4 games with confidence and enthusiasm.”

On the first game against Juve this season: “It was a particular match. It wasn’t our best possible line-up. The match was more balanced than what the result said but Juventus has individuality that we weren’t good at stopping. We will have to field a more careful performance.”

Pioli was interviewed by DAZN at the end of the game, with his statements transcribed by MilanNews and translated below.

On asking for spirit, heart, technique and sacrifice: “Without team spirit you can’t go anywhere, we can’t afford not to do the extra race and to race to the end. Tonight I saw positive things.”

On Ibrahimovic: “We are talking about a champion, he increases the value of a team and the quality of his team-mates. Not having had him for so long penalised us, now the important thing is that he is well. Now it was difficult mentally, we had suffered two defeats and it is normal that this is the case. We reacted, the team will mature and grow a lot.”

On Ibra’s position: “I believe that often not giving points of reference to a defence can be an advantage. Emptying the central space to favour the insertions of the players is more difficult for the other team. Zlatan has a superior intelligence, he likes to do the offensive director. It’s an option that is giving us some advantages.”

On the way to play: “Mentally it wasn’t easy, it was too important a game for the table. We didn’t have the fear of playing the ball, we have to play this kind of football that requires mental effort and important application. We need to be a little more solid when our opponents have the ball, we need to be more careful in certain situations. Our goal is great, our performance must be too.”

On Calhanoglu: “He has not yet reached his potential. I really like him because he combines quantity and quality, he works for the team, he still needs to find a little more precision in assists but he is finding that awareness that he did not have in the past. me is a double-digit player, for his technique he has all the qualities to succeed, but not only for goals, also for assists.”

On the closeness of the management: “The technical area supports us on a daily basis, we are put in a position to do well and this allows us to give 100%. We are talking about football people, they know when to intervene and how to intervene and what words to use.”",ACMilan,"Pioli: “We were not in a dark period but in a period of decline, where we lost something compared to the first round.

He was a young unpolished player with tremendous fighting spirit. He was trying even when things went wrong. Instead of him we got Leao, he is a fine player don’t get me wrong, but his attitude is not something what our team needs. This is why I think that the whole thing letting Cutrone go and buying Leao instead of him was a bit of an unnecessary business. Under Ibra he could grow a lot more than Leao imo, and he is a Milanista at the end of the day and the attitude sometimes can make the difference.

He is a home-grown player and we know how much trouble we have this year with this rule.
He is a pivot like Ibra with less goals potential but known for making lot of assists, the 3 behind him will score and shine, gaining value.
He's experienced and can play both as starter or sub.
Napoli could give him on loan with a small fee, it's a budget opportunity.

I know that some of us wish to see Vlahovic or Icardi or Dzeko or Raspadori but let's be real, we already spent a lot of money and now we need to find cheap but useful players.

Rebic played a deeper role similar to CAM in the Frankfurt trident. Granted it was not 4-2-3-1, but do you see the quality of a CAM in Rebic? I think with target man Ibra and Giroud it is easier for players to adapt to CAM (compared to a technical forward). This way has the following advantages: 1) We don't have to sell either Leao or Hauge as both would get decent playing time at LW. 2) We can spend more on RW without spending on CAM. 3) We can try Pessina, and he will get decent playing time on CAM and CM and covering for double pivot. Tonali and Diaz will potentially get more minutes too.

MilanY,1624458002.0,o6dr6c,49.0,1.0,"Disregarding Maignan and Tomori and potentially losing important pieces (I actually think we will lose Leao though), we will need quite a few players for next season.

I would be extremely happy with:

Getting Diaz and Dalot back on loan with an option/obligation (with conditions) to buy, Dalot can play both sides and Diaz is versatile too.

Finalizing Giroud, I legit think this will be the most important part. Having strikers that plays similar meams that we don't have to change playstyle when Zlatan is out of play.  

I don't think we will be able to get Ziyech, but I hope that Sabitzer might come, lower fee, shorter contract. It might be hard to get a good replacement for Hakan. James/Coutinho feels like a big no. Daamsgaard would be fun, but seemingly not quite on the level we want atm for a starting player. 

My personal favorite and biggest hope is that we will be able to snatch Berardi. From what I know he was (is?) an Inter fan but fuck it, I really like him as a player and think he will suit us perfectly. 

I have not seen enough of Pobega to judge him, but maybe he can be our 4th option in midfield. It will save us a little bit of money for Berardi/Hakan replacement. AFCON might fuck us but Winter mercato might salvage it a bit. 

In the best of world we would get another fullback, midfielder and a younger striker but I don't see us spending that much. It might mot be enough for us to win any titles, but I don't see us signing more players, and at least I would be extremely happy with the mentioned mercato.",ACMilan,What would you realistic and ideal mercato be?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/o6dr6c/what_would_you_realistic_and_ideal_mercato_be/,2021-06-23 22:20:02

Ricks_Pick,1624368786.0,o5n9hf,42.0,1.0,"I Will start of by saying I am not a huge fan of Alessios past season, however you have to acknowledge his injuries during this year and having to rush him back probably didn't help him or his case. 
I Was personally of the opinion that we should sell him if he wouldn't budge on his salary to avoid another Hakan/Gigio situation (past tense) but with what has happened that has completely changed. I Think that right now, it is more important then ever to renew him, here's why.

-
Alessio is one of many pillars in the structure of Milan. Alessio is both a leader both on and off the pitch who has shown to actually love the shirt &amp; be helpful with introducing players to Milanello and the people there.

By losing Hakan &amp; Gigio (Others incoming, Samu etc.) i feel like renewing Alessio is a must, even if we renew him just for another year so that we can sell him later on for his full value, or potentially keeping him for the long run since Kjaer with his back problems &amp; what other injuries is going to prevent him from playing every game. 

-
With what has occurred i hope the fans (Maldini &amp; Co) understand what Alessio brings to the table apart from being the Captain &amp; a good player on the field.

1. No need for RW.
2. We already have quality WBs. Alexis is more of a RWB anyway and Dalot and Calabria ( who can also be 3rd CB) are good going forward. Theo is also much better going forward.
3. We can start all our best CBs and possibly all our best CMs (if we go 5 mids)
4. or start Ibra with 2 SS with Ibra droping to no 10 spot (if we go with 3 forwards). Also, i count Dias as SS here (he played that at the end of the season)
5. This one is a stretch but maybe we can keep and give more time to Pobega and Gabia

As for the downsides (other then time needed for fluidity ofc):

1. Almost no backups, but we are not much better of right now for the current formation.
2. Not much space for Hauge (also, not much difference comparing to current situation)

There is no perfect way to handle this situation. We are dealing with players that we cannot afford/do not agree with the value of the contracts being demanded while going through an imperative period of improving the club's health for long-term growth.

We could either do what we are currently doing (1), with (2) and (3) being the alternatives:

1. Use the player at an affordable contract until expiration.
2. Sell the player a year before expiration for a relatively low fee while also needing to find a proper replacement for an affordable price.
3. Overpay for a contract for a potentially unsellable player, as other clubs likely would not want to pay a transfer fee for a player with an overpriced contract, while having a significant strain on our finances until we find a suitor.

Given out financial situation, we cannot afford option 3 and it would likely severely stunt our long-term growth.   
Option 2 relies on having a suitable replacement w.r.t. price, quality, and fitting the system/role, as well as potentially diminishing the chance to make the top 4 the following season.   
I am confident the management knew it would be hard to find an agreement for a new contract with both of them since they arrived, but how much would these players be worth with one year remaining on their contracts? Who would replace them and for how much? Would these new players make the club less confident in qualifying for the Champions League? If you think our management is competent, then you can be confident they asked these questions before this past season. 

As much as I preferred the idea of receiving at least some transfer fees for Hakan/Dollarumma, we don't have the finances nor squad strength to make that beneficial.  


Keep in mind:

Our goal each season should/is to be just strong enough to likely qualify for the Champions League while being as financially healthy as possible. Therefore for the near future, our squad will and should consist of veterans on short/affordable contracts who can help us qualify for a season or two, and young talent who can provide significant ROI.   
If we place higher than 4th, cool, but it should not be our goal as long as we are owned by Elliot. Although it would help to have a relatively deep UCL run, we shouldn't invest too much in increasing that chance.  
Once Maldini/Massara/Pioli believe we have a 4th place quality squad (people who I believe in), we need to be investing as much as possible into analytics and youth scouting to sign profitable players, as well as investing in a new stadium and expanding marketing globally, maximizing our market cap.   
However many years later, Elliot will sell a much more attractive and healthy Milan to (hopefully) a passionate, yet smart billionaire. Only then will we be able to afford big contracts, specifically for players who justify their cost i.e., not Hakan and sort of Dollarumma.",ACMilan,Why letting Hakan/Dollarumma go for free was the correct decision,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/o504f3/why_letting_hakandollarumma_go_for_free_was_the/,2021-06-22 01:11:32

Not only do we sell our talented youth products, but they are for pennies compared to other clubs. I fear that Pobega will be the next youth product we prematurely ship out and replace him with someone who is only slightly better.

Lost a lot of balls in the offensive field and need to run a lot because of it.

Milanoate,1623513209.0,ny9tmc,21.0,1.0,"Each team has 25 spots, 4 of which must be for Milan-trained players (homegrown), and 8 of which must be for Italy-trained players (including Milan-trained). The definition is that player spent 3 years in the club or the country between 15-21. If we don't satisfy the standard, that spot is void. 

Players born in 2000 or after and have spent two uninterrupted years in the club don't need to be registered. So Daniel Maldini, Plizarri and Colombo don't occupy the spots (but realistically, they may not be able to play CL anyway).

25 plays is not a large roster for at least half a season, and we should not waste them if we don't have to. After the departure of Donnarumma brothers, we don't have any homegrown players other than Calabria and Gabbia. That means we can only register for 23 players.

Moreover, we have Romagnoli and Tonali counted as trained in Italy. Caldara and Conti are returning from loan, but not sure they would leave, but they could, together with Romagnoli.

It would be a huge waste to void 3-4 positions out of the 25. I hope when we bring in new players, they can be registered for CL.

Among those who qualify registration rules, who are the players we should target or retain?

Homegrown players:

Locatelli (nearly 0 possibility)

Cristante

Pobega (I think considering homegrown status we should retain him)

Petagna

Cutrone (not good enough for Milan)

If Caldara, Romagnoli, and Conti all leave (which is a real possibility), we need to add another Italian-trained player. The list is of course huge but here are some interesting names (some make more sense than others)

Samkazi23,1623434977.0,nxmdb5,107.0,1.0,"#Tournament Opener: ITALY VS TURKEY

Italy field the expected XI in their Euro 2020 opener, with Domenico Berardi and Manuel Locatelli stepping in, while Turkey rely on Hakan Calhanoglu and Burak Yilmaz.

It kicks off at the Stadio Olimpico at 20.00 UK time (19.00 GMT).

This is the opening game of the entire tournament and also of Group A, which also includes Switzerland and Wales.

The Azzurri lost Stefano Sensi and Lorenzo Pellegrini, who pulled out of the competition due to muscular injuries, while Marco Verratti has not yet recovered from a knee issue.

As expected, Roberto Mancini sticks with the same XI that beat the Czech Republic 4-0 in a friendly last week.

That means Alessandro Florenzi and Leonardo Spinazzola as the full-backs, Locatelli stepping into midfield and Berardi rather than Federico Chiesa in a trident attack with Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne.

Turkey are very dangerous on the counter-attack and hope to defend well before quick turnovers.

There were suggestions that Sassuolo defender Kaan Ayhan would move into midfield as extra protection, partnering West Bromwich Albion’s Okay Yokuslu.

Instead, it’s a more traditional choice with Ozan Tufan.

Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu pulls the strings behind striker Burak Yilmaz.

There is another Serie A representative in the form of Juventus defender Merih Demiral, while Cengiz Under is on the bench.

**Turkey: U Cakir; Celik, Demiral, Soyuncu, Meras; Karaman, Tufan, Yokuslu, Yazici, Calhanoglu; Yilmaz**

**Turkey bench: Gunok, Bayindir, Under, Tokoz, Antalyali, Kabak, Unal, Kokcu, Can Kahveci, Ayhan, Muldur, Dervisoglu**

**Italy: G Donnarumma; Florenzi, Bonucci, Chiellini, Spinazzola; Barella, Jorginho, Locatelli; Berardi, Immobile, Insigne**

**Italy bench: Sirigu, Meret, Di Lorenzo, Belotti, Pessina, Emerson, Chiesa, Acerbi, Cristante, Bernardeschi, Raspadori, Bastoni**

shalom82,1623392086.0,nx908u,47.0,1.0,"As many have noted, Hakan's attitude seems to be to try and nail the euros to secure a higher offer from elsewhere, knowing that if he fails he can always accept Milan's contract offer. It's a logical move from him, but speaks very poorly of his commitment to Milan and makes me question what his performance will be like if he stays, especially as it would be a ""second best not-quite-what-I'd-hoped-for"" situation for him.

How should Milan handle this situation? We can't just pull a Maignan here, as it's a delicate role where we need someone who is already tactically smart and ready to play in that position - no Moncada talents, but tested players. Which means high prices. Unfortunately we need to spend that money on a right winger (the role where we most desperately need an upgrade) and, given Ibra's worrying health, a striker that isn't Giroud. That alone is going to be another 25mln euros if we're lucky. 

Given our priorities in other areas, and the fact that we're already shelling out a decent amount on Maignan, Tomori and Tonali, how do you think we should allocate our expenses in light of the Hakan situation? Should we just accept his shit, hope that he plays a mediocre Euros and renew him for a modest amount, knowing he won't be too happy to be at Milan and that the fans might have had enough of his pussyfooting? Or should we just shell out for a new CAM? And if the latter, what would you do about the striker / RW situation?",ACMilan,The Hakan situation,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nx908u/the_hakan_situation/,2021-06-11 14:14:46

Since the recent passing of our beloved byhoskyy almost a year ago, and with the growth of our subreddit since then, in activity and subs, we've noticed we could use a new moderator.

There are some prerequisites and specific things we think we're in need of to improve the quality of the subreddit for you guys.

1. Most importantly, you need to be active and have been active for at least 6 months, but the longer the better. This subreddit is still close-knit enough that we can recognise most active users, so someone like that is who we'll be looking for.


2. We are specifically looking for someone who has in depth knowledge of CSS and has the ability to potentially update and incorporate cool things into our subreddits stylesheet. You can still apply if you have no experience with it, but you'll be less likely to be asked.

3. Be active and available when games are on to help clear out the spam 

4. Bonus if you can speak or understand Italian

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a link to a google form to fill out these basic options if you're interested](https://forms.gle/YeMR2ySYEuLZTqMy6)

Or alternatively you can DM Mod Mail with the answers

&amp;nbsp;

Just as an aside, if nobody who's interested seems like a good fit or meets what we're looking for, we won't just Mod someone for the sake of it.

And if you don't get moderated it doesn't mean anything against you as a person or your value as a member of our community - obviously.",ACMilan,r/ACMilan is looking for a new Moderator,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/nrzvh8/racmilan_is_looking_for_a_new_moderator/,2021-06-04 16:13:50

All the transfer news are saying Milan is looking for a full back who can play as a back up for Calabria and Theo. And the thing is on paper Calabria already has a back up in Kalulu. So again, on paper, we should be looking for someone who plays on the left or plays on both sides but mostly on the left. 

However all the names that I saw are RBs who can play on the left not the opposite. So this gives me a signal that Kalulu isn't seen as main Calabria back up.

Malding_human_being,1622635177.0,nqk569,44.0,1.0,"I think a lot of people right now are choosing to ignore how important chalanoglu has been for us. I know, he had lots of games where he played very poorly, but the numbers talk, he had many assists and created a ton of chances for us. Anyway, while for the Donnarumma situation Maldini didn't have anything to do with it, and Donnarumma willingly chose to wait for the last days just to have more power over his contract, I think losing chala for 0 does not look good for our financies. I don't know what his requests are, but if it's like just a 1 million difference between offer and request I think it should be done. De Paul is not cheap, and I think it's a very big risk to spend this much without getting much back. I really think that if we can keep chala and focus on getting maybe some young players and spend money maybe on a second left back it's better.


Another note, we have a lot of potential players that I think would be better with a 3 5 2 formation, for example, Pobega looks really good but neither chala's role or Kessie role are suited for him, just like I think that putting Tonali in that very very very hard role of midfielder box to box is not really the best for him. Even De Paul is not in his perfect role if we exchange him with chala.

For Saelemaekers we need a better player than Casti, i don't know if Someone will arrive. And at the end probably Giroud and a 3rd for Ibra.

Dragaugh,1627651473.0,oukjaw,6.0,1.0,"Hakim Ziyech is still in the interest of AC Milan. The former Ajax player would love a move to Italy, especially since a place at San Siro - unlike at Chelsea - is an attractive option.

That's what La Gazzetta dello Sport writes on Friday in an extensive story about Milan's search for reinforcements. The Rossoneri want to attract a replacement for the transferee Hakan Calhanoglu, who transferred to Internazionale. In June, Ziyech was already on the front page of the pink sports newspaper for that reason and the 28-year-old playmaker is still an option.

According to Gazzetta, Milan has kept contacts with Ziyech and his business manager warm and the former player of SC Heerenveen, FC Twente and Ajax is fascinated by an Italian adventure at San Siro. Also because in Stefano Pioli's team there is a base place for him, while at Chelsea he is not sure of that.

Milan already did business with Chelsea earlier this summer with the transfers of Olivier Giroud and Fikayo Tomori, so the relationship with the Londoners is excellent. Therefore, the negotiations on the possible transfer of Ziyech should not pose too many problems. A rental deal with (mandatory) option to buy is most likely.

Ziyech, who in the meantime is just running with Chelsea in the preparation, is not the only candidate at Milan. Croatian international Nikola Vlasic (CSKA Moscow, ex-Everton) is also mentioned in Italian media as a possible reinforcement. In addition, Spanish youth international Brahim Diaz has been rented again from Real Madrid.

This can challenge for the league. Given that Leao or Hauge can come in for Rebic. Tonali, bakayoko and pobega are all quality serie a midfielders to challenge the midfield. Ibra is hungry. Let's see what the 3 behind the striker can do. I feel like Pioli managed them pretty well last year, so with an improvement from last year, given that calha will be replaced by a better Diaz and we will buy 2 more to fill up those roles. I feel good. Saelemakers can also be an extremely strong weapon. He played so so well last year in my opinion given his expectations and to be honest he looked good most of the time.

RossoneroM99,1627563672.0,otx1cj,49.0,1.0,"First of all I want so say that in principle I like the idea of Maldini and co. and appreciate what they already did for our club. We are in the Champions League and had a very successful season. All this speaks for them but man .. this mercato is so underwhelming its crazy. We lost 2 keyplayers and already spent so much money. I understand that the departure from Donnarumma and Hakan blocked many operations and therefore we are a bit limited in our actions. Despite that I still don‘t like how we act in the market. This isn‘t Europa League. We are in the Champions League and need to act like that. This loan+buy formula is so overused and make us in trouble. We block every mercato because we need to buy the players we loaned out. Therefore a development is very hard to do. We can see it this year. Stand now we have the same squad + Ballo and Giroud and also lost two key players. It‘s not the right way. If we want someone we need to act. The Kaio Jorge saga.. the Warren Bondo saga.. the Vlasic saga ..I can‘t understand how we want to negotiate if we always want the things just on our terms. We need to understand that we are not playing with Brescia. We also tried it with Tomori and it didn‘t work. Its quite embarassing how we act. Then I also read „Maldini waits for the market oppurtunity at the end of the mercato“ like its clear that there will be a oppurtunity? The oppurtunitys are right now. Sabitzer is on the market, Vlasic is there and many many others. If we wait it can work out but it also can be a big failure. Why the risk? Another problem is that if we wait there are orher problems to come: A foreigner needs to learn the language, they need to get comfortable, they need some weeks to understand the tactics and so many other things. I hope it will turn out as a great mercato and in some weeks I can see how wrong I was but right now this is the situation",ACMilan,This Mercato is so underwhelming,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/otx1cj/this_mercato_is_so_underwhelming/,2021-07-29 21:01:12

I hope there is some truth to this because he would be my ideal candidate for RW. More than Ziyech, Sabitzer, Berardi, or any other ones I have heard of so far. He seems to have all the ingredients to be a world-class player and seems to be somewhat undervalued right now.

We also currently have 5 midfielders. If they decide to keep Pobega (and I want them to keep him) and can't sell Krunic then probably they won't sign 6th midfielder.

Then there is left wing situation. I honestly think neither Leao nor Hauge have long term future at Milan at this point. Hauge doesn't fit Pioli's system and won't get chances, while Leao will keep being unstable. So ideally selling both and getting someone new would be the most desirable solution but again hard to achieve.

160rm,1626437673.0,olfoad,15.0,1.0,"As we all know, club's transfer budget these days isn't very big, to say the least. And with that in mind, I think that club's current strategy is not fitting. 

As you may see, majority of recent (and so recent) purchases came from top 5 leagues, and most of them are players that didn't succeed in their clubs, or are free (and/or old). Obvious problem with that is that it's a gamble (will that player succeed in your club then or is he good enough), and if you want to buy proven player, you have to spend huge money (which isn't an option anymore). Only player that did come from outside is Hauge, and reason why is obvious,

What I'm suggesting is, maybe it's time to change the game, and focus more on market pool outside of top 5 leagues, where you can still get great players, but pay a lot less. For top 20 leagues, hire at least one guy per league, who will live there, follow that league religiously, and get reports. That's not a big expense. There are so many talented players there that go under the radar until smaller top 5 league club picks them up, and sells them to big ones for huge profit. Portugese clubs like Benfica and Porto have done that for years (but with South American players) and made like 400 mil. € from that in last 10 or so years. Obviously you won't rely on that completely, but it's a good option to have. 

For example, trying to sign Olmo from Dinamo was a good idea, as he is today worth at least 2.5-3x times Leipzig paid them (22 mil. €). Today, I'd recommend another player from same club, Luka Ivanusec, which can be bought for similar price, and will be a future star. Already was in recent U21 Euro top team. And he plays two most scarce positions in our team, CAM and RM.",ACMilan,Transfer market strategy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/olfoad/transfer_market_strategy/,2021-07-16 20:14:33

Not going to be a popular thing to say among the fellow Milanisti but Hakan is a pretty big loss at attacking midfielder. I hate to say it but it’s true.

Seems like the back line is mostly intact and Maignan is a solid signing. I am excited to see Giroud take over at striker, but hopefully Ibra plays/scores as much as possible. Very confident in the attack, not so much in the middle, unlike last season.

He saved that penalty in Europa qualifiers which made AC Milan to participate in the Europa League 2021. He also made many good saves which other GK can't even think in Serie A. He is the main reason for Milan qualifying for Champions League. He is not like Hakan to join Inter Or Juventus (our rivals). He join PSG for money and trophies. Which he can't get in Milan. In money point of view, Milan lacks and upto previous decade, Milan can give salary of player whatever they ask. Now, thinks are changed. We should give the players right salary in order to keep them. Everyone including Totti, Maldini plays for many first, Even though they were loyal. Not they play when the club didn't pay anything. I agree Milan give €8 million for Gigi but he deserves even more. When Maldini did his defensive duty great in Milan. Our team able to give whatever he wants. Now things are changed. We should make ourselves great in the upcoming 5 years. We should qualify for UCl for all the years. And we should win Scudetto . Then we can  offer what our players want. I believe Donnarumma will play for Milan in his 30s when we required him. 
This is just an opinion article. Yours views may vary but I am telling why Gigi should not be scold like Hakan. In this season, Donna is also reason for qualifying to UCL. If he leaves in previous year, we get about somewhat €40 million money but didn't get our UCL spot. If a player doesn't interested in salary we offer, there's no need for a club to resign him and selling in next year for profit. As a Rossoneri fan, I don't get offended by Gigi's action because he never joins Juventus.

With the majority of players having returned after their holidays, **Coach Pioli** is now preparing for them to start working again. He began doing so with today’s press conference at **14:00 CEST**.

**BERGAMO DELIGHT**  
*""We all enjoyed it, but only for a few days, at least this was the case for me. I immediately started thinking about the exciting things that will be coming our way this season. We’ve thrown ourselves into the new year: today is the first day, it's as thrilling as always and it’ll be great to see my players again.""*

**THE WEEKS OF WORK AHEAD**  
*""We've started a little earlier with the aim of doing the right things calmly and efficiently, to prepare well and avoid injuries. We want to make the most of this period, we had a long and demanding season, so I hope the lads are rested and ready. We’re back here again, and the start of the new season will come soon.*""

**THE TRANSFER MARKET**  
*""The Club wants to try to make AC Milan competitive, with our journey beginning a year and a half ago. We still need to grow and improve, to raise the level of the team. Like everyone else, I would prefer to have the whole squad from day one but I also know the dynamics at play, we will do things right so we can have an AC Milan that is consistent in performance and results. I've already spoken with Maignan, we've got a great guy, now he'll have to rest after the Euros to be fit and ready for the season.""*

**GOODBYES AND PARTICIPATION**  
*""Kessie has grown a lot, much like many of his teammates, he’s very strong and he has given so much to the team. We know how important he is and at the same time how happy he is to be at AC Milan. We spoke to each other, he took some rest, he got married, and now he will go to the Olympics: I found him to be calm, motivated, and ready to come back as strong as before. I bonded a lot with the players last season, Gigio and Hakan gave so much to this team up until the final day. I must thank them for everything, they have made their choices, and we now have to go our separate ways. I’m sure I’ll find another motivated group that are ready to grow and to give their all, that are ready to challenge themselves. We need quality players because you can go far when you have quality and spirit. I’m interested in the arrival of quality players, who want to play for AC Milan and who want to work with us. I expect growth from all my players, as much from Leão as from the many other players.""* 

**THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE**  
*""The success we have this season will be determined on the pitch, we must prepare well and need to complete the team, we’ll work to be ready for the elite level of the Champions League.""*

**THE CAPTAIN**  
*""The captain has always been and still is Alessio Romagnoli. We have more captains within the team, and, together with the Club, we’ll establish the vice-captains.""*

**IBRA, CALABRIA, AND BENNACER’S CONDITIONS**  
*""I've spoken to Zlatan every day. Today, I found him to be doing well, but it will take ten to fifteen days before he's back out on the pitch. The prospects are looking good, we hope to have him available for the start of the season. Calabria paid us a visit yesterday, he’ll have to work separately for a short time, while Isma will work alongside the group from today.""*

**SIMON KJÆR**  
*""He went through a delicate experience. Many were amazed at his reaction, but we weren’t surprised: we know all about his human qualities. We’ve spoken often, including after yesterday’s game, and we’ll also do so in the next few days to determine how long we’ll give him to rest after a demanding European Championship.""*

**TOMORI SIGNING ON**  
*""Fikayo has displayed important characteristics and got used our way of playing, showing conviction and mentality in the process. He’s also always given 110%. The Club pushed hard for a player who is already important for this team. But he’s also someone who could play an even more vital role going forward.""*

**THE QUALITY OF THE LEAGUE**  
*""Many teams will have the same objective: the Scudetto or a place in the top four. I’m disappointed that Antonio Conte will no longer be involved, but it’s exciting to welcome back Allegri, Spalletti, Sarri and Mourinho. Facing them means growing and being able to make further improvements.""*

**TACTICS AND POSITIONS ON THE PITCH**  
*""I’m open to all solutions. The important thing is to put players in a position where they’re able to perform at their best. We need to try to take the game to our opponents and dominate. I’m not anchored to fixed positions, our system will become increasingly fluid during our build-up play and when we attack.""*",ACMilan,"PIOLI: ""WE HAVE TO BE AMBITIOUS"" - The Coach's words on the team's first day back at Milanello",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/og8iib/pioli_we_have_to_be_ambitious_the_coachs_words_on/,2021-07-08 22:37:29

They need to play, here, at Milan, guided by Kjaer, Franck and Zlatan to become great players. Milan is one of the only teams where they would be able to evolve, as the young players (especially the italians that are with the team since even 10 years) have lived there for a few years, they speak the language and they are already well integrated with the major team. Also, they have already established players to teach them, such as Zlatan, Kjaer and even Paolo.

Alan:

&amp;#x200B;

 Well Ian it's been a terrific European Cup final with some end to end 

football yet we haven't seen any goals. What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Ian:

&amp;#x200B;

 Well Alan, for me Dollaruma and Schmeichel have been absolutely terrific

and whatever side ends up on top, their going to be man of the match for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Alan: 

I couldn't agree more, Ian. Here we are folks. 89th minute of normal 

time, 4 minutes of stoppage time added and Denmark have the ball.

&amp;#x200B;

Simon Kjaer to Delaney.

The pass was off but Delaney does well to keep poessession and sends it back to Kjaer

The Denmark captain has looked lackluster in the final minutes of the game.

Kjaer again as he sends a long ball to Braithwaite but Di Lorenzo it there to challenge

and oh my word, Di Lorenzo has slipped and Braitewaite is suddenly free running into a dangerous area.

Braithwaite has Dolberg on his right

................................

He shoots!

................................

Oh! It was a decent effort into the bottom right connor.

Dollaruma had to really stretch to get their. Dolberg looks absolutely furious

&amp;#x200B;

Ian:

 Fantastic save for Dollaruma, it's difficult to believe he's only 22.

Corner to Denmark

................................

The corner goes in towards the back post, Dolberg is there but he falls to the ground and Denmark and appealing for a penalty. The ref says play on.

 Throw in for Italy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hold on a second. The ref seems to be communicating with the VAR team.

&amp;#x200B;

I think he's going to look at it Alan.

&amp;#x200B;

... 

&amp;#x200B;

Alan:

Here's the replay ... ... ... oh dear I think that's a penalty.

Ian:

I agree with you Alan, Bonnuci clearly throws an elbow into Dolberg's back as he goes into the air.

&amp;#x200B;

The referee continues to watch the replay, and it appears that 

................................

He's given the penalty! Italy cannot believe it and Wembley is going absolutely wild.

................................

Dolberg steps to the penalty spot, but what's this?

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like Denmark's captain, Simon Kjaer is trying to take the penalty  ... ... ... and it looks like he's agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh Steve, you can't say there hasn't been any drama this Euro Cup final.

&amp;#x200B;

It indeed looks like Simon Kjaer will take the penalty against his former A.C. Milan teammate

Dollaruma.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ The ref blows his whistle \~

&amp;#x200B;

Dollarume saves it but Kjaer follows up after the bounce and 

&amp;#x200B;

Given we will now have 6 central midfielders, this makes the most sense to me as the new additions will compete with Krunic for depth. It also alleviates the need of finding another attacking player in the market as you can have Saele/Diaz rotate at RW and Leao/Rebic at LW.

I also think we will see more tactical flexibility from Pioli in general, we already saw him go to a 3 ATB in game 1 at the end.

sonictank,1630315274.0,peejc4,26.0,1.0,"We all know the situation with Franck Kessie. Given the circumstances we have an option to bench him for a season, play him as a substitute and choose to push other players, and as any major decision in football (or life, as football is life) there are ups and downs of the possibility. I'll try to analyse both cases here, but would like to hear your opinion too.

Lets start with the **Cons** of benching Kessie:

* obviously, worse team performance and consequentially worse results. He is the engine of our play and our midfield
* if we play him of the bench there's a possibility he psychologically checks out, waiting and preparing for the next season for which he knows he won't be in Milan. Unfocused players are usually just a shadow of their prime self, so we'd be getting an average Kessie instead of a beast Kessie.

Now with the **Pros:**

* before everything - we send a message to any other guys thinking of not renewing to sort their shit out and either renew or ask for a transfer on time, otherwise they risk sitting out a season. Sitting out a season is no good for any player, their value drops and their form suffers.
* we give more space to Tonali and Bakayoko, who will be Milan players in the future. Tonali especially needs it because a player needs to play in order to grow, and that kid can really shine and make us think about ""Kessie Who?"" in a couple of years.
* we deny Kessie of playing in the CL at least for a year, which may sound like a childish way to deal things, but often football negotiations are childish. Good luck with playing CL in Spurs.

While there's only two cons, the first one is like a major argument for us, and a lot of it depends upon the ability for other guys (Sandro and Baka) to fulfil his shoes. It's also a very thin line of estimate whether the impact on our results will be significant or not. For example if we would have finished 2nd in Serie A with Kessie and 4th without him, then there's no big difference and we can afford to sit him. On the other hand, if the difference means reaching one additional stage in CL and/or being/not-being in top4 at the end of the season, then he has to play like all the time.

It's difficult to analize this as a bystander and just a fan, I really hope Pioli and management have a better insight in all of these things.",ACMilan,Pros and cons of benching Kessie,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/peejc4/pros_and_cons_of_benching_kessie/,2021-08-30 17:21:14

Personal opinion here, Samu isn't the best player on the pitch, doubt he is even at our level yet, but he is the one who always gives his best to the team, always remains professional passionate and fights for the color, as is shown in the Cagliari match last season. I'm so furious and disgusted with any of those fans who treat such a dedicated and loyal person as if he is something trash, unwanted. There can be memes and such but everything has its limit, and dear, with all respect, they have no rights to call the likes of Donna, Hakan and even Kessie, Roman as ""disloyal"", ""ungrateful"", ""money-grabbing"", etc. when they don't even know how to love one of their own.

Cagliari**, the first match of the 2021/22 season at San Siro, which also sees the Rossoneri fans return to their stadium. Coach **Stefano Pioli** spoke to journalists at his press conference in Milanello to discuss the challenges the team will face tomorrow, with the game scheduled for 20.45 CEST. As usual, the press conference was broadcasted on **Milan TV** and on the **AC Milan Official App**.

**TOMORROW EVENING**

""*We've been thinking about the game all week. We have an objective – start the season well. We’re coming from a hard-fought but well-deserved victory. Tomorrow we'll face a well-structured team like Cagliari, who are difficult to play against. Against Spezia they pressed hard, but at this point in the season the league table doesn't create pressure. We don't know what their attitude will be like, we'll have to be good at reading the moment. It’ll be difficult to repeat last year's away results, so it's clear that improving the results at San Siro is a target and we want to try and start that tomorrow”*.

**ALWAYS GROWING**

""*I am motivated by my players’ desire to work attentively and with quality all the time. Every match will make us grow and every challenge gives me ideas on what we can work on to improve. We can prepare the best we can, but still you can have to read the matches on the day. We've done well this summer, both in training and in friendlies; we've played with fluency, trying to keep the game under control. We have to try to be more dangerous, to try to do better in the final third”*.

""*Pellegri showed up in good but not quite yet top condition, we're doing all the necessary evaluations to allow him to carry on working; he won't be called up tomorrow, I hope to have him fully back with the group after the break. Bennacer's condition has improved, he's ready to play; I expect a big performance from him because he’s got everything. Ibra and Kessie are doing well, I hope to have them back available with the group soon after the international break*”.

&amp;#x200B;

**INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS / 2**

""*Compared to last year I’ve found Díaz much more ready. We want to play and improve, and this also applies to Sandro – his growth is very important. It's normal to have difficult moments, but he managed to work on his mistakes and now he’s much more of a complete midfielder. To be competitive we need a lot of starters, Krunić is one of them; he plays in both phases of the game with great intelligence. I'll make my choices match by match, but everyone has to be ready”*.

**THE FANS’ BUZZ**

""*We've always felt the fans with us and I think it was a mutual thing. It was great to see them back with us in Genoa on Monday or at Milanello this morning, it will be exciting to have them back at the stadium tomorrow. We're young in terms of age but not as players or as a team. We'll only get positive effects from the return of the fans, we want to take all the energy we can from them, and make the most of the energy of San Siro”*.

**EUROPE**

""*Our minds are now only on tomorrow's game, we want to be ready. We really wanted to play in the Champions League. We know it's the most important competition and we'll do everything we can to be competitive in a difficult round. The history of this Club should not be a burden, but an incentive. We will play every European game to our maximum potential”*.

**FROM CAGLIARI TO CAGLIARI**

""*In these months we have grown in awareness, compactness and quality. The team goes onto the pitch with clear ideas and they try to carry them out, even during the inevitable difficult moments. We have to maintain enthusiasm, always working at our best; be fluid, mentally present – we want to excite our fans. We have definitely improved, last year we could have been a surprise but this year we are not: we have to reaffirm this, try and play proactive football and always be more dangerous than our opponents”*.",ACMilan,"Stefano Pioli's press conference, AC Milan v Cagliari: ""WE'LL MAKE THE MOST OF THE ENERGY OF SAN SIRO""",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/pda8s4/stefano_piolis_press_conference_ac_milan_v/,2021-08-28 21:58:21

They are big names and they made Seria A more attractive last year and it's not just about them, the PL clubs take so cheap all the best players from all the others leagues and if it keep going this way PL ( and PSG ) will become the Super League. Right now, Serie A and Bundesliga are the only leagues that give me that feel good moments about football and I just hope that this will not change.

AC Milan as it is now, it's giving such a good vibe as a football club even if it we struggle to sign or renew players, but we still have our integrity and passion for the sport and this you can't buy.

MilanGuy,1630100774.0,pcwvs2,70.0,1.0,"Even though it seems he and his agent are making excessive demands, it's the club's fault for letting it come this far. Now Kessie is one year away from leaving for free and has all the leverage. If we had offered him 4.5m rising to 5m with bonuses last summer I'm 99% sure he would have accepted it. 

Until now, I was mostly understanding about the Donnarumma and Çalhanoglu situations. Bad agents and too high demands. But it seems like a trend is emerging. As of now, Romagnoli will leave for free as well. Unless that changes, we're set to lose out on around *175 million Euros* (Transfermarkt valutation of the four of them). To me, that would be unacceptable, a major management failure.

All teams lose a player for free every now and then, but it appears that our stingy contract policy is costing us massively. We should adapt a strategy where every key player whose contract is about to enter its final two years is told to renew *before* the summer or be transfer listed. That way we a) get something for them while their value is high or b) keep our most important assets on long-term contracts. We should have approached Çalhanoglu and Donnarumma in 2019 ago with that mindset. 

It appears to me that the management wants to keep wages low while relying on our (admittedly excellent) scouting network. But as we can see it results in losing our best players. If we ever want to return to the top we need to hold on to them. 

I write this because I love Kessie, I think he's our best player, and it would destroy me to see him leave because of (what I see as) bad management.",ACMilan,"I have stood by our management since they came in.

KrisKiko,1630073456.0,pco4ow,75.0,1.0,"What I wanna talk about is what a big difference of a leader is Ibrahimovic from Ronaldo. I am not here to put down Ronaldo, he is a splendid striker and everything. He scored over 20 goals every season. But it strikes me down that everyone thinks of Ronaldo as he is the one and only perfect player, people saying Juve was unable to use him yet he scored 1/30 free kicks which is funny tbh. People saying that he is the one true leader but what I see is just an arrogant man working only for himself. 

Now we have Ibrahimovic who joined Milan with a saying ""bring the team to where it belongs"". I am not saying that he himself carried us to the champions league, since he was missing most of the games and he is a bit old lets be honest (many injuries). It was the entirety of the team who brought us to CL, especially Kessie, Theo, Kjaer and some other honorable mentions. 

The difference I see is that Ronaldo came to Juventus which was already on 7 consecutive scudettos by saying ""I want a challenge"" and after one shit season he straight just wants to leave by saying he reached his objective of 100 goals, which for a player with 5 ballon d'ors and 5 CLs is actually not much in my opinion. On the other side we have Ibrahimovic who came to Milan who at the time  was offering nothing to him other than shame and bitterness to his career but since he joined most of our players who were seen as low quality have become more confident, just better (kjaer, calabria, kessie also, theo,...). Again I am not saying this is all Ibra's work (Pioli did his job aswell) but I think his seriousness and experience gave our players a lot to work with. 

In the end what I am trying to say is that Ronaldo and his fans present him as the leader he is not, while Ibra actually is a leader and no one speaks about it.

1.Roma, tomori and kjaer as cbs. Gabbia and kalulu as backup

2. Diaz as no 10. Krunic as backup

3.Bennacer and kessie as the midfielders. We have been linked to alot of midfielders in recent days. Presumably will have atleast 5 cm. tonali, bakayoko, and adli.as of now we dont have any natural backup for diaz but maybe thats the plan because we could easily play a midfield 3 so it makes that we are getting alot of midfielders other than because of bennacer and kessie going to african cup of nation later this year

4. Theo as lwb. Balo toure as back up. I was first abit confused as to why are we getting another offensive lb as well but as a lwb it makes sense.

5. Clabria, alexis and florenzi as rwb. 

6. Ibra and leao as 2 strikers. Rebic and  giroud as backup but its very interchangeable

7. So now it makes sense why we didn’t try hard to sign up proper Rw because we dont need a rw although the lastest news about the crutone guy is abit worrying .

**Corona, Messias, and the new number 10:** Vitiello confirms that Corona and Messias are options considered by Milan, but he adds that Milan might be looking for 2 new signings in this last week rather than bringing only one signing thus only the number 10. Primarily Messias and Corona are being considered as RWs to improve that flank. **BUT, they can be considered to be signed as a pair so to give Pioli more options in the frontline.** The Corona situation is a little bit difficult says Vitiello, because of some sort of issue with Corona's parent club before he was transferred to Porto. 

**Kessie situation:** Basically Maldini has a salary cap and cannot go above that cap. Vitiello says that both Milan and Kessie want to continue together, he reports that **Kessie has refused 2 offers from the Premier League which were higher offers than what he is asking from us at this moment. What Milan is offering is 1 or 1.5 mil away from what Kessie is asking, thus Milan offering around 6 or 6.5 and Kessie asking something between 7 or 8 mil. At the moment we are in a stalemate, one of the two actors should make a step forward for the negotiations to continue and a solution to be found.** Milan will try to make the impossible to keep Kessie.

*""It was great to meet the fans again, they welcomed us with enthusiasm. We have to keep this spirit. We know many ways to play but it is the spirit that will make the difference. I explained yesterday's statements to the team and I'm sure we are stronger, both I and the team. Perhaps the adjective ready is more correct, we are more ready but we must be aware that there are strong teams like Inter and Juventus. We had players outside like Kessie and Ibra, someone new like Florenzi and someone who maybe it will come but we will have to maintain this team spirit.""*

**On the performances of Tonali and Krunic.**

*""We build up with top full backs and the midfielders had set-up and cover duties. Tonali and Krunic were very good and communicated well. They played a match of quality and quantity. Saelemamekers is a very good player between the lines, he needs to improve. in the last game but he is a player who has grown a lot and can be decisive. We tried suffering to end the game and this is the right spirit..""*

**On the market.**

*""I don't know how the market will develop. The management is very active and is ready to seize opportunities. I am very happy with the team I have, I found them wanting to improve, attentive and eager to do well. If a quality player arrives. many better but we are not bound to 4-2-3-1 or other modules, the schemes are fixed on the board then things change on the pitch. I try to make the most of the characteristics of the players I have available. It's a pity Romagnoli doesn't play. He's a very good guy and he's training very well; maybe I could even play three in defense.""*",ACMilan,"Stefano Pioli, ""It was great to meet the fans again, they welcomed us with enthusiasm.

Hass_s,1629640849.0,p9cyqv,4.0,1.0,"**The Rossoneri head coach had his say at Milanello ahead of Sampdoria v AC Milan**

&amp;#x200B;

**EVEN STRONGER**  
*""I think it's the strongest AC Milan that I’ve had. The players are much more aware and grown, I’ve found guys like Tonali and Leão to be more mature. Tomorrow, there will be absentees, but the whole group is solid: we want to win all the games, and if we combine humility and ambition we’ll be able to do well. We’ll also have a stage to perform on that we wanted at all costs, the Champions League, in which we want to try and be protagonists.""*

**THE OPPONENTS**  
*""Sampdoria are a team that defend very well, they have quality up front and a clear identity. They are dangerous on set pieces; it’ll certainly be a difficult opening match. We’re doing well and we want to start in the best possible way by winning tomorrow night's match.""*

**NEW ARRIVALS**  
*""I’m very happy with the new arrivals: They’re all winners and they're all experienced at a high level, with important mentalities. They know what it means to win and have come into a group that is much more motivated than before and eager to work well. We’ve done everything necessary to be ready and to play well, starting from tomorrow.""*

**ON THE EVE OF THE MATCH**  
*""I’m excited because the beginning always provides special feelings. I know that we are at a great Club with high expectations, so we are proud to wear these colours. I’m sure of our work and convinced of our quality and the desire to feel connected. And I'm excited about the idea of seeing our fans, who will provide us with the desire to go beyond our limits.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**INDIVIDUALS / TONALI**  
*""We’ll all have to pass weekly exams and even several times a week with the arrival of the Champions League. I’m convinced that I’m coaching guys with good qualities and values who are developing well, and Sandro is one of them. He has qualities that few have, he takes more responsibility in the most difficult games and must continue on this path. I think he’s growing well and in a consistent manner.""*

**INDIVIDUALS / MAIGNAN**  
*""I’m very happy with Mike. He’s a guy who is full of desire, possesses great quality, he’s very curious and always tries to learn. From his gameplay to the building out from the back, he’s settled in very well. He’s a very strong goalkeeper who will certainly make a contribution.""*

**INDIVIDUALS / IBRA AND KESSIE**  
*""Next week will be very important for Ibra because he will reach a peak in terms of the work he’s carrying out to recover. If everything goes well, he’ll be able to return to the group during the international break. He’s our leader, both in terms of his charisma and his technical ability; he’s a very important point of reference for us and is highly motivated. Franck had an unusual summer, but he’s been very calm and focused. I believe that both parties want to continue together, but I’ve seen a relaxed player who can’t wait to return to the team.""*

**INDIVIDUALS / GIROUD**  
*""He’s a great professional and a person of substance. Furthermore, he’s a very intelligent player. He knows where to move on the pitch and is able to attack in behind or play a supporting role. He’s also a fantastic finisher in the penalty area. He has a desire to learn and be with the others, which is why he’s settled in very well. We were involved in some high-level friendlies against teams who were ahead of us in terms of their preparations, especially Nice, Valencia and Real Madrid. We had more of the ball in Trieste, but I think that Olivier can play well in various situations.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**CONTINUITY AND NEW ASPECTS**  
*""In terms of playing principles, we have continuity, and this is something that we need to exploit. However, in the modern game, you can’t only have one way of playing. Last year, we experimented with different types of movements, but our objective is to get the most out of the characteristics of the players and try to win every game. We want to play fast, intense football that involves many players getting on the ball. It’s something that requires a lot of effort and great team spirit. In this sense, we’ve been on an important journey, and we want to carry on performing at high levels.""*

**GROUP IDENTITY**  
*""AC Milan needs to be its own master and always there in the game, including during the most difficult matches. We need to have our own identity and be aware of our qualities. We possess a playing identity that allows us to make the most of our characteristics. We’ve made great strides forward, we’re even more of a team than before and want to display this out on the pitch. We fully believe in our work, which consists of passion, enthusiasm and ideas. This allowed us to overcome difficult moments last year, and it should help us this season as well. The captain? It’s Alessio (Romagnoli), this has never been in question. In a team, it’s very important to have responsible players who are united, enthusiastic and have the desire to do well. This is why I have a lot of confidence in them.""*

**TRANSFER MARKET**  
*""We’re not looking for players who are similar to those who left; we want to improve the team. The Club is there and will be ready if an opportunity arises. We already have high-quality players in attack, and they will be able to provide options against teams that sit back, which is something we were missing at times last year.""*

**NEW SERIE A SEASON**  
*""I think there are seven teams that can win the Scudetto. I think that it’ll be even more balanced than last season, when Inter broke away after previously going out in the Champions League in December. The team that emerged victorious is always the favourite, but, just like our rivals, we’re also strong. It’s a complicated league for everyone, and playing against these six teams will be difficult. The fixtures against the other sides will thus be even more important, and we’ll have to show that we’re ready tomorrow.""*",ACMilan,"Stefano Pioli's press conference, Sampdoria v AC Milan |""""WE ARE STRONGER""",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/p9cyqv/stefano_piolis_press_conference_sampdoria_v_ac/,2021-08-22 22:00:49

2) Yacine Adli is an open option for Milan **EVEN IF** Bakayoko arrives, but Milan will not spend the money that Bordoux asks. He is considered **AS A 5TH CHOICE MIDFIELDER** so Milan don't want to overspend or go above their evaluations. 

3) There were multiple players offered to Milan for the number 10 role, **WHICH I CAN ASSURE THE FANS THAT WILL COME, the attacking midfielder will be someone who can cover both the RW and the attacking midfield.** Isco was an option for Milan, which has gone quiet lately, because of certain economical requests(from either Real or him himself, from what I understood from the video). **THE ATTACKING MIDFIELDER WILL ARRIVE BETWEEN MID-NEXT WEEK TILL 2/3 DAYS BEFORE THE TRANSFER WINDOW IS CLOSED (basically will be a done deal till next Sunday it seems).**

PS: From his body language and reading between the lines, i could say that nobody knows shit when it comes to our number 10. Pretty much people are throwing names around and people close to our management are saying ""yes he was an option"" or ""no he was never an option"".

**Time:** 18:30 CET

**Venue:** 

Milan will take on Panathinaikos in their final friendly clash in less than an hour and Stefano Pioli has named his starting XI for the game. Compared to the last outing, there are a few changes for the Rossoneri. 

In defence, Simon Kjaer is back from start at the expense of Alessio Romagnoli, reuniting with Fikayo Tomori in the heart of the backline. Further up the pitch, Rade Krunic starts instead of Ismael Bennacer, who isn’t 100% yet.

Instead of a 4-2-3-1, this will be more like a 4-4-2 as Ante Rebic will start alongside Olivier Giroud up front. Alexis Saelemaekers and Rafael Leao will be the wingers, with Pioli hoping that this change can fuel the goalscoring.

Official Milan XI (4-4-2): Maignan; Calabria (Captain), Kjaer Tomori, Theo; Saelemaekers, Krunic, Tonali, Leao; Giroud, Rebic.

I watched some Bordeaux games and since I'm french I assume I tend to watch more Ligue 1 games than the sub does, so I thought it was worth sharing. Besides, and that's the bulk of the post, I spent some time browsing websites of Girondins fans.

A couple of things first, he's french-algerian (like me actually, but I'll try to keep my bias aside) and played/is playing for the french youth team. Could he play for Algeria ? Well technically yes he could very easily (even if he doesn't have the nationality right now, since his dad is born in Algeria); but I kind of doubt he would. I don't see Algeria needing him and I feel like that's something Maldini is mindful of anyway. 

About Bordeaux fans, keep in mind that it's a very pationate fanbase which is going through really tough times. Back in my younger days, Bordeaux was one of the strongest teams in Ligue 1, countless big names went there, the ones that'd ring a bell would be Zidane and to us, Gourcuff. I mean even Deschamps played for Bordeaux at some point. Nowadays they're in a financial nightmare. I won't go into details but Ligue 1 clubs have it rough due to some TV rights dramas. Bordeaux was owned only recently by an american fund (hmmm) which decided to pull out after seeing how much the revenues were going down. It's now owned by Gerard Lopez after being ownerless for a period.

So what I got about Adli from browsing their forums :

\- They are very conflicted about him, some like him and think he's got talent, some think he's nothing special and won't mind selling the guy

\- They often insist on his defensive/positioning mistakes. He's got a more than decent workrate it seems, but he feels lazy or not concerned enough by the tracking/pressing.

\- They say he's slow, even though he's a good dribbler. Definitely something all can agree on.

\- Adli is however, a player that looks forward when passing, they note that while most of the team is often doing safe backward passes, Adli is more often than not looking to make a pass forward; sometimes trying hard passes that miss, taking risks or trying things ""too hard"" for him. Very wasteful.

\- There was big expectations coming from their fanbase. You have to realise they paid him 5,5M even though he was barely 18, coming from PSG. With 40% on resale! That was a big investment for Adli. They often say that Adli is a good and talented young player that a lot of people expect too much from. If it wasn't for the relative hype, the comparison with Rabiot or even Zidane, they wouldn't be so critical.

\- Also, he's a vocal player who did some declarations post-game in the medias. At some point Bordeaux lost 10 games out of 12, and in the midst of this Adli declared that they were all together focused on avoiding the relegation (I won't translate word for word because the quote is a reference to a french TV show). Some fans said there was a difference between his attitude there, and his attitude on the pitch. Some fans really liked the fact that he went out there to defend his teamates and taking his responsabilities in tough times.

\- Very conflicted on his ""best"" position. Clearly Bordeaux isn't gifted with only amazing players and their midfield is in shambles. Adli has been tried at a lot of roles to patch holes and never felt truly comfortable at one position (keep in mind that he became a starter thanks to an injury). They definitely don't find him aggressive/physical enough to play box to box (even though they had to play him there for a bit). However some of his best games were in a double-pivot. Fans wish he'd be the attacking player they were hoping for, but it seems like he does not deliver there (ie: wings or AM). Since he loses balls they don't want him too deep, but they don't like him in an attacking role either because he becomes absent. All in all, they don't like him as 10, he needs to be in central midfield. 

\- Quite unconsistent, even his biggest haters can admit that he's got bright moments and games where he really shined, especially coming out of the bench. There's other games though where he's either invisible or fails everything he attempts.

\- Bordeaux isn't a club where you want to send a young player to grow. No debate. They easily admit that among their players, Adli is the main one that could be worth buying for another club.

\- He is a good shooter.

\_\_\_

Personally (tl;dr):

I think it's an interesting player, that could turn into a very decent one. He's young and I trust Milan environment to do good things on his mental. Bordeaux is honestly a terrible place for a young player to develop (very toxic). Now I admit I personally don't think he's got what it takes at this time to really get a starting spot. I assume he's supposed to be the back-up for Diaz (not feeling very confident on this one I'll be honest) with the added bonus of being able to play on a wing (even though I assume that's where Florenzi comes in) or instead of one of our defensive midfields... I feel like the way Bordeaux has been moving him around the pitch did not help him to really build his game and get confident.

15M feels like a lot though, honestly 10M, at most 12 felt more ""right"". I think he has a good mentality, despite the frustration that some Bordeaux fans can feel about him (he carries a lot of expectations). He has moments of brilliance, and that's the main takeaway for me, I hope we can develop him into a player that shows more of these moments of brilliance and less of wastefulness.

*Note: Altafini is known in Brazil as Mazzola, due to his resemblance with Valentino Mazzola. So, never mind the different name.*

**Question 1** (+32 votes)

Altafini, before anything, I'd like to thank you in the first place for your importance in Palmeiras' and Milan's history. To my father – a milanese born in Milan – you are the biggest striker in the *Rossoneri's* history. Secondly, I thank you for your participation in this AMA.

I'd like to know how it was for you the 1963 European Cup final, in which Milan defeated Benfica with you scoring a brace, thus kicking off Milan's titles history on the biggest European club competition. When did you realize what you had done?

**Altafini:** You should first know that there is a coincidence. In 1958, Brazil came to Sweden, for the World Cup. And as we passed by Florence and Milan, we played two friendlies. And there was the European Cup final between Milan and Real Madrid – which Milan lost by 2-3. So this was the first contact I had with the European Cup.

Later on, when I moved to Italy, naturally, Milan won the Serie A and was able to play in the European Cup twice. So in 1961/62, Milan was placed 7 in the League, but we were doing fine in the European Cup. In every match we played we were moving forward, until the final against Benfica.

And Benfica was the current champion, having beaten Real Madrid the year before. Benfica was the Portuguese National Team, mostly the attack and some defense players. We were losing 0-1, on the first half. So I tied the game and then scored the 2-1 for us.

It was a huge thing for me, because until today they talk about it. And until today they still repeat these same movies from before.

Today, we from Brazil, are the Olympic champions. It was a very beautiful feat, etc. But my admiration wasn't for Brazil, because I'm used to Brazil being a winner. My admiration is for Daniel Alves. No one on earth will beat his record, he has 45 trophies. I'm proud of him.

**Question 2** (+30 votes)

Besides facing Pelé's Santos in the Intercontinental Cup final in 1963, you also played some friendlies against them in matches that are considered today as “non-official”. Anachronistically, it became common to despise the goals scored by Pelé in those friendlies and extinct tournaments – absurdly, it's even denied that the King has scored more than one thousand goals. How did you and your Milan teammates view those matches? Was there a real desire to win or did they treat it as mere exhibition matches?

**Altafini:** In the time that I played in Italy, friendlies meant nothing. We did an excursion in South America once, and so I understood what was a friendly: the argentine didn't want to lose, the uruguayan didn't want to lose, no one, from Bolivia, from Venezuela, no one wanted to lose a friendly. And in Italy it counted very little.

The Coppa Italia also counted very little. It got more importance, more value, after a few years, because they learnt from the English Cup, the FA Cup, which was very important. Then the italians started to give more importance to it.

---

**Question 3** (+23 votes)

What were the biggest differences between the Brazilian League and Serie A when he joined Milan? Was one league stronger at that time? Most other Brazilian legends of that era (Pelé, Garrincha, Capita, Jairzinho, etc.) stayed in Brazil, so what motivated him to leave for Italy?

**Altafini:** Here in Italy there was a football system, around 1958, that didn't care much about practicing. They only cared about the Thursday practice, when we used to play “starters against reserves”. 

So there was an attitude completely against football. We, as players, knew that the ball is very important to the player: you need to practice ball control, etc. 

But not in Italy, what they used to say was that all you need is to arrive on the matchday with guts and that's all. So I had a really hard time with this, but with the arrival of Heri Herrera, it got better, and other coaches started to copy him.

If you look at today's ball control, passes, they practice it for hours and hours – it wasn't like this in my time. There were players that it looked like as if they were fighting with the ball.

**Question 4** (+21 votes)

Good night, honored to ask you a few questions, living legend of football. Close to complete 24 years of age, you played in the 1962 World Cup for Italy, and, in a weird way, stopped being called after that. In full swing, one of the best football forwards, didn't play for the National Team no more; why do you think that happened?

**Note:** He sort of talked about this on question no. 7, so I didn't ask him this specific question directly to avoid repetition.

**Question 5** (+21 votes)

You who already traveled the world in the best pizzerias, is ketchup on pizza an acceptable sauce?
Alternative question: my brother and I eat pizza with ketchup and mustard, would we be in danger if we traveled to Italy?

**Altafini:** No, the pizza must be neapolitan. In Brazil they make pizza with pear, with apple, it's nothing like this. Pizza must be neapolitan. But you make pizza the way you like, you can even add marmalade, but that's not the way.. (laughs)

---

**Question 6** (+15 votes)

Good night, Mazzola.

Firstly, thank you for everything you have done for Palmeiras, you almost scored 100 goals for our club. We are forever grateful for this. It's a pity you didn't win titles.

Well, I'd like to know how did it feel to play in that 1958 World Cup with that amazing brazilian team of giants, and I'd like also to hear one of your stories with Pelé. It must have been gratifying for you to share the locker room with our king of football.

Long live, Mazzola!

**Altafini:** Look.. We left Brazil, I remember it well, quite discredited. And when we played our last match with the Brazilian National Team against Corinthians, at the Pacaembu – which was our friendly farewell from Brazil to Europe –, I remember when Brazil was booed when entering the pitch. We were being booed! And when Corinthians entered the pitch, they looked like the Brazilian National Team: fireworkers, firecrackers, and all those things. And I was quite impressed with this. Hopefully, we won this practice match, by 5-1.

We left Brazil knowing one thing: that me and Pelé were the starters. I was the number 9 and he was the 10. And when we left Brazil, we arrived in Italy to play two friendlies. Pelé had some knee pain and couldn't play. So Vavá played as a striker. And what happened: a lot of people said later on that I had lost the position to Pelé. Which is not true, I lost the position to Vavá.

Pelé was 17 years old, and I was 19. But 17 year old Pelé was older than me, mentally. He thought more about football than I did, and I thought more about everything.

But the decision to put Vavá in my place was fair, because Vavá was 24 years old, and I was 19. He was most powerful technically, physically, and he was dazzling when playing with Brazil's attack. 

So it's crystal clear that between Pelé and myself, there was never a rivalry, we were friends, as we still are. The only thing that happened was that they made a movie about Pelé's life, and made me look like as if I was his enemy. They said that when we played together when we were kids, that I was rich, that his mother worked at my place as a maid, that I was rich and him poor. That hurt me a lot! 

After all, Pelé and I met when we were called for the Brazil National Team at the age of 17. And since kids, we neve played together. I was very hurt with this, after all we were two youngsters, two guys, his mother would tell us before leaving to Europe to stay together, to be careful. There wasn't anything like that. 

Pelé, to me, is the best player in the world, this saying that he didn't score 1000 goals, who invented this? No one should be saying that Ronaldo broke all the records, isn't it true?

**Question 7** (+15 votes)

Good night, Mazzola. Something about your career as a player that always stroke my attention is the fact of having played two consecutive World Cups for different countries. How was it for you to play one World Cup for your birth country and then, in the following event, defend the colors of the country that welcomed you?

**Altafini:** Well, so, there's a very logical explanation here, that not many people know of. When we played against Fiorentina, when going to Sweden, in what was Julinho Botelho's – the best right-wing in Brazil, because Garrincha hadn't rose to stardom yet, so much that it was Joel who started in the World Cup – farewell from Fiorentina.. Well, Julinho wasn't called to the Brazilian National Team in 1958 because he played in Europe. There was some sort of law, of statute, that every brazilian player that played in Europe couldn't play for the Brazilian National Team. It wasn't even that it wasn't allowed, one would just not be called.

Then what happened: after a couple years, more of less in 1958, my uncle – who took care of my business and was in Brazil – went to the CBD (Brazililian FA) and asked if I would be called or not. They said that I wouldn't be called, for not playing in Brazil. So I, at the age of 23-24 years, had my World Cup story ending right there.

So, I had my Italian passport, they called me and I played for the Italian National Team.

But then what happened? There was a journalist in São Paulo, from the *Diário Popular* – I don't remember his name anymore –, that massacred me the entire year. “Ex-brazilian”, “mercenary”, he massacred me. And I would like that this person – I don't know if he's alive or not –, if he's alive, I would like him to look at all the brazilian players today that play in all these European National Teams. In the National Team, Tolói was european champion, the left-back too, and I was massacred, which was an enormous injustice.

But then what happened? It happened something worse: after I played for Italy in 1962, FIFA created a rule that no player would be allowed to switch between national teams no more. So my career was finished there.

So I tell you the following: me, world champion in 1958, would be called – playing or not – to 1962, because almost all the 1958 players were called. Besides, Pelé was 17 and I was 19, the youngers of the National Team. I would be called to the World Cup in Chile and also in 1970. Because in 1970, I was still at the age of 30 and a few years old.

**Question 8** (+12 votes)

Great, great Mazzola! Immense honor to have you here with us!

Question: When following today's football, what do you look and think “*in my time, I would never be able to do this*” and, in the same spirit, recall and think “*today, they would never be able to do that*”?

**Altafini:** Look, two things.

Let's talk about technology: the ball weighs less. The pitches, we played on snow, dust, mud, ice on the pitch. Today, you don't have these kind of things anymore. So what happens: the ball today is lighter. The kit, shirt, shorts, boots, gee.. The boots weigh half a kilo less. Really light.

Then, the food. There wasn't much regularity. You think that when we played, 3 or 4 hours before the match, we would lunch pasta or rice, and a steak. I mean, you'll enter the pitch in 3 hours, caring all this weight in your body. Today, feeding increased a lot, medicine increased a lot, there's a lot more medicine for everything. In that time, if a player went through a knee surgery, he would be under the risk of not playing again. But today, after 20-25 days, he's already able to play.

One more thing that I'll talk about: technically, the game changed a lot. At our time we were a lot less fast than today. Actually, it was the same speed as of today, but the game was slower. Today there's a lot more action, the ball runs more, there's a lot of technique when the player is well set. In this sense, the game increased a lot.

I'll tell you one more thing: the man-to-man marking. If you watched 1982 Brazil, it's the marking that Gentil did against Zico and against Maradona: narrow. Not today. Today if you have the bell and are moving towards the goal, nobody can knock you down, otherwise he'll be directly sent away. 

I mean, a player knows today how much he can be trained and how much he can't be trained. The only thing that they are slaughtering is the tactics.

**Question 9** (+12 votes)

You were part of a generation that grew up with a very alive *Maracanazzo* sorrow, and, when you arrived at Milan, one of your teammates was Schiaffino, one of the main players of that 1950 Uruguay. How was your relation with him, did he mention something about that match with you?

**Altafino:** We didn't talk about it, because he is a very serious person. He helped me a lot, technically. I learnt a lot from him, but the nicest thing of all, was that one who scored the Sweden goal against Brazil, Liedholm, it was him who took me by the arms, by the hands and took me, taught me a lot of stuff.

There wasn't any rivalry, mocking, nothing. These are the real champions. I learnt a lot when I was young, I'll tell you a very interesting episode from when I played at Palmeiras. Well, I, in 1950, was young. And our 1950 idols were Barbosa, Augusto, Juvenal, Bauer, Danilo and Bigode, Friaça, Zizinho, Jair, Ademir e Chico. Who also were Pelé's idols aswell.

So what happened: in 1957, more or less a year before the World Cup, Zizinho (Note: 1950 World Cup Golden Ball) – who was my idol, who was “the Pelé” of that time – played for São Paulo and was 38, if I'm not mistaken. So the following happened: Palmeiras and São Paulo were playing at the Pacaembu, and he knocked me over. He knocked me over, picked me by the hands and said: “Sorry, kid. I had to knock you over”. I got goosebumps, like, my own idol apologizing to me?

That was a teaching, that you can read 20 books and won't learn. And I learnt that vanity doesn't exist, what exists is a simplicity of being a player. He was a fantastic player. And I had the luck to play with many of these players, and I learnt. I told you about Schiaffino, about Liedholm, but I'm someone who, if a youngster tells me something interesting, I learn from him. It's not true that if an advice was good, you would pay for it. Zizinho's humility taught me a lot of things. 

And another thing: when I practiced with the *Seleção*, when I was a kid, at the age of 19, there were players who'd run around the pitch and lead the queue. They were the *Seleção* best players, I learnt from this too.

**Question 10** (+11 votes)

Did you use to swap shirts with the adversaries? If you did, which ones do you keep with more affection?

**Altafini:** No, no. At the final in Wembley, in 1963, a fan entered the pitch, took my shirt and left. You know, Pelé's 1970 shirt was sold for 500k USD. A relic. And it was an Italian player who swapped shirts with him.

**Question 11** (+11 votes)

How was it to play the World Cup for Italy? Did you suffer any prejudice for being brazilian or were you always well received by your teammates?

**Altafini:** No, no, no. Besides, there were four of us: me, Sormani – who played with Pelé at Santos –, Sivori and Maschio, who were argentine. But I found a huge disorganization in the Italian National Team, we didn't have a coach. Besides, who fielded the team were two journalists with the two responsibles for the National Team. It was a pity, because the Italian National Team – and I'll tell you something you won't believe –, after Brazil, was the best National Team in that World Cup.

And furthermore, the following happened: some journalists were bad-mouthing about Chile, in the 1962 World Cup, and the country revolted against us. I mean, they massacred me at the training camp, they would come and throw rocks, fight, always against brazilians. Because the journalist said that there were only vagabonds in the country, only prostitutes, so it touched the chileans' pride, and the chileans were right.

Good night, Mazzola! Firstly, thank you for all that you have done for our shirt and thanks for participating in this AMA.

Who was your best team teammate during your time in Palmeiras?

**Altafini:** It's not that I “had a teammate”, I admired one of the best players, who is a role model to the *palmeirense* and brazilian football, Waldemar Fiume. I think there's a statue of him at the stadium. But, afterwards, I admired a lot more other players, like Ademir da Guia, Chinesinho, Julinho, Djalma Santos..

You know, when Palmeiras sold me to Milan, they bought 22 players in 1958/59, built the stadium and also the gymnasium with the money. I mean, I collaborated somehow to Palmeiras 1959 State League title, because they bought Djalma Santos, Julinho, Ênio Andrade, Chinesinho, the goalkeeper Valdir. I mean, they bought half of the *Gaúcho* (i.e.: from Rio Grande do Sul) State League Team and won the *Paulista* (i.e.: from São Paulo) State League title against Santos in 1959. And I collaborated with my departure, I mean, I did something good for Palmeiras.

**Question 13** (+9 votes)

Altafini, what is the feeling of being and idol of two of the biggest clubs in the world: Palmeiras and Milan? Hugs

**Altafini:** I feel very honored. I have a thing when I'm with friends, that they already know: nobody talks about me. Because I don't like when they talk about me. For example, “oh do you remember that match you played?”, “do you remember that play?”. I don't want to know, I don't want to know about me. Talk about everything, but not about me.

So I mean, I'm very proud of having all of this, when people recognize me, it's all good. But if they start talking about me, change the subject.

I like to be, let's say, “hidden”. Besides, even with these masks I've been wearing, people still recognize me, it's the same thing and I get crazy “damn, even like this!” (laughs).

Altafini, which was the toughest team you faced, Eusébio's Benfica or Pelé's Santos?

**Question 15** (+7 votes)

Two years before the World Cup in Brazil, you criticized the playing style of that *Seleção* (which was still coached by Dunga), from how Neymar positioned himself to the “tactical rigidity” of the players, specially when comparing to the fundamental characteristics for the 1958 World Cup victory. Today, how do you view our National Team? Besides that, having followed the historical progress of our National Team , do you agree with the supporters who say we lost the brazilian football DNA?

**Altafini:** I think that.. I don't know. I admire Tite a lot, he's a great coach. I don't know if he follows the players in Brazil, or even those who are in Europe and in the rest of the world. Because that are some players, that it's not possible, they are called by the Italian National Team, by every sort of National Team in Europe, but not by Tite.

There are some players here, Jorginho for example, who is brazilian and was never called to the Brazilian National Team. Champion of Europe with Chelsea, champion with Italy in the Euro, it's full of brazilians around here. I don't know in which way Brazil follow these players. I think that's a great loss.

**Question 16** (+6 votes)

Hi Mazzola, could you say what is your perception of the football practiced in the 1950s and in the 1970s? Did you, as a player, feel that the game changed, somehow?

**Altafini:** I liked our football more because it was slow, thoughtful. Even then, there are players in modern football – which is very fast –, a lot of great players, that demonstrate. Messi, for me – I'm brazilian and I say this –, is, today, the best player in the world. It could be Neymar, but Neymar, I don't know if he took his career seriously. And there are players who are big, like Cruyff. I don't make parallel between any players. Pelé was the greatest and the rest comes after him.

---

**Question 17** (+6 votes)

Wow, very legendary being able to ask you a question! I hope everything's fine over there!

Well, I don't really know what to ask, but I've read here that you've been with Pelé in 1958 and that both of you were very young, could you tell me about Pelé's personality at that time, was he a “kiddo” like Neymar, or more of a “sheriff”? How was he in the locker room?

And if I may ask you another question, was the locker room ambient between you full of jokes and fun, or was it more serious?

Big hug!

**Altafini:** Pelé was a simple person, normal. Besides me admiring him for his football, I admired him as a supporter. There were 200 people asking for autographs, he signed it slowly, with no mourning, no brawling, no complaining. My admiration for him is because of that. I mean, the big actor must be like this. I learnt that in the United States the big basketball, baseball players, and all, they dedicate one weekday to teach the school boys, which is something very beautiful.

Pelé can't go anywhere because, clearly, everyone goes to him. I didn't like being like this, I'm very happy with what I am. I enter a bar, a restaurant, chill. But I'll tell you, it happens sometimes when I stop on the road, to have coffee, and someone yells “He is here, the Altafini, the Mazzola!” (laughs).

Do you know what happens a lot here? I'll tell you, you won't believe. I make 20 to 30 photographs a day. It happens a lot to me, that I enter a bar, a *café*, people pick their smartphones and say: “Let me call home, come speak to my dad, to my grandfather, to my brother!”. And I don't know what to say (laughs). People ask me to give birthdays greetings, marriage greetings, it's a lot.

But I'm very happy with what I do. The only thing that disappoints me is Palmeiras. You don't know what I do, but I'll tell you: I administrate *Italgreen* of Brazil – we make synthetic grass fields, we did at the Pinheiros, at the Bradesco, at Santos, Athletico Paranaense, we made 120 pitches in Brazil and we'll make 14 pitches for the CBF (Brazilian FA). I mean, the only displeasure that I had is with Palmeiras, that gave their pitch to a dutch organization. It disappointed me, because I couldn't do my own team's pitch, but did all the others.

**Question 18** (+5 votes)

Mazzola, thank you very much for answering our questions, I have a profound admiration for what you have done in football. Which were the best teams that you faced?

**Altafini:** Ajax was the best. I admired a lot of what they did tactically. And then Real Madrid too, Barcelona – I played against Evaristo. Here in Italy, Inter and Juventus.

**Question 19** (+4 votes)

How was it like to play in the European football coming from abroad at a time that moving from South America to Europe wasn't common at all? How was the communication during practices and matches? Was there any resistance against foreigners in the team, even if they had italian origins?

**Note:** He sort of talked about this on questions no. 3 and 11, so I didn't ask him this specific question directly to avoid repetition.

---

**Question 20** (+4 votes)

How is it like to carry so much fame?

**Altafini:** I am lucky for having so much disposition with fans, with people. When I had my birthday last Saturday (July 24th), I watched on television a lot of people – personalities, players, coaches – sending me their greetings. I'm very proud of this.

When they ask which team I support, I'm almost scared to say. Because I'll be dealing with the person's sensibility. I say I support all teams – but the truth is that I support Milan (laughs). It's the only team with which I have a relation, they always invite me, parties, everything, I have a seated place in the stadium. With Palmeiras too, they are the only two teams which I'm connected with. That, for me, is a huge satisfaction.

Do you know what upsets me? A player that, when leaving the team, says that he's lacking recognition – damn, they pay you a lot of money, you played there for years, and you have no recognition? *Che hai avuto, avuto, avuto. Che hai dato, hai dato, hai dato* (Note: he spoke Italian in these last two sentences, so I think I got it wrong, he said he meant “*What you had, you had, you had. What you gave, you gave, you gave*”).

In the 1958 World Cup, Feola kept switching between you and Vavá. Couldn't he insist more in playing both of you? How do you see this?

**Question 22** (+3 votes)

What's your opinion about the European Superleague?

**Altafini:** When I was 20 (in 1958), you heard a lot of people saying “oh, football is ending, it can't keep this way, money will kill the game”. When I was 30, I heard the same thing: “hey, football is ending”. At forty, the same thing, fifty, sixty, seventy, and I'm eighty now. So, I guess football got worse (laughs).

It's all a matter of money. They want to make this Superleague despite the small clubs. It's not fair to do this.

Yesterday (August 7th) in Madrid, Pérez met with the Barcelona and the Juventus' president, so they're still working on it.

---

**Question 23** (+3 votes)

You, besides being more technical and skilled than the great Vavá, scored a brace in Brazil's first World Cup match in 1958. Despite that, you lost your spot among the starters. Did you feel wronged? Did Vicente Feola explain to you the reason of the change?

**Altafini:** It was the following: the first match, against Austria, I scored a brace. But the pitch, it was a potato pitch. That's why I also told you that football today is an entire different thing. And it happened that I twisted my ankle. And in the second match, against England, I played with my ankle bandaged. So much that I picked the ball, dribbled the advesary and ran towards the goal. And I was going to dribble the goalkeeper, but I ended up leaving the pitch with the ball because I couldn't stop to make a turn with my ankle.

So what happened: Vavá took my place against Russia and hurt himself. So I entered against Wales – I scored a bicycle goal from the outside of the area and the referee didn't concede the goal. He was 5 meters away from the adversary, and they still ask me about it to this day. But I was part of Pelé's goal, because I touched the ball before him.

Then I lost my spot to Vavá, but I was really glad, because Vavá was a lot more experienced and at ease than me. Thanks God.

**Question 24** (+3 votes)

Hi, Mazzola, all good?

You played for Palmeiras not much after the team dominated the *paulista* (i.e.: from São Paulo) football scene with São Paulo FC through all of the 1940s. Given this history, was there more rivalry with São Paulo or with Santos, who were winning everything at that time?

(I excluded Corinthians for believing they have always been the biggest rivals, but in case the rivalry with the other teams was bigger, please let me know!)

**Altafini:** I think that.. like my *palmeirenses* friends say, the real rivalry was with São Paulo. Only in 1959, 1958, more or less, that Santos was a big rival – at that time, there was a lot of rivalry, mainly because in 1959 Palmeiras beat Santos in the *Campeonato Paulista* (i.e.: São Paulo State League), with Pelé and all.

I'll tell you something: I'm honored to say I'm a *palmeirense*. Palmeiras was the only team, I think, in the world, that represented the Brazilian National Team well. They beat Uruguay 3-0.

**Question 25** (+3 votes)

Mazzola, it's an honor for us in this community to have you answering our questions. We thank you beforehand for accepting this invitation!

I'd like to know how was the process of changing from National Team at that time, between the 1950s and 1960s, when you won the 1958 World Cup, in Sweden, and in 1962 played in the World Cup with Italy. The naturalization process was very different from today's?

Hi, Mazzola. It's a very big honor having you here and I hope you'll feel welcomed by the reddit community.

You were part of the first World Cup title campaign for Brazil, in 1958. It was 8 years after the 1950 World Cup trauma, which happened after the fateful defeat to Uruguay known as *Maracanazzo*. Did the shock of that tournament in our own country influence in the backstages of the team that you were part of, like a pressure or distrust? And was that useful, somehow, as a motivation for you to get the world title that you ended up winning?

**Question 27** (+3 votes)

Hello Mazzola. How were the trainings, tactics and acquaintanceship with Nereo Rocco? And how was it to face Cruyff's Ajax?

**Altafini:** Rocco, he practiced the team, he used the *verrou* strategy, at Padova. He used to say the following: in my team there must be a goalkeeper, a central, a midfielder and a center-forward. And there wasn't any game for him, it was all like “ball go forward”. He was a fantastic man, because he would yell at you, scold, and after 5 minutes he'd hug you. He was a diplomat and he didn't know. A very generous person, a normal person, very natural, genuine.

He arrived at the pitch many times, and saw the players kind of down, and said: “Oh, I get it. You don't want to practice, right? Let's have a walk in the park”. He understood this very well, he was a fantastic person. He was very friend with the most important italian football journalist, called Gianni Brera, and every monday they'd have dinner at Brera's house. And there was him, the TV announcer – Nicolò Carosio – and Brera. They'd soak themselves in wine and the following day were fine. He himself would tell it, it was amazing.

The Ajax, we arrived at the final, and truth is, they were the best team in Europe at that moment. I had never seen a team playing with such synchrony. They could win when they wanted – even though we had a few goal occasions. They had that rotation in the team – like in volleyball before – that when the nine advanced, the central picked the nine's spot, the left-back came to the central's spot and the left-wing picked the left-back place. So a lot of times I was being marked by Cruyff. They had this rotation that no one could make until today.

I have a satisfaction from many years ago, when Pelé was about to go to Cosmos, around 1968, 1969 (Note: it was in 1975). It was Van Himst's – from Belgium – farewell, and they invited me to this Rest of the World vs. Anderlecht match (Note: it was on the March 26th 1975). And the attack, I'll tell you how it was. I'll tell you who was the “white fly” there, right? Amancio, Eusébio, White Fly, Pelé and Cruyff. The “white fly” was me (laughs). What was I doing there? I played with them, but the result didn't matter, the match, what's important is that we had this team photo together.

**Question 28** (+3 votes)

Hello, Mazzola. A lot of stadiums are beginning to receive supporters again. I'd like to know about your time, how did the supoprters influence the match in the 1950s and 1960s when there weren't ultras and the stadiums were sometimes overcrowded? Were there songs, bands and these sort of things?

**Altafini:** The problem today is that the supporters are part of the club. Here in Italy they even go on strike, go protest in front of the headquarter, on the football pitch. I mean, there wasn't any of this before. There was a player who had played for Inter and the Juventus' fans didn't want him, they began to protest.

A lot of times I see these San Siro stadium photographs, overcrowded, with 60, 70, 80 thousand people, all wearing ties and hats. It was something else.

**Question 29** (+3 votes) 

Dear Mazzola, it's an immense honor having you, a brazilian and italian football legend, in this forum! In your opinion, who are the 3 best football players of all time?

**Altafini:** The best of all time? I think Pelé, Maradona.. and then I leave the third place vacant. Because there are a lot of football players in Brazil that I admire so much: Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Ademir da Guia who isn't very known in Europe. Neymar too. I'll leave this spot open.

---

**Question 30** (+3 votes)

Altafini, what do you think that lacks (besides money) to football clubs from Italy to retake the titles path in Europe?

**Altafini:** The problem is that Juventus can't win, right? It looks like there's a curse, they get there and can't win. The last one was Inter, and before them, Milan.

In any case, do you know what happens? Many times it all depends on one match. For example, I used to comment a lot that Belgium were favorites in the Euro. They failed spectacularly. One can't have faith in a team anymore, when you say they're favorites, they don't win.

Paris Saint-Germain, which it seems Messi will be joining, they have the best team in the world. But haven't won anything yet. The coach left to Chelsea, Silva too, they won the European Cup. It's no use saying who will win because, then, they don't.

Good night, Mazzola, it's a great honor being able to speak with a football legend. 

I read some articles saying that political matters prevented you of wearing the *amarelinha* (i.e.: the “little yellow shirt”, Brazil's kit) again in 1962. Could you, if possible, give us more detail about it? And, if you allow me, how did the opportunity of playing the World Cup for Italy emerged?

Good night Mazzola.

You arrived at Milan in 1958 right after the World Cup, and became teammate with Liedholm, the main name of the Swedish National Team that you played against in the 1958 World Cup final. How were you received by him at Milan? Was there any sort of resentment from him due to their defeat at the World Cup or was he receptive?

**Altafini:** It was him who welcomed me the best at Milan. Besides being my teammate, he was also my coach afterwards. And he taught me a lot of things, like passing. I think that if a player won't accept any advice, it's better that he quits.

**Question 34** (+1 vote)

Altafini, a little controversial question (I'll get it if you won't answer): please, comment about the refereeing in the 1963 Intercontinental Cup, when Milan lost to Santos. I've read and heard many stories that the refereeing favored the brazilians..

**Altafini:** Look.. When they sent the referees' list to Milan, Dino Sani and I told the president: accept anything, even a brazilian, but not Juan Brozzi, the argentine. These dumb Milan directors accepted as soon as they could Juan Brozzi. That was the end for us, because everything happened. Inside the tunnel, when we were still entering the pitch, Ismael headbutted Amarildo in the chest, they did all sort of things.

Do you know what happened, the worst thing that happened on that match? That Pelé wasn't there. If Pelé had played, this wouldn't have happened. And another thing that happened, we were winning it 2-0 in the first half, a tremendous rain fell and soaked the Maracanã. In the second half, Milan couldn't play forward no more, and Santos cornered us there and won.

But then the third match was a shame, because the referee was shameless. He gave a penalty.. Not even if we had 3 goalkeepers, and we still used the reserve, because our started got injured too. A lot of brazilian journalists told me to my face, on television, that it was a robbery. And it really was, it was a robbery.

About the controversial 1951 Club World Cup, what is your point of view?

What is your “dream team”? It can be any player, provided that they have played for *Palestra* (i.e. Palmeiras).

HommoFroggy,1628467677.0,p0q59h,52.0,1.0,"From my perspective the Serie A preparation, pre-season friendlies were completed with the Valencia game. The Real Madrid game is a different sphere of preparations, which creates an indication towards the UCL not Serie A. Surely we didn't play against the best Real Madrid of the last 20 years but it was Real Madrid with a midfield of Casemiro and Modric nothing the less. For every Benzema missing from Real there is an Ibra missing in our ranks and for every Kross missing there is a Kessie or Bennacer. Also, to emphasize is the fact that the Spanish league starts next week for Real Madrid. I just watched Juventus get dismantled by Barcelona because they couldn't keep up athletically with Barca, to create more context. 


Okey i want to start with the defensive aspect because not much changes from how we play in Serie A and how we would play in UCL. Ofc not identically the same but much more similar than the offensive aspect of our game. To be noticed... **We have conceded 0 goals from open play in our 4 friendlies played so far, only one goal from the penalty**. Our defense from what ican tell looks very good. A solid foundation to build our team from. What cannot be divided in the way we defend is the midfielder involvment to close up spaces and the synchronisation between our pivots and our defense. What i want to emphasize again this match is a Romagnoli who seems quite confident and a Tonali who doesn't seem like a stranger player but part of the team in any shape or form. Tonali and Romagnoli in all the friendlies have been inside the game for the entirity of the game in one shape or the other. I feel very confident that this season we will build up from our last 5 Serie A games from last season and concede less than 30 goals. 


When it comes to the offense, i am sorry i don't see this Real game as an indicator for our Serie A campaign... maybe a little bit when we face some direct rivals **maybe**... because no one in our league has the quality in the midfield that Real had today. Modric with one pass from a bad position would create 30 meters of terrain advantage. Either way... the big difference in how we play in Serie A and in these kind of matches is that in Serie A our 3 attacking midfielders (LW-AM-RW) would play around our striker when we have someone alla Giroud or Ibra. In these kind of matches you need a striker that can play alongside your attacking midfielders, who can become a 4th attacking midfielder and also someone who can finalise. In Serie A playing off that striker that can bully players is very advantageous because you basically close the opposition in their own box. In UCL you have more 1v1 scenarios where your striker will play the ball and have to sprint to attack the box with more dynamism... i don't see Ibra or Giroud do that. Ofc matches differ from one and the other and we can attack the box with fullbacks and so on but still this remains a point to improve. Either way... **something quite important** to be noticed yet again this match is that our attacking players have started to play more centrally than wide. They compact the middle of the field way more than last year, something that we did vs Juventus for example to take them by surprise by playing both Calha and Diaz. Personally i like this because it gives more space to fullbacks and a surprise attack by wingers as we saw today when Leao went wild in that flank. 


I will not go player by player this time around but some  noticable things that i saw in this match considering our players: 


 - Calbria: except that one mistake at the pen and not finding his footing when it comes to crossing, way better game than the last one. 


  - Tonali: Was always inside the game especially defensively. At the penalty situation yes he lost his man but when he recovered Bale showed great experience to position himself well and disbalance him. Small things that i appreciate very very much. He interprets space way better now, knows where to get the ball... if you remember last season he alwys stayed in the middle of the pitch (frustrated me to the maximum), now he drops deep, moves off the ball and all the nice things. What i noticed in the match thread was the ""why is he trying so many hard passes"" i personally look at that as a positive thing. He has the vision and the technique to nail those passes, he needs to go through trial and error to get better at it and understanding that part of the game better. I see Tonali as a season changer next season, he surely looks motivated. 


 - Krunic: **KRUNIC IS A MEZALLA** He cannot play in a double pivot, he hasn't had a single good game there ffs. As a LW or AM rotation option that gives physicality, i rate the guy honestly i do.... as a CM, he transforms to the most useless player in the pitch. 


 - Alexis: After not so good performances in the last matches, this one was quite good honestly. Just in time before the season start. 


 - Leao: He was on, joy to watch honestly. Leao when is on he is that waw factor that can give numerical advantage and decide matches. Last season he build up from his first season even if it was a hard season for him due to Covid, playing out of position and so on... on top of his 6 goals he added also 6 assists. I expect and i strongly hope that as a just 22 year old now, he can reach double digits this season in Serie A while maintaining the above 5 assists in a season margin as well. A more consistent Leao can be a game changer and us having both Ibra and Giroud can influence this aspect of his game. 


  - Diaz: Suffered the Real Madrid midfield and especially Casemiro. Nobody and i repeat nobody is expecting the guy to be UCL material this season, that is why we NEED another number 10 and Maldini knows this. Saying this, doesn't mean that Brahim cannot grow during the season to surprise our expectations. He always shows glimpses of that and doesn't stop trying. 


 - Rebic: I swear to god if we get Second part of the season Rebic again this season i will go crazy... can he come good this one season from the fucking start? The guy reminds me of solar beam from Pokemon, charges for one round to deal massive damage the second round. Rebic we need you in both rounds my guy.... we don't need you to score 10+ goals only on the second part of the season... 


 - Balo Toure: I was suprised by him honestly... got into the game in such a good way and was very clean. 


Final thoughts: I know that people will say ""but we scored 1 goal in the last 3 friendlies and that from a freekick"" It is understandable but if we look at our process goal, the way we move the ball and towards what sides are we doing it... if we convert that output against Serie A teams which i remind you are far behind the teams we faced as far as athletical preparation goes, we will have a good start of the season. **ESPECIALLY adding Kessie and Benncer to the mix**.",ACMilan,[Summary + overall thoughts] Real Madrid vs AC Milan,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/p0q59h/summary_overall_thoughts_real_madrid_vs_ac_milan/,2021-08-09 08:07:57

I am tired of reading ""Pobega is good but tHe SyStEm"", ""Kalulu is good but as CB not as RB because tHe SyStEm"". 

I think it is manager's duty to find the best use for each player, to make some tactical changes in order to fit good players in, instead of playing shitty Krunic because he fits the system more. Like imagine swapping Messi for Crouch because your system revolves around crosses and you need someone tall. Change the system instead man. 

No top team is chasing Bakayoko and Kamara, no one needs them. No one is chasing #10 either. We are narrowing ourselves to few certain type players to fit Pioli system. If he underperforms and is fired, another manager will come and won't use these players and we'll have another summer drama of getting rid of players unwanted by anyone.

José Altafini -- known in Brazil as Mazzola -- joined the AC Milan squad in 1958, right after winning the World Cup with Brazil, in which he scored 2 goals in 3 matches. Altafini would stay at Milan for 7 seasons, scoring 161 goals in 246 matches -- which makes him the 4th highest topscorer of AC Milan's history.

For Milan, he won two Serie A titles (1958-59 and 1961-62) and one European Cup (1962-63). In the latter he notably scored 14 goals -- two of them in the final against Benfica at the Wembley --, which also made him the highest topscorer in a single European Cup/Champions League edition until 2014.

He also played for the Italian National Team in the 1962 World Cup in Chile, being thus one of the 6 players to play in different World Cups for different countries.

Due to time difference (5 hours difference between Brazilian and Italian time), we will be opening the thread tonight at 10pm (Brazilian time/BRT), which will be 3am in Italy/CEST. Our guest will arrive tomorrow (August 8th) at 3pm (Italian time/CEST) to answer them, so you'll have 12 hours (from 3am to 3pm in Italy/CEST) to drop your questions on the thread. However, our guest won't stay more than an hour with us, so not all questions will be answered. You can ask your questions in english. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

The AMA thread will be pinned at r/futebol. You can take a look at our announcement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/ozt6ci/an%C3%BAncio_de_ama_com_mazzola_%C3%ADdolo_de_palmeiras_e/).

I know a lot of us fans have been frustrated by the lackluster window so far. The team needs additions in vital positions on the field while also lacking effective subs in a thin and young squad.

It doesn’t help that we lost a generational player like Donnarumma for free. Whether we love him or hate him losing Hakan is a big loss as well as he is a vital part of our attacking play.


However, just seeing the financial mess our neighbors Inter are facing, forcing them to sell their best players. As well as the bombshell of Messi leaving Barcelona with the club recording huge losses, should put things into perspective for us fans.

The current management, lead by Gazidis and guided by Maldini, Massara ane Moncada. Have come in after almost a decade of mismanagement in the club. We were paying some of the highest wage bills in the league, recording losses year after year while not showing any footballing success.

The effort to correct that is a long term project, and even though it’s been 3 years since Elliot took over, there is still a lot of work to be done to steady the ship financially. Even with everything being done it’s being reported we will record loses this season that might land us a minor fine from UEFA in regards to FFP.

Every move should be calculated and within our means, we can’t rush things and aim for high value players or high wages.

This is a long term project, we bore the first fruit of it by finally making it back to the Champions league.

All what we need now is to build on that success and make sure we are a staple in the Champions League for the foreseeable future.

Of course sorting the stadium issue is as vital for our finances, but bureaucracy gets in the way.

Before the window started, I would’ve said we needed a new RW and a new young striker to be very competitive next season. Now after losing Hakan, we have basically no starting CAM, the RW spot is still suspect, and we signed another old aging forward that has been lackluster in his last league for like 5 years now. Sorry, I don’t believe Giroud will cut it. 

And our management has seemingly refused to spend money. Before I get the “actually we’ve spent tens of millions this summer” I don’t count second installment payments on players we already have as spending money on new players, that is some Galliani levels of cope. And the rest have been nominal fees spent on loan players that have already played for us too, who let’s be honest are not starter material. I like Brahim but he’s a bench player let’s be honest. Or it’s money to cover the goalkeeper position, which wasn’t even an issue up until a few months ago, which just regresses us even further. Dont even get me started on the fact that we might be losing Romagnoli and Kessie too because those contracts still aren’t sorted out, and after fumbling Gigio and Hakan I don’t have much faith in that department.

HommoFroggy,1628158554.0,oyelsj,21.0,1.0,"I will start this with Maldini's idea of scheduling the last 2 matches. I was aware that Galtier was the new Nice coach and it is well known that his playstyle is very ""Italian-like""... he likes his teams not to concede first and then think about scoring. Likes his tall striker upfront and the rest of the team playing around him, a lot of energy in the midfield and frustrating the opposition. What i didn't know was that Bordalas was the new Valencia coach. For context Bordalas was the Granada coach, the most frustrating team in La Liga. Again, he puts emphasis on defending first and then countering. Sure both teams have new coaches so their teams are not as established as we would have liked to estimate where we stand but also, Nice was 2 weeks ahead in athletical perpetraton and Valencia 1 week. So these 2 matches conclude our preperation for Serie A. The next friendly will be against Real, so a more UCL based match rather than Serie A based one. 


So about yesterday's game... the thing that i want to emphesize is the idea of us being good because Valencia left too much soace rather than us opening the spaces our selves and we will not get that space in Serie A. I will say that we will not have the desparity in Serie A in athletical preparation that we had vs Valencia so expect even better performances in contrast to this aspect. I will not speak about every player because i don't think that is important to say that ""Conti bad or Castillejo bad"" for example. 


 - Maignan: One save, which was made by a good positioning of his because he wasn't tested much. His build up from behind, top top notch. He made a 30 meter in the ground pass which was exquisite. His ability to play like that will help us a lot considering the way we play. 


 - Tomori and Romagnoli: Personally i liked them a lot, they delt pretty good when faced with numerical disadvantage in the counter. Valencia really tested us in 1 occasion. But what i saw was that idea from last year that when we get bombared with crosses we suffer, happened in a couple of occasions last game also. Romagnoli seems quite good... noticable that having a pre season and being rushed into a season like last one without a pre season makes a big difference. If we recuperate the 2017-18 and 18-19 Romagnoli... difference maker. That Romagnoli is a top 5 CBs in the league we all know that. 


 - Balo Toure: Liked him a quite a lot going forward. He seems a movment fullback so far. Seems to suffer a little bit with the ball in his feet, not so clean as one might want him. Defensively, his work rate isn't discussed let's be fair but can imorove a lot. Still early to estimate and also he is a vice-Theo... he isn't our starter so that is the context. 


 - Tonali: I have seen comments like ""Tonali played better against Nice""... i have no idea where that came from. Tonali was so so good in that match. Yes the odd mistake here and there but his way to link up midfield with attack was top notch, great positional awareness and did quite well defensively in most cases but also was forgotten in attack sometimes and we conceded 1 or 2 very dangerous counters cause of that. 


 - Pobega: In my opinion he was really poor. Went missing for extensive minutes in the first half, not clean when had the ball. Idk what to say about him really, in the second half our midfield was so poor that we literally went every time from defense to attack neglecting the midfield entierly. 


 - Brahim Diaz: **YES** I don't have to comment about this... The only thing that he suffered was that in the second half we removed both Maldini and Tonali so Valencia knew that if we would create anything it would come from him so they put 3 man on him. 


 - Maldini: Clean game from him yet again. The odd mistake here and there ofc. His movment and combination play to not leave points of reference between him and Diaz was a joy to watch. He also had a good freekick, not a surprise because he used to score a lot in Primavera with freekicks. He got into good positions inside the box, wasn't surved much and i would have liked to see him shoot more from distance. 


 - Leao: He had a good game not leaving points of referneces to the opposition but also moved in synchron with Maldini and Diaz so there was someone to attack the box or open up space for him. Got a goal disallowed, more than a fair goal. Yea, pretty good all around. Honestly, when you have players that attack the zone when Leao drops off like Maldini for example it looks good when Leao plays as a CF and drops to get the ball and dribble... when you don't have them he looks like an idiot. In the case when he dribbled 2 man in the left side, out a great ball in the middle there were 3 people in the box, Toure, Maldini in the other post and Diaz in the middle. That looks good, that looks really good. 


 - Krunic: Weak match from him, he doesn't do near as good as a midfielder... he is a mezalla. 


 - Sale: Better than last match, not as good as one might want. Sure he played off position because we needed to shop Casti around for him to be sold. That surely affected his performance... yet again, i remember him last season in pre season... didn't look that good, got into match fitness a little bit late. 


 - Giroud: Yes his link up play is great, we all know that. 


 - Theo: Less hot headed than last game so he did better. 


- Rebic: Idk what to say, got one chance and invisible after that... not that the others did much more than him  tbf. 


 - Calabria: Looked way better than last game, more confident with the ball... he is comming off a bad injury so he needs time. 


 - Kalulu: Had a good game as a CB, got a very good tackle and did well in the air. 


 - Gabbia: Defensively i didn't like him much. Got caught a couple of times if i remember correctly, 3 times. Offensively, from the 60th minute on he played as a regista basically... everything went from his feet to the attack. Got a great pass to Casti which was offside. Also his RB experiment has made him progress the ball with his feet as well, something that he suffered a lot last season.",ACMilan,Valenzia vs Ac Milan game summery,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/oyelsj/valenzia_vs_ac_milan_game_summery/,2021-08-05 18:15:54

HommoFroggy,1628015451.0,ox9oon,40.0,1.0,"Daniele Maldini has shown to be quite a talent. In my opinion, it is quite clear that he has the technical ability to become a top top player. This can be illustrated [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W70uEh2E3B4) when Leao was asked who is the most talented player in the Milan team? He answered ""Daniel Maldini"".  As a curious person, i wanted to know how good was Maldini at the youth level in relation to other Italian players. So i took as base young Italian players under 25 years old and compared their time in the primavera level with Maldini's time in the primavera level and the results are like below.

PS: All the players have had their playing time between the primavera A, B, and C so it isn't something exclusive to Daniele. The stats are taken from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) so anybody can check the stats themselves. To conclude, i know that this format doesn't create a complete picture but it creates some context. All it shows is a very limited assessment of Daniele Maldini's offensive output in relation to other Italian players. To become as good of a player or a better player, he needs to work hard and of course a little bit of luck.

^(Table) ^(formatting) ^(brought) ^(to) ^(you) ^(by) [^(ExcelToReddit)](https://xl2reddit.github.io/)

I want to say this out of the bat. In my opinion, Daniele is a very similar player to Kai Havertz. Similar physical prowess, a similar technique, and understanding of the goal and space. It is hard to compare two young players between two different youth systems but in an ideal situation, it can be seen that both players had a similar end product in their youth levels. Saying this, the most obvious thing that can be taken from this table is the fact that Daniele is the second most efficient scorer after Kean (if we disregard El Hilali which is playing primavera football next season as well). While being the 3d most efficient goal contributor after Amad Diallo and again Kean. Something interesting is the fact that Maldini's assists x min ratio is among the worst above. Daniele has the ability to become a total offensive footballer, i really hope to see more of him this season.

I want to touch a little bit on Olzer and El Hilali... Olzer another profile which differently from Maldini likes the wing a little bit more while being quite good through the middle... hoping he develops into a good player at Brescia considering we have a buyback clause on him. The surprise surely is El Hilali, at 18 years old has lightened up our primavera last season and honestly, he is the main reason to follow Ac Milan primavera.

GK: Maignan

RWB: Calabria  
MC: Tonali  
MC: Bennacer  
MC: Kessie  
AMC: Diaz / whoever we end up signing  
ST: Ibra  
ST: Giroud

If Romagnoli can keep his performances up, that's a very solid back three, and it would give Theo and Calabria more freedom to roam on the wings. At the same time they could defend too, basically creating a back five if/when necessary, and at other times pushing further up to help the midfielders.  
The midfield would also be pretty strong, and we might get more out of Tonali, since he tends to do better in a three-man midfield. We would obviously need another AMC in addition to Diaz, and then we'd have a new striker + Leao and Rebic who could fill in for Ibra and Giroud.

HommoFroggy,1627808254.0,ovostb,37.0,1.0,"So i catched up with yesterday's friendly game and i thought of making a summery  touching upon some common comments that i found in yesterday's match thread during the game. 


- Maignan: I understand the frustration of some people will our new keeper in 2 scenarios that freekick and that ball in the air whuch he miscontrolled. I don't think that saying ""he didn't do good"" has no basis, but for sure other things should be taken in consideration. 2 great aspects that we can take from his game.... One, he ca do the mistakes now so Dida can work on them. Two, he is great with his feet and will let us play with a higher line because he can screen the defense. I played back that clip of his pass under 4 man pressure to Tonali which was played in the space to where Tonali would have moved in a split second. 


 - Tomori and Romagnoli: Both CBs started the game very well honestly. Tomori in the second half seems like he got tired and lost a little bit of brightness in his decision making. Multiple times that scenario happened where we wanted to counter, Tomori went forward, we lost the ball and he had to track back. Sometimes he got into a defensive position and sometimes, no. About Romagnoli, idk what to say... great match. The guy was playing at the level he did under Gattuso. He had looked great in both friendlies that we played before but this was a taugh one. Nice players were very direct they went hard. A Romagnoli in this form is a season changer. 


 - Gabbia: Like this Gabbia might be a major added value. I will be beating a dead horse by now... but, he looks so good as a rightback. Also very solid defensively yesterday as well. Maybe because Nice players got tired. But, Caldara for example found ways to fuck it up while Gabbia was always cleand and on point. 


 - Theo: Too hot headed yesterday, the opposition mirror RB got to him and he had a very irritating match to watch. Better this match to happen now than during the season vs Lazzari for example or whoever. 


 - Tonali: Tonali was around a very good-ish level yesterday but with periods. First 20 mins very good game, got lost for 15 min. Got better in the last 10 mins. Held a stability during the second half. Some heavy touches here and there. Was the main ball progressor yesterday. You can see him grow as a player in a hard game and you can see his personality. If he keeps this up. Again, another added value. 


 - Pobega: Don't want to bash on the guy because i don't think he did that bad for who he is. He got overwhelmed by the level of the match. It happens. He can grow during the season but atm, he isn't ready and we need another midfielder, especially because Krunic plays way better further up the pitch. 


 - Krunic: In my humble opinion MOM. Sure he isn't starter material but ye, excellent rotational player. 


 - Brahimino Diazino: Again i understand what people critiqued him yesterday that he got invisible. But, from what i noticed... He started the first 20 mins very well alongside Tonali. Made some if his dribbles and tried to close up attacking scenarios. He really suffered that 15-20 mins where we couldn't do anything, where Tonali and him couldn't find anyone above the midfield. Krunic to a certain extent as well, in 2/3 scenarios if i don't remember wrong. The most valid critique is that Brahim could certainly drop way deeper when those situations happen and help. If i am not mistaken Pioli was screaming at him to do that. He did that in the last 7-8 mins, because of that Tonali got more room to play and we played a good 7-8 last mins. Yea, i didn't see this horror show from Brahim honesty. 


 - Sale: Yeaaaaaa... he was pretty bad. Him at the right and Theo on the left, main reasons to why we had issues that game in my opinion. Pioli was screaming at him all game long ""don't let them mark you"". When he wasn't marked, he was losing balls left and right. When he needed to go wide he was in the middle in a crowded zone and when he needed to be middle he was wide. Learning experience that is for sure for the guy. 


 - Leao: Had a decent+ game... idk what to say more than that...  Tried to do something, couldn't play off anyone. Quite isolated... when he made something happen, nobody was in the box. A more organized game by him... not to the level we want but he tracked back a lot this game. 


 - Rebic and Giroud: Found esch other nicely sometimes.  It shows that Rebic is quite good at playing off these kind of strikers, Mandzukic, Haller, Ibra. Good instances, but thats that. Giroud, got into the match very fast. Scored a goal, gave us attacking presence. Marshallah, if he continues like this during the season... great piece was added to our roster. 


 - Maldini: Showed great presence and technical ability in a hard game. During the season he needs more game time. He has the ability to become someone, needs the right nurturing. Didn't say anything new here. 


In conclusion, it was a positive match considering the circumstances. The most positive note in my opinion takes the defense, because it was a truly harsh game.",ACMilan,Summery of yesterday's game of Nice vs Milan,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/ovostb/summery_of_yesterdays_game_of_nice_vs_milan/,2021-08-01 16:57:34
