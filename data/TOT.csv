SwaggyB721984,1601237431.0,j0xxpf,0.0,1.0,"***FIRSTLY, LET ME APOLOGIZE FOR THE LENGTH OF THIS POST, PLEASE FORGIVE ME &amp; LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS AGINST FORUM ETIQUTTE***

I, like many of you, am feeling as though my whole week (longer?) has been ruined based on VAR screwing us &amp; now hearing the news about Sonny. That being said, up until the end of today‚Äôs draw w Newcastle United, I was feeling very positive about Spurs and the 2020/21 campaign. I felt it was a perfect time to share my reasons for optimism to help my fellow *CRUSHED* Spurs supporters try to keep things in perspective. Let‚Äôs be real, NOBODY needs additional negativity in their life rn!!! 

1. RECENT FORM, INC. TODAY‚ÄôS MATCH - I was absolutely buzzing about the match and although I am still a pretty new football fan, it was obvious that we started much better today than we have all year! We controlled (dominated) possession for the entire first half and most of the match, while we created chance after chance &amp; although Sonny hit 2 posts his quality of shot was amazing. Darlow the Toon keeper was out of his head making 11 saves including about 5 point blank stops so credit to him where due, we won‚Äôt face that every week. Non ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù like Ndombele, Bergwijn, Lucas &amp; Lamela showed quality w the ball &amp; aside from a very strange clearance attempt (what a meme!) by Davies in minute 89, the defense cleared the ball well and didn‚Äôt give up many chances. 

That‚Äôs my ‚Äúeye test‚Äù reading but the xG stats back it up: &gt;3.5 for Spurs, &lt;1 for Newcastle. We had 23 shots to 6 w 14 on target to 2(!); most telling is we had 4% conversion! The worst finishers in world football could not keep that up long, so overall we‚Äôre improving rapidly on both sides of the pitch! COYS!

2. CRAP-DECISION ‚ÄúKARMA‚Äù - I know it‚Äôs hard to think this way right now but the same thing that cost us today (idiotic meddling with laws of the game from the powers that be, for no explicable reason) is bound to help us later this season (hopefully they squash this handball law crap after this year!)&amp; we will have a crap-handball or two go FOR us this year also, inevitably. Things tend to even out over time! 

3. OTHER ‚ÄòBIG SIX‚Äô RESULTS IN EPL - aside from Liverpool, just check the scores and you cannot help but feel we could have lost a lot more w today‚Äôs outcome if the other top teams were bringing it like they have in previous campaigns. Leicester, West Brom, Crystal Palace and Liverpool have helped us out by taking points from Man City, Chelsea, United and Chelsea, respectively. Thank you very much, maybe the whole world isn‚Äôt out to get us, after all!

***BTW Wolves are now down 3-0 to West Ham w 24 minutes remaining!

4. MOURINHO PRESS CONFERENCE QUOTES ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM - Let‚Äôs just say that Jos√© has a bit of a history of erratic comments with the media, especially when he feels hard-done; he is known for ‚Äúlashing out‚Äù. That‚Äôs no surprise to anyone but he also has had a tendency in the past, especially after losing points or being ‚Äúwronged‚Äù, to express his ‚Äúsulkiness‚Äù by being dramatic. I have no info about Sonny‚Äôs hamstring other than the vague ‚Äúhe will be out for a while‚Äù (or ‚Äúhe will be out a long time‚Äù, depending where you read it) that everyone else has seen online, but he didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain during the half he played and we have no specifics about how he got injured! We are inferring that he has a long-term injury because of what was said by Jos√© at a time when he likely felt ‚Äúf***ed over‚Äù, felt like he didn‚Äôt owe anyone anything, and I would not put it past him to be purposefully vague in order to draw sympathy &amp;/or give himself a reason to cut short a press conf that he probably didn‚Äôt want to have to give in the first place! I don‚Äôt want to falsely get anyone‚Äôs hopes up, but it‚Äôs plausible the injury isn‚Äôt the worst case scenario we all are thinking so let‚Äôs not make too many assumptions just yet! I choose to stay optimistic that we‚Äôre going to get an ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as bad as we thought at first‚Äù update in the next 24-48, until I hear otherwise. ‚ÄúPrepare for the worst but expect the best.‚Äù Wise words and appropriate here, imo

5. LUCAS, BALE &amp; BERGWIJN (&amp; LAMELA?)- I thought young Steven Bergwijn showed class today after coming on &amp; despite some possible early-season rustiness he created chances, controlled the ball &amp; looked like scoring. IMO he is the 2nd best (3rd w Bale) winger in the squad, &amp; would have scored if his shot in the box was better/Darlow wasn‚Äôt in the zone. No disrespect to Lucas but I honestly feel Bergwijn should have started since Matchday 1! His attitude is great; has a level-head &amp; doesn‚Äôt beat himself up but is accountable &amp; wants to be out there, has a great celebration, &amp; he absolutely MELTED Slab Head (round 2 next Sunday... ding ding!üòÉ) I for one have been waiting eagerly to see this classy young talent do his thing again in a Spurs shirt, &amp; with a full offseason of training &amp; learning, fresh legs &amp; a desire to prove he can feature in the EPL, Bergwijn getting playing time will only help us! No he isn‚Äôt on Son‚Äôs (orBale‚Äôs) level, yet, but I have faith since he has been nothing but positive &amp; consistent! If Son needs time let him get back to 100%, and hopefully(üôè) be back for Bale‚Äôs debut; just keep your fingers crossed Jos√© doesn‚Äôt start Lamela instead (actually, he‚Äôs looked good too off the benchü§î)!",Tottenham,5 Reasons I to be Positive after Spurs 1 - 1 Newcastle (*NOT A TROLL*),1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tottenham/comments/j0xxpf/5_reasons_i_to_be_positive_after_spurs_1_1/,2020-09-28 04:10:31

After signing 6 players, 5 of which potential starters and 1 being Gareth Bale, they had a 9/10 window in my opinion. Many expected the club to bring in a center back, with strong links to Milan Skriniar throughout the whole summer, however that deal never seemed to come into fruition. However, yesterday we have been linked to Joe Rodon from Swansea and a mystery additional center back (Dael Fry being my guess) to come in by October 16th. My question is, how do you see them being able to instantly improve the team? Do you think signing these two youngsters gives us enough depth at the position and also makes up for not signing Skriniar?

The biggest differences in my opinion is in squad depth, quality and (I hate to say this, sorry Poch) a manager who knows how to win.

With Liverpool, City and United not looking their best, I‚Äôm started to believe we are proper title contenders this season.

I‚Äôm quite happy that we‚Äôre almost flying under the radar, with pundits proclaiming after yesterday‚Äôs emphatic win that ‚Äúmaybe Tottenham should be considered for that 4th spot come May‚Äù.

 1st I heard, it was never a red. Well any physical contact with face meant in violence is a straight red. Regardless. 
 Then I heard why Lamela was not in the wrong. Well he was, and if Martial had gone down, then the red would never have happened. After watching All or Nothing, this is what Mourinho spoke about. Get someone sent off if they break the rules, don't stand up and react like we used to do. Become Salah and go down any touch. 
 So then they quote Ole with, it's disgraceful behaviour to fall to the ground like a child. I would have spoken to him over that. That is not football..... This was my favourite to answer. How short memories they have. Let's look at last season where Fernandes threw himself to the floor over no contact and only VAR saved our asses. I am sure Ole was happy with that and did not 'have a word' because in the next match Fernandes stamped on a defenders leg and went down and got a penalty. 

 The double standards with Utd fans is out of this world. Imo, was it a red, yes. Were Pogba, Bailly and Shaw's were all red too. And yes it would not have been wrong Lamela getting a yellow, as jusling for space and made neck contact, but it's hard to prove intent. Either way, ref did them a favour. Even made sure they all got yellows so no retrospective action could be taken

Steven Bergwijn, Gareth Bale and Lucas Moura has scored three goals between them. Not good enough. So, would you start Erik Lamela in that position. This article looks at why the Argentine should be the starter since his return to training.

AlexanderILP59,1613284346.0,ljj6n3,15.0,1.0,"With our current form and the overseas players problem I've gotten some of my ideas down, First, we really REALLY need a competent CB, it's the place that's needed fixing most in our squad. Selling Davidson Sanchez should get us some money to spend , and it also allows another overseas player to be bought, personally, I still think our Last' summers target Milan Skriniar should be our target again, he's very competent and an overall great defender. Loaning or Selling Doherty/Aurier to some club like milan would help free up space, where we could get Max Aarons, a young speedy full back who had previously played in the PL with Norwich, one of the side's better players. Lloris is very likely an important target for Mauricio Poch's Psg side, and we have a lot of keepers we could sign, but signing a cheap keeper is most likely. But for me, Burnley's Nick Pope should get a chance at spurs, he's been one of the best if not the best player for Burnley, and currently almost edging past Pickford for the England First team. So this is how my planned backline would look(considering Real Madrid don't sign Reguilon back)  
S. Reguilon T. Alderweireld M. Skriniar M. Aarons  
N. Pope  
I wouldn't change much in our Midfield, we're assuming Dele Alli is sold, M. Sabitzer is the best player to replace him, We've tried to sign him Jan but didn't in the end, adding him would add so much to the attacking front, with Hojbjerg and Ndombele playing in a double Pivot. We should sell Winks as he is really struggling to play for his position in the starting 11, and we also have the very excellent CDM Oliver Skipp in Norwich, where he has flourished under the Canaries, and he would play a good second choice behind Hojbjerg. My midfield  
M. Sabitzer

P.E. Hojbjerg   T. Ndombele  
Harry kane is said to leave spurs if we don't win a trophy this season, even though We are in the Carabao cup final and have a good chance in the UEL, if we fail to win them, we are most likely to lose our Best player, now it's worth noting that no player we sign can possibly replace kane, he played a vital role in every position of the squad, he dropped down a lot to start counter attacks, gave players like Son great chances to score, and scoring from every angle and stuff, it's impossible to say how much of an impact Kane has had in the club, and we won't replace him. But a striker is a  first then, and considering we would get a lot of cash by selling him, Danny Ings should be a good striker, he said that he wants to move to a Champions league club, and if we can into the top 4 we have a great chance of signing him, and if we don't get to the top 4, at least he'll get  a chance in the Europa league,  and if we, hopefully, win a trophy we can get Kane to stay, and the same applies to Son. Here's my attacking line  
S. Bergwijn                         H.M. Son  
H. Kane

Strange_Grape_1374,1613095211.0,li0ye1,17.0,1.0,"So this is my list of things to do in the summer transfer window: I am predicting a big one. So here are some of my most wanted transfers and departures in regards to our club.

So first in regards to Dier, he is a very nice player, does great crucial blocks, but his misses and blunders are costing us points. I think selling him should be a good idea, could sell for $25m to $30m. (his market value is $27.5m right now)

next, if Mourinho is not gonna play Dele, we need to sell him. He is just eating up wages in the reserves right now. PSG is offering $45m to $50m I think, and negotiating that deal to sell him will be great. 

Bale is probably going back to Real Madrid or retiring to play badminton or golf (lol). he is taking so much wage, we can't just keep him on our bench.

In regards to Harry winks, I just don't know. Sure, he did a massive blunder against Everton that cost us the game, but that is probably of his bad form because Mourinho isn't playing him. Selling or keeping him will change throughout this season's second half.

Davinson Sanchez. hmm... I think we could sell him. First Mourinho isn't playing him, and even when he is playing, he is inconsistent. Plus, he is kind of unhappy in the club, so he could be a big bulb of money: about $50m when we sell him. 

Vinicius. Well, it is kind of hard to decide because he hasn't played many matches. However, his performances in the prem league are not very good. The decision on whether to give him back to Benfica will change throughout his performance in the second half of the season. As of now, I don't think we should sign him for $45m.

Players to sign:

As I think selling Sanchez is a good idea, we need a new CB to replace him; a consistent one. And I think skriniar would be the perfect solution, as he is a great CB overall. Inter Milan said he will cost about $40 to $55m, and I think he will be worth it. 

If we fail the skriniar move, then the back-up option: Kim Min-Jae or Boateng. Kim Min-Jae could be a great mid-long-term CB for our team, but I don't know how he will play at spurs. Boateng is also a decent option since he wants more game time and he is an experienced defender. Boateng could be a great defender to manage the defence with toby or rodon as Thiago silva has done to Chelsea. 

If we are selling 2 midfielders in the summer (dele and maybe winks), we need to sign at least one. And that signing, could be either one of these two choices; Sabitzer or Riqui Puig. Sabitzer, you know, is a heavily-linked player with Tottenham. he could provide some real good plays, for $45m (approx.). And the next player is Riqui Puig. yes. totally unexpected, but reasonable. This player could provide some really creative and decisive passes in the midfield, and possibly become Tottenham's ""Xavi"". If Koeman is looking forward to selling him and not using him, he could definitely be a great option for Tottenham, as we need more creativity and quality passes in the midfield. Another possible transfer target is Mac-Allister, the Brighton midfielder. The chances on him will depend on his performance in Brighton throughout this second half of the season. 

In ST's position as a back-up of Kane, I think it is a good idea to call up Troy Parrott. Sure, he isn't performing well on the loans right now, but anything could change. We should give this lad a chance. 

I want to say more, but don't want this to become an ultra-boring passage, so I will stop here

overall, these are the players that I will be happy that Tottenham will sell and sign, and thank you for reading this!",Tottenham,Some good ways we could improve our team in the summer,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tottenham/comments/li0ye1/some_good_ways_we_could_improve_our_team_in_the/,2021-02-12 10:00:11

I am a life long Spurs fan and have recently been trying to get a fairly large screen print of the old stadium with fans done on canvas. The problem that I am having is that all the old pictures that I have access to through google are very distorted when blown up and getty images are trying to charge insane amounts of money. If anyone has any cool high-quality pictures of the old stadium and would like to help create a centerpiece in my home I would love to see them. Also if anyone has other recommendations of where to look they're also very welcome.

neoBigBrother,1621598708.0,nhqvhk,3.0,1.0,"Harry Kane¬†has revealed how Jose Mourinho 'didn't bother much with sports science' during his failed 17-mont stint at¬†Tottenham¬†‚Äì but insisted that he had a great relationship with the Special One.

Mourinho was sacked last month just days before Spurs' Carabao Cup final against¬†Manchester City¬†with a fractured dressing room failing to get results having led the table at¬†Christmas.

Mourinho's negative brand of football was heavily criticised by pundits and fans alike, while the Portuguese boss claimed his coaching skills were 'second to none' before being shown the exit by Daniel Levy.

In an tell-all interview with Gary Neville on¬†The Overlap¬†YouTube channel, Kane explained how Mourinho wasn't big into sports science and preferred to focus on what happened on the pitch instead.¬†

In a massive contrast to former boss Mauricio Pochettino, Kane has said Mourinho instead left the Tottenham players to their own devices during his time as manager.¬†¬†

'It was pretty much completely different if I‚Äôm honest,' Kane told Neville when asked about the two managers' way of doing things. 'Just in the style of play, the way they set up, tactical training we would do.¬†

'Obviously Mauricio we do a lot of gym work, it was a lot gym base whereas Jose wasn‚Äôt so much into that but Jose obviously expected us to be men and act like men on the pitch, have leaders on the pitch.¬†

To be honest, that‚Äôs probably where it didn‚Äôt quite work out with Jose we didn‚Äôt quite have enough leadership that we needed at the time. Obviously the club was in a difficult stage, with Mauricio getting sacked it‚Äôs never easy a new manager coming in.¬†

'I think with Jose I had a great relationship with him, we got on from minute one. I think we understood each other, we had a similar mentality and how we saw stuff on the pitch, off the pitch and mentality in training so we kind of built that relationship.¬†

Again it‚Äôs a shame we couldn‚Äôt go on to win things but I‚Äôve been lucky enough to work with Mauricio and Jose, they‚Äôre two incredible managers that‚Äôs only helped me in my career for sure.'

When asked about Mourinho's approach to sports science, Kane explained how the Portuguese boss wasn't exactly against it and never wanted to 'babysit' the squad.¬†

It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs against it [sports science],' Kane added. 'It‚Äôs not like he says I don‚Äôt want you to it but it wasn‚Äôt what he thought of doing first and foremost. It was more on the pitch, this is what we need to do, this is how we need to set up.¬†

'Training on the pitch then he almost left you to be professional outside of it, he didn‚Äôt kind of look after it and babysit it.¬†

'We still had gym sessions that sports science guys would put stuff on but he wouldn‚Äôt, he kind of expected that almost. You know, we‚Äôre professional footballers, he shouldn‚Äôt have to tell us to do gym it should be a given.'

Kane went on to suggest how Mourinho's approach to coaching wasn't universally shared by other members of the Spurs changing room, which saw Mourinho have high-profile fall-outs with the likes of Dele Alli and Tanguy Ndombele.¬†

Jose‚Äôs got so much experience in the biggest of games at the biggest of clubs and that‚Äôs what I mean by saying we had a similar mentality in that aspect in doing¬†anything to win. And that‚Äôs the game. Jose just wanted to win,' Kane added.¬†

That was the mentality he was trying to put into the players at Spurs, do anything to win and I think like you said we did become more streetwise, but maybe there was relationships that didn‚Äôt quite work there but from my point of view, he was great for me.'

I was looking to get your opinions on the main strengths and weaknesses from Spurs last season and some realistic transfer moves and positions to be targeted to improve the team.

I run a Football/Football Manager themed blog [NormanProctorFM.wordpress.com](http://normanproctorfm.wordpress.com/?fbclid=IwAR1pl46xyDuU1mebWN8qB0Y-5YT0hNLX2Li_X6ofHur-5K_GGv4mk_-NdV4) and i‚Äôm starting a new series where I use the Football Manager game to simulate the 2021/22 season with realistic transfers for each Premier League club.

As I don't support every team in the league I am posting on as many fan forums and subreddits to hopefully get a more detailed insight from fans to make this series as engaging as possible!

Wow. Can't believe I'm writing this right now. 

I usually try understand the business side of football, it's not why I follow the sport, but its a big part of the sport.

But right now, I am sickened by the way we are handling our business. 

I don't blame any coach for not wanting to come work for us as they have seen how we treat our staff and managment. 

Sacking Poch was a mistake, but I gave Jose a chance, we sacked him a week before the final he brought us to and we lost, and now with this absolute fiesta of manager talks we are having I am starting to get a real bitter taste in my mouth.

Already Paratici is disappointing me with how he has handled his first task at the club. 

Not to mention Kane wanting to leave, and after this I wouldn't be suprised to see Son not sign that new contract that was just announced. 

I started following this club because 6 years ago i fell in love with a young attacking side with a ton of passion, a dedicated manager, and a fan base that was supportive even after years of disappointment. 

But right now I have never been closer to looking for a new squad to get excited over. Not because of our players or our performances, I can deal with loses, but the wau we conduct our ourselves as a club is absolutely disgraceful.",Tottenham,Questioning my commitment,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tottenham/comments/o20cet/questioning_my_commitment/,2021-06-17 23:45:57

I wanted to take a wild guess at what our starting eleven could potentially look like if we get Antonio Conte as manager for next season. Being both a Spurs fan and also an Inter supporter I feel like I have a decent idea of how Conte would like the team to play. A couple of decisions may seem a bit weird at first but let me explain.

Formation: We know that Conte clearly prefers a 3-5-2 which is what he used at Inter, juve and sometimes at Chelsea. I'm expecting that he would also choose the same formation if he comes to Spurs.

Defense: Rodon - Andersen - Alderweireld. I choose these three players simply because they seem like our best options assuming that we sign Andersen from Fulham. Knowing how Conte likes his teams to play, i think we can expect the central defender of the three to be furthest back and playing like a traditional center back, while the other two push more forward and have quite a few offensive responsibilities. This is how Conte likes his defense to be which isn't always easy to pull off. Godin and Skriniar both had trouble playing like this, as they were NOT chosen as the central player of the three center backs and therefore had offensive duties which they couldn't always pull off. It think the three players i've chosen has a decent shot at adapting to this formation but we will have to see.

Wingbacks: Reguilon - Doherty. Reguilon is self explanatory. He had an overall good season for us and it is clearly on the offensive side which he is the most useful while his defense is sometimes questionable. Switching to a wingback position instead of a fullback could help him be more useful for the team. The same goes for Doherty. He hasn't always looked comfortable having too many defensive duties which is also why I could see him perform much better as a wingback. It is also this position that he played for Wolves where he was amazing. Hopefully we can see his form return as a wingback.

Midfield: Sissoko, Eriksen (yes, let me explain), H√∏jbjerg. Ok Let be explain Eriksen first. As unlikely as it sounds, I think Eriksen returning to Spurs and also playing in the deep playmaker role is more likely than you might think. Conte likes to use players that he already know and can trust and Eriksen fits that kind of player. Their relationship wasn't very good when Eriksen first arrived at Inter, but that has all changed, which is why Eriksen managed to play such an important part of Inters title winning team this season, being a regular starter since january. It took a while, but Eriksen very much managed to play the position of a nr 6 in the way that Conte would like him to. Also keep in mind that Inter have a lot of financial issues and are looking to sell some of their star players in order to make money (this is literally the reason Conte left it the first place, he didn't like the idea of having to offload players that are part of the starting eleven). If inter feel like they could make a buck off selling Eriksen, I think a return to Spurs may not be too unlikely as he obviously knows the club and the manager well, and has worked very hard to perform in the Conte system which could also be a reason he might want to return if Conte arrives. Other than Eriksen, I have Sissoko and H√∏jbjerg in the midfield. Conte likes to play strong and defensively good midfielders to cover over the playmaking nr 6. H√∏jbjerg and sissoko fits this role well. I know a lot of you don't like Sissoko anymore, but I think he would be one of the prefered options to play in this role and position if Conte arrives. H√∏jbjerg is self explanatory

Attack: Son - Kane. Also self explanatory. Conte always plays two attackers up front and Kane and Son is the ideal option here.

xRaven1991x,1622483665.0,np97qz,18.0,1.0,"This is without a doubt the biggest upcoming years for Spurs to recruit correctly, both on and off the field. Here is my breakdown of the current squad and who the next personnel could be to wear the famous Lilywhite colours. 

Thoughts and responses would be great :)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the number one priority for the Spurs board to get right this time, the manager. Personally I am not 100% sure who the right man is to take the club back to it's attacking/flair roots. If you polled 1000 Spurs fans before the latest Poch rumours broke last week, the votes would be all over the place. I don't believe the answer is a quick fix manager for the next 2-3 years, someone like a Conte or Allegri(recently appointed Juve manager). We tried that with the best coach in the last 20 years with Mourinho and although this is a result's buisness, the style of play at times was borderline depressing. Perhaps the route(albeit a risky one) is to take is a younger English manager who will put faith in the younger generation that the club is producing and see what development/impact they can have in the Premier League/Euro Conference League. The three candidates that stand out for me is Brendan Rodgers, Graham Potter and Scott Parker.

Let me know who you think/or want as the next Spurs boss.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the current squad :

1) Hugo Lloris. Will be his last season with the squad which will bring up a decade of service. Replacement needs to be lined up in January window to get to grips with the squad/staff and to take over the gloves next summer.

2) Matt Doherty. With news today that Aurier will be leaving the club, needs to hit the ground running in pre-season to prove he can be the player we all saw at Wolves. 

3) Sergio Reguilon. Vital to our attacking threat down the left. With his workrate and crossing ability, will need to keep injury free as cover at left back is the weakest area in the squad.

4) Toby Alderweireld. Needs a strong start to the season to cement his place as 1st choice centre back. His passing range and ability to play/come out with the ball put him streets ahead of any other CB at the club.

5) Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Leader and the main cog in any system we play. Future captain when Hugo leaves next season.

6) Davinson Sanchez. Thought he was the next Ledley few seasons ago, but his inability with the ball at his feet and his poor positioning means his excellent pace is irrelevant. Needs to be sold.

7) Sonny. Will need to be our go to 20-30 goals man if/when Kane leaves. Can hide away and go missing in the big games, will be needed to step up when we are lacking/being frustrated in certain games. Needs to sign that new contract ASAP.

8) Harry Winks. Has seen his stock decline over the last 2 seasons with the emergence of Pierre and Tanguy. His work rate off the ball is what lets him down despite being able to pass the ball with such precision. Another that needs to be sold with Skippy returning this summer.

9) Gareth Bale. Loan terminates next month and hints he will retire. Great servant over the years and that ability has not been lost as we saw on numerous occasions this season.

10) Harry Kane.  No one will begrudge him his move this summer. But we need players as part of any deal, not just a lump sump of cash.

11) Erik Lamela. A tale of what could've been for Coco if not for his recurring injuries. Another out of contract next summer, time to cash in on what little value he has left in the market.

12) Joe Hart. Stand in keeper who could be a great help for the future keeper incoming next season.

14) Joe Rodon.  Tough Welsh lad who despite only 12 premier league games looks tailor-made for this league. Will need an experienced partner along side him to reach his full potential.

15) Eric Dier. Long servant of the club whose time i feel should be up this summer. I still don't know his strongest position. Whichever it is, it's not good enough to be in the first XI.

17) Moussa Sissoko. Great workhorse in the centre of the park but another whose ability with the ball will always be questioned. With Skippy pushing to be starting and Tanguy 10 times the player with the ball, needs to be sold to get his wages off the books.

18) Gio Lo Celso. A shade disappointing last season(numerous injury set backs), not convinced he is a natural central midfielder.  Needs to operate behind the striker and interesting to see if/where he fits in under the new manager.

20) Dele. Flashes of that ability we all know he has when given starts under Ryan Mason. Falls into the Lo Celso category of where to play him, and could be sold if the price is right.

23) Steven Bergwijn. Gives everything when out on the pitch, but he himself would tell you he would rather be running at the defenders as oppose to tracking back to cover them. Needs to be unleashed like he was for PSV.

24) Serge Aurier. News broke today that he will be leaving this summer. Will be music to most Spurs fans ears, had horrific off field problems last season and let's hope we can recoup half of what we paid for him.

25) Japhet Tanganga. Future first teamer and fans favourite. Like Kyle Walker but 3 times stronger, needs to be given a run in the team if Doherty is not up to par.

27) Lucas Moura. Another whose work rate is phenomenal, but end product lets him down. Can't keep living off the Ajax game and needs a good season with 15+ goals or questions will be asked again.

28) Tanguy Ndombele. Biggest talent with the ball at his feet since Modric. If his work rate keeps increasing then he will be the first name on the team sheet. Still only 24.

33) Ben Davies. Another long servant of the club. But with the arrival of Reguilon, only a cup player at best. More interested in passing the ball 20 yards backwards than getting his head up to look forward.

45) Carlos Vinicius. Loan deal up next month and the club has no interest in making that a permanent deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Players on loan ;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Ryan Sessegnon. Plenty of game time for Hoffenheim last season. Wouldn't mind seeing him in the squad at Davies' expense.

\-Juan Foyth. Another player to leave and have a medal around his neck. Loan deal to be made a permanent one by Villarreal.

\-Oliver Skipp. Many Norwich's fans player of the season. Fantastic experience for him, needs to be starting 20+ games for us next season.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions to be strengthened/my ideal signings ;

GK to replace Hugo ;

\-Dubravka (Newcastle). Experienced head and great shot stopper, with a stronger defence in front of him can be a solid option for next 3-4 years.

\-Aaron Ramsdale(Sheff United). Future England goalkeeper who needs to be playing Premier League football. Will cost a lot less now the Blades have been relegated.

\-Alphonse Areola(PSG, loan at Fulham last season). Was impressed with his performances in a very poor Fulham team. Maybe Hugo can talk him into a move at the Euros next month.

&amp;#x200B;

RB to replace Aurier ;

\-Max Aarons(Norwich). Highly rated youngster who has had 3 solid seasons. Skippy will know how good he can be.

\-Luke Ayling (Leeds). Leader and fantastic work rate. Would'nt mind swapping him for Doherty.

\-Ben Godfrey(Everton). On the fringes of the England team but would have to break the bank to get him. Likely Everton have no interest in selling him.

&amp;#x200B;

CB to replace Sanchez/Dier ;

\- Jannik Vestergaard(Southampton). Monster of a centre half who takes no prisoners. Can also play with the ball at his feet, ideal partner for Toby or Rodon.

 \- Jamaal Lascelles(Newcastle). Skipper for the Toon who was vital in keeping them up last season. Another no nonsense defender who may want european football.

&amp;#x200B;

LB to replace Davies;

\-Oleksandr Zinchenko(Man City). IMO the 2nd most important area to strenghten if Kane leaves. Would provide great cover for Reguilon, can hopefully be used as part of the Kane deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Centre mids and CAMS we have enough players for.

&amp;#x200B;

Right winger to replace Bale/Lamela ;

\-Dwight McNeil(Burnley) Prize asset who would take a fair amount of ¬£ to sign. Ideal winger cutting in on his left foot.

\-Bernardo Silva(Man City). Another who could be used as part of the Kane deal. But has high wages and is unlikely to want to leave. But with Foden now the star boy and Mahrez's fantastic season, he may want more of a nailed down position.

\-Solly March(Brighton). The more likelier signing than the above two. Hampered by injury towards the end of the season, but had been Brighton's go to man to make something happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Left winger cover for Sonny ;

\-El Ghazi(Aston Villa) Finished the season very strongly for Villa. Can play on both flanks and knows where the back of the net is.

\-Adama Traore(Wolves). Speed merchant who does lack a final pass. Under the right management, could be a key asset to any squad.

\-Saint Maximin(Newcastle). Toon's top player and unlikely they want to part with him. Another Frenchmen who would do wonders on our wing.

&amp;#x200B;

Striker to replace Kane;

\-Gabriel Jesus(Man City). My ideal signing if swapped as part of any Kane deal. Super gifted talent who needs a run of 20+ games in the starting team. Would not want to play 2nd fiddle to another striker for the next 3-4 years.

\-DCL(Everton). Again a player highly valued by his club. But if we were to recieve 80m+ for Kane, we could test Everton's resilence with their new stadium costs around the corner.

\-Danny Ings(Southampton) Not my 1st choice but his finishing and workrate with the service of Sonny and co could net him 20-30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it guys! If you reached it this far thank you very much for your time. Anything from the above you disagree with or would like to discuss, drop me a comment and we chat further :)

Foreign_Cockroach888,1627318039.0,os2q2o,4.0,1.0,"Hi Tottenham Fans! SO, I don't know if it's official but you guys got Bryan Gil. I watched every La Liga game last season so here are some things you should know about him. He is only 20 and was already one of the best dribblers of La Liga on one of the worst teams. His play style is really fun to watch, but he doesn't put up much numbers. In the 2020-21 La Liga season he had 4 goals and 3 assists in 29 games. That should go up with Spurs, because Eibar (he was bought from Sevilla, but was on loan at Eibar) played really defensive football with few chances, and he had to create those chances (1.8 key passes per game, 9th in the league, and (1.5 crosses per game, 5th in the league). Eibar was relegated last season, so his team wasn't very good, and now he's coming to a Champions League team. He's a fantastic player, and one of my favorites, but I think a loan to a mid table club (Southampton, Leeds, West Ham, Aston Villa etc.) would do wonders for him. I think he has the potential to be a special player for years to come, but please have patience with him. He's only 20 and has never even played for a mid-table club and now he has to fight for Champions League football week in week out. His play style relies a lot on confidence to take on defenders, so tearing his confidence down won't help very much. You guys have an amazing player for tears to come, hope you enjoy him! I can give you updates on Lamela at the half and end of the season.

Tottenham has tried to build the team around Kane and for years we haven‚Äôt seen a difference in our performances (regarding trophies) but our best run at getting one was when kane was injured when we went to the champions league final when the team was built around Son. I‚Äôm trying to see how you guys think, if we sell kane and build around Son, our team could be the most deadly group in the league because we will gain roughly 150 million euros but if we keep kane then we have no money to build but we‚Äôll have an elite duo. I think having kane hurts us and makes us have tunnel vision. What do y‚Äôall think?

Romero has big boots to fill in Alderweireld's place but I believe the recipient of Serie A's best defender award, has what it takes to bring Tottenham back to the Champions League. He may even be the club's best defender since Ledley King. Here's a piece i've written about the Argentinian Center-back:

Living near the ground I used to walk there and pay ¬£3 on the door to stand in Paxton road end every home game from 88 until I had to buy a season ticket In 1998 season.
 
That was my passion along with music. I have seen some amazing stuff through the years (Gazza, Lineker,Klinsmann, bale),and some absolute toilet (Iverson, Freund, Doherty, I could go on and on)

But‚Ä¶.in this last few years I don‚Äôt know where I stand in this relationship with my first love, I find myself more and more embarrassed to be a Spurs fan. 

I have 3 sons who I was excited about bringing up as Spurs fans but it feels
So painful and fruitless because we are about to embark on another season under ENIC. A season of Harry our only shining light and beacon of pride being a local boy about to leave only to be replaced by sub pAr players only to
Watch him like Teddy, Berbatov, Modric etc go on and win it elsewhere.

So I‚Äôm at a point now where I feel I have fallen so hard out of love with this club‚Ä¶it could be because I don‚Äôt live local anymore or go games every week and that‚Äôs why I feel so removed from the club. levy is turning it into a global (and embarrassing) brand.

Looking to stay in the city but also wondering which station to stay closest to for easy access to the stadium.

Also is there much traffic out to Tottenham from the city?
