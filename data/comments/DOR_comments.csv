"Here to bring you the lols once again and warning you to prepare yourselves to be exploited. (I‚Äôm joking, I don‚Äôt believe any of this garbage).


**ITK 2 -** United didn't use full budget similar to last summer. Expecting January spending. Ole's job isn't safe, a bad run and not looking on pace for top 4 by January is seriously problematic.

**ITK 3 -** Analysis on United financial budget (MUCH MORE ON THIS COMING ON THE MUPPETIERS PODCAST THIS WEEK). United batting down hatches to exploit in January and Summer. 

3 major targets. 

RW - Sancho
CB - Upa/Skriniar. 
DM/CM - Saul/SMS (Saul already less likely following deadline deal for Partey)

Intention is to pursue one in January if clubs are out of CL. Rest next summer. Top 4/CL qualification required to pull this off. 

**ITK Scary (NEW, already very proven) -** United hierarchy believe they need a world class CB to plug in. Believes Axel/Mengi will challenge the starting 2. Upa too expensive this summer. 

United are now turning their attentions to contract renewals for TFM, Pogba, Greenwood and are looking to offer first team contracts for Galbraith and Mengi",g7x0rid,j13g1a,borussiadortmund,2020-10-07 01:52:02,Panchodmods,-16

While Id LOVE an extra CB(please heal and stay fit DAZ) and a proper 9 behind Haaland.. We still came out far better than I expected. I was genuinely worried about losing both Sancho and Hakimi due to that being the whole wing having to be reinvented and intergrated.

"The problem I saw was that there was no plan to adjust to the extreme compactness of Augsburg. An adjustment to the formation earlier may have helped.

That‚Äôs all on the manager.",g6r6irb,j08c9b,borussiadortmund,2020-09-27 08:48:36,Tra1famadorian,5
"Basically, I think it's quite good if you set a clear tactic and then try to carry it through against every opponent. But this is not the first time at the BVB that you have to realise that this unfortunately does not work and that a tactic that was good last week is no longer working. Augsburg wasn't aggressive enough at the beginning for their approach, but over the course of the first half they got a better and better grip on it, so that they effectively reduced and compressed hard the space in the centre, which the BVB pushed more and more into as the game progressed. I also think it's a good thing that Favre has been trying to make the centre more dominant than at the beginning of the game, and that he's letting more balls pass through there, but when an opponent is so compact, there are more spaces behind the opponent's FB that need to be attacked by running over them from the outer lane. But this has not happened for several reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, ours WBs played the way they did in previous games, by moving into the centre early on, where there were no spaces today, so that they were unnecessarily compacted, which initially meant that you were still dominant, because even when the ball was being retaken, you put a lot of pressure on the opponents, which also means that you lost too many balls or played dirty passes. At some point, even the best combination players find that the pitch is not enough. In the beginning you had a few good combinations, but with more strongly agressive (including shithousery) Augsburgers that was over and you often lay too fast on the floor. On the other hand Augsburg doubled well with the wingers/FBs, let the 3BL mostly be 3BL and maybe additionally made sure that both outer lanes preferred to move to the centre, because they too seldom got promising on- or off-ball 1vs1 against the Augsburg FB. Especially when you consider that they had no speed advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

As a consequence, Augsburg profited from this in the course of the game, even then using the empty outer lane, because they often tied the CB deep with a single striker in order to pull the BVB ever further apart, which they emphasised with opposing movements. As a result the compactness, which was at least good for recover the ball, was lost and Augsburg was given room for counterattacks. Essentially, they have played off both weak points of our 3BL, in that there is little danger of our lanes overrunning the opponent's FB over the outer lane, and our CB without compactness can quickly float into the water if you play it fast - so you can be thankful that not so many can do that. So, if you like, it didn't take long this season for a first coach to show how to play against the 3 halfbacks. The fact that this manager is Heiko Herrlich is already a signal. This was even intensified by our changes, as a result of which I no longer saw any structure in our game, as we continued to play a 3BL but many players were in positions that didn't suit them very well (3-4-3 diamond into 3-0-7), so the basic orientation was not changed theoretically, but in practice it was. That doesn't help if you are stuck in, but can't really fill it with more life, because the bank or the squad policy don't allow it.That is deeply related to our transfer policy in 19/20 when we wasted 55m‚Ç¨ in player who do not suits us in the defense.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example:When we play a 4-2-3-1 we play in reality 4-2-4 with Reus or whoever is the ""CAM"" and acts as secondary striker who is more finisher orientated which means our wings take over CM tasks and spaces and the FBs give natural width in the game.That means our CBs must defend into the depth aka run down duels (= give cover for the FBs) but Hummels and also Zagadou have not physical requirements.Additional both prefer to defense forward which is more suited for counter attack teams but against the majority of the league we have to make the match with the ball.Additional we need build up strong player but Schulz was never this guy he neved did for good reason he cannot do it on that lvl even Nagelsmann knew that.The WBs have to be involved even more in such tasks than as FB but the 3BL can make problems invisible but do not disappear them.I reduce the rest else it would be to much off-topic.

Of course, you have to add that physically this was not enough today, but a tactic has to be so good, given our number of games and the quality available, that you don't give an individually inferior opponent the chance to fight his way back into the game, as happened after 25-30 minutes today. Otherwise you have to be more flexible, because Plan A is not good enough against most teams. But maybe the Favre is not so wrong, because the game showed quite well that the 3-man chain is not the solution of all problems, even if it could hide them quite well so far.

Additional you want to play a high line but Hummels (Can the same) fucks off and tries to defend 20m forward which pissed me off which made our 3BL a 4BL with no FBs,1 RCB who played on the left and a HB who acts similar like Hummels but a lot more clumsy with technical limitations and less game sense.

Tl;dr: the approach was not bad for the circumstances but the execution was not good additional the 3BL is a good option to hide but not to solve the problems.",g6t6x4o,j08c9b,borussiadortmund,2020-09-27 15:58:53,-Vete-,5

THIS is the first season with a complete squad with only a few new players and probably no significant players leaving, except hakimi. ( Dont forget, Can and Haaland just joined us last Winter).
The real season where he has to show us what hes worth (Favre) is this one. He had some time now with the squad to form it. Now is the time bringing that on the pitch.

 To start a discussion about kicking a trainer essentialy after 3 games 2 wins one loss is simply stupid IMO. Or are you guys telling me we are like the blueturds who keep their trainer over the summerbreak just to kick him right after? 
Come on guys dont be like that, support the trainer and the team.

It comes the time where you question the ability of the coach to give the squad a plan B and spark ideas how to overcome an opponent who just walls.

"I do wonder at the recruitment policy. It's great to have attacking players with lots of flair and potential. But we also really need defenders and I don't see any incoming. 

Balerdi was a strange one. Looked decent at Boca. Didn't get a look in at Dortmund for ages. When he did come on I could see why! Did not look assured at all. Either a player who was just not good enough (then why spend that on him) or poorly coached, not sure. He's looked ok at Marseille tbh.

I do understand Bellingham. He gets forward and attacks from deep. He'll learn when to hold position and he's happy to tackle. He'll be a good player. So why is Mahmoud still here? Sell him and use the money, surely?

We seem overstocked at the 10 position. Instead of Reinier, couldn't we have loaned a promising central defender?

"Parking the bus and countering vs us is honestly a brilliant strat if youre physically strong.

We're really weak in the air, our 3atb is voulnerable to counters and we're generally weak physically centrally for combination play.

Augsburg read us like a grade-school book.

Copying my comment from another match-thread. 

Well-deserved win for Augsburg, extremely frustrating loss for us. Its like we learned nothing and having 0 aerial pressence offensively makes us extra easy to read offensively if the team is solid defensively.

And Im still pretty adamant that Reyna isnt starter quality yet. But maybe its due to injuries or not comfortable enough with Brandt taking that role, that he does. But Reyna is too easily bullied/shut down imo.

EDIT: Haaland in all his greatness, but he isnt good in the air. Especially for his stature. We should have gone for Andersson who went for peanuts and is more than Bundesliga-proven and would have given us not only a strong aerial/target option, but legit one of the best headers in the whole of Europe. Atleast our crossing would make sense then AND itd fit our budget AND give necessary depth. Now he went to K√∂ln but fuck... we need something like that in games like these because we have fuck all when it comes to physicality vs defensively good teams.",g6owqzw,j07yaf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-26 23:27:55,Qiluk,65
"Example A of one of the reasons why we never win anything. If you don't win against teams like Augsburg its very unlikely you will win the league. I know people will say ""It's just the start of the season"", but this is a long term issue.

Why were Bellingham and Reyna started for their 3rd consecutive game with better players on the bench? Why wasn't Delaney in there to prevent counter attacks alongside Witsel? Why wasn't Brandt starting at CAM to break down a stubborn defence? Why wasn't Reyna subbed when he was having a 'mare? Why are you playing through the center when its clogged up? Why is the team crossing when it's not working(36 times WTF?)? So many questions, so many problems and no answers.

It doesn't help that the ref is blind and Augsburg played dirty, but Augsburg defended really well. We just don't have a plan B,C,D or E and never have.

"I could only see the second half, but these are my thoughts. 

First off credit to Augsburg, they played like prime Atleti today. 

-I get that we play fluid, but I think some sort of structure would be nice. Most times we give away the ball because everyone is running everywhere. Our attackers always look to pass the ball, but no one is looking to receive the ball. 

-Meunier looked incredibly sloppy and awkward. 

-I don't know what Favre was thinking during the last 20 minutes. Throwing in 4 attacking midfielders isn't gonna solve the problem. We had no link between defense and midfield and we basically played it to the wing, back to the CBs, then to the other wing, back to the CBs, get frustrated, try a risky ball, lose possession. 

-We really miss Hakimi and his pace.",g6owvjk,j07yaf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-26 23:29:02,Ciao9,34

Reyna was shit today. Witsel showed 0 defensive ability. Haaland touched the ball like 3 times. Sancho tried to do smth but was annihilated by Gouweeleuw and Gruezo. Framberger performed surprisingly well for the fact that he is Raphael Framberger.

"It's tiresome to point out, but we're having the same problems since at least the beginning of Favre's stint:

-Inability to adapt when a team manages to totally annihilate our game plan by parking the bus;

-Terrible set piece defending doubled by awful offensive set piece execution;

-The frustration from our play having very little options makes players take stupid risks in the attempt to create space, giving the ball away to high xg chances in transition. 

I wished we could have shown some significant progress in this regards by now. I really don't get why we can't practice set pieces more, they could be a difference maker in games where we don't have space. Look at Bayern, even if they easily dominate games they're also a threat from dead balls.",g6p3zfu,j07yaf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-27 00:33:49,Sertorius777,11

Honestly I'm not too concerned, it's the 2nd game of the season and if we are to have these wake up calls it's better to have them as early on as possible to iron out the kinks. Only disappointing things were Favre taking Rapha early instead of Reyna and how quickly the team seemed to have given up after a goal.

Also, be gentle with the kids. Yes, they all collectively had bad games, but so did everyone else. Especially Jude and Reyna are still getting used to this level of opposition and are just 17 - it's normal to have a few stinkers and get scared and easily handled by more physical opposition - it's part of the growing process.",g6oxf7c,j07yaf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-26 23:34:03,nmrt,11
"Re-posting my original comment as I've just realised we have a new post-match thread. No need to up-vote again if you already saw it:

""The route up the middle was a clogged drain throughout. We didn't offer up enough to break it down in either half despite having a few tantalizing passes running through the box. A disappointing performance for sure.

Maybe we used up this season's allotment of goals against Augsburg already. They certainly didn't want to lose to us like they did last season.

I'll hope for Bayern dropping a point against Hoppenheim tomorrow, but it seems doubtful.

"Late to thread but I think we need to go with 4atb against teams that park the bus. 433 or some variation of it. Can can play in midfield since I'm still not convinced we get the most out of him playing CB. Or Delaney could play in midfield instead to break up counters and help the 2 CBs, and then Witsel/Can/Brandt/Bellingham as the two more forward midfielders. I noticed often times we would play the ball backwards yet there were open players on the cross-field diagonal. Either we need to play those cross-field balls, or switch the ball around quicker. Too many times I noticed a potential chance ruined by hesitation or a bad touch that allowed Augsburg to regain their defensive formation. Very frustrating game overall.

But Jude, it's his 2nd game in BuLi and isn't accustomed to the league fully yet, and still starting him? Favre easily could burn the kid out and that's the last thing he needs imo.

"Example A of one of the reasons why we never win anything. If you don't win against teams like Augsburg its very unlikely you will win the league. I know people will say ""It's just the start of the season"", but this is a long term issue. 

Why were Bellingham and Reyna started for their 3rd consecutive game with better players on the bench? Why wasn't Delaney in there to prevent counter attacks alongside Witsel? Why wasn't Brandt starting at CAM to break down a stubborn defence? Why wasn't Reyna subbed when he was having a 'mare? Why are you playing through the center when its clogged up? Why is the team crossing when it's not working(36 times WTF?)? So many questions, so many problems and no answers.

It doesn't help that the ref is blind and Augsburg played dirty, but Augsburg defended really well. We just don't have a plan B,C,D or E and never have.

"The route up the middle was a clogged drain throughout. We didn't offer up enough to break it down in either half despite having a few tantalizing passes running through the box. A disappointing performance for sure.

Maybe we used up this season's allotment of goals against Augsburg already. They certainly didn't want to lose to us like they did last season.

"Thought fuck it and listened to part of The Athletic podcast with Honigstein; nothing interesting but might as well summarise it.

- Honigstein thinks Sancho news won't be dominating the transfer window news for much longer, uses the fact that German media has completely gone silent on it as evidence of it.

I do think he underestimates English media and their ability to milk this one though.

- Chapman (I think he said it) says he spoke to somebody in the England NT camp and they said that Sancho staying is perfect for them cause it means Southgate can watch him and Bellingham at the same time and it's forming a partnership between the two. 

- Dortmund surprised by how fast Bellingham has settled in, was originally supposed to be eased in slowly over time.

- When it comes to Dembele, Aubameyang and Lewandowski (his example, not mine) there was a lot of unhappiness which led to the issues in their transfers and there were nerves behind the scenes over them potentially forcing a move. Whereas currently there's absolutely no nerves, no sense of unhappiness from Sancho and there's 0 nerves over him potentially forcing a move.",g66zwv7,iwvs9i,borussiadortmund,2020-09-22 15:22:58,CubedMadness,30

- Passlack. What a pleasant surprise appearance. Not a worldsbeater or a superb player defensively but in this system he came in on a whim and did very well. Very happy with his work today.

- Sancho. Looked like he was overthinking a few actions but his workrate was high and in the end delivered a beautiful assist. 

- Haaland.

- Hazards injury didnt look serious. He was in the stands watching and chilling for the second half. Probably just pulled his hammy a bit. 

- Reyna was getting manhandled early and our wings werent firing on all cylinders and that worried me but Gladbachs intensity died out and we took over. Thankfully.

Considering this is a tough first fixture and we have a history of fluffing the openings, Im happy. Especially if Hazard is fine.",g5udoox,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:28:27,Qiluk,82

"Erling is so good. Haven't seen target man work like that since Lewy wore 9. Midfield was weak with the 17-year-olds, but they still showed why they are budding superstars. 

Sucks for Toto, hope he recovers quick and so does Rapha. As an aside a shoutout for Passlack to shut down the left side completely, excellent performance.",g5uddrb,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:26:41,InexorableWyrd,55
"Haaland - just an outright animal

Reyna and Bellingham - hell of an introduction into the Bundesliga

Sancho - creativity and speed are excellent, but didn‚Äôt really turn it on until the second half

Meunier - excellent. brilliant positioning, stellar runs, brick wall defensively. already seemed to have developed chemistry with the lads.",g5uetf4,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:35:02,[deleted],41

"Noone is commenting on Muenier today. The guy was a beast. I was devastated when we lost Hakimi for ""only"" 40 mil, however, when I saw Muenier play today all that evaporated. The guy was great defensively on top of his good attacking runs.

Shoutout for Witsel for absolutely bossing the midefield, as usual, if it weren't for him Bellingham wouldn't have been able to play so comfortably.

Big shout out to Favre, for trusting the young talent. I was super surprised when I saw Bellingham and Reyna in the starting line up.

Contrary to most people here, I was not impressed by Passlack. But, it is not his natural position, so I can understand.

Akanji was immense, best game for him in a long time, while Can was a little bit nervous defensively but his forward runs and crosses were OP.

Great start overall! I am very optimistic.",g5usb06,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 03:58:58,blacktiger226,22
"Gladbach is often offering a good test for us, but then we always take them down in the end. Today marks another good result against ""A German Team"" hehe. It's a great way to start the Bundesliga too as we'll have to keep up with a super Bayern as long as we can. That always starts on Matchday 1.

Great performances around the team. The boys hardly put a foot wrong aside from a small handful of nervy moments. Otherwise, it was just about a perfect performance!

Who makes MOTM on this one guys? We have to give a special shout to B√ºrki's clutch save that kept it 0-0 early on. We launched off from that in a big way afterwards.

Final note: I was very pleased to see Felix step into Thorgan's wingback role and almost seem as though he never left us. Can't wait to see him grow here! üñ§üíõ

"Great season opener meanwhile United loses to Crystal Palace, you'd love to see it. Aside from Haaland and Reyna, I think Emre played quite well with defensive tackles and offensive runs on the right with Meunier. Passlack not amazing but better than expected, great work rate, and looks better than most of Schulz's game last season.",g5ue1b1,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:30:29,ZZZ0330,29
"Possibly the biggest strength of the 3 atb system is that it allows us to step off the gas and take fewer risks going forward without making it easy for the opponent to control the game while also being deadly on the counter.

In other words: we can actually secure a lead.

Also if anybody is wondering why Hummel's tackle wasn't a pen: to my understanding the ""problem"" is that VAR can corrects decisions that have a certain degree of leeway if there was a somewhat substantial error.

And this was a situation in which you don't *have to* give a pen because it's up to the ref to decide how much physicality the defender can use before it counts as a foul. Even if 9/10 times a ref would call the pen.

That's the big difference between these situations and situations where VAR corrects something like offside or handball which either happened or didn't happen with nothing inbetween.",g5ueroc,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:34:47,Loeffellux,13
"Huge game. I'm so happy with the way we played. Apart from that one nervy moment that forced a double save out of Burki, the team looked very comfortable at the back.

I hope the Hazard injury is nothing too serious. Would be such a blow to lose him for an extend period of time. Good for Felix to play reasonably well. Obviously, his chemistry with the rest of the guys was off, but he was a solid replacement.

I'm torn on man of the match. Both Akanji and Erling had great games. I guess Erling edges it due to his great holdup play today.",g5ue8sc,ivxvcy,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:31:47,me_meh_me,11

"Didn't watch the match and hence didn't see Felix's performance but judging by everyone's comments here, he seemed to play very good, which I am really happy about. Another product of our good development of young players.

Also another point I noticed is that Brandt and Marco were left on the bench, and they are arguably our best players on their day.

"Flawless 2nd half (except for that possible penalty Hummels ._.), not much to say other than the future is bright and we finally have enough depth to be a proper team and not just a starting XI.



Even though Haaland would have probably been my MotM even without the 2 goals, I wanna shoutout Felix Passlack. I had my doubts, I didnt hope for a lot, but he was always spearheading counter attacks, moved well offensively and had a good defensive shift, pretty much shutting down their entire left side (alongside Manu, who also had a stealthily good game of his own). Unreal respect for him to put such a good performance after his career at BVB seemed to stall out, and hopefully he can build on it.

"we're doing very well right now by being patient in build-up. I know lots of you still have flashabcks to previous seasons where we grew complacent after scoring which allowed our opponents the chance for a comeback.

But in the 3 atb system we've been really good at actually securing a lead. So forcing Gladbach into taking more and more risks is definitely the way to go.
 
And with the most efficient counters in the league last seasons, exploiting the risks our opponent's take is big strength of the 3 atb system",g5u8v7o,ivuvxx,borussiadortmund,2020-09-20 02:01:34,Loeffellux,5

"&gt;Pre-Game Presser: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAN7cE9AMuQ).

Summary:

* We're happy to have fans back in the stadium. Even an audience of 1200 made a considerable difference to no fans at all.
* Will B√ºrki and Guerreiro play? - ""We'll see."" \[B√ºrki probably will play. Guerreiro unlikely. ([German source](https://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/bvb/sprung-ins-kalte-wasser-bvb-auftakt-gegen-gladbach-wohl-mit-buerki-1556848.html))\]
* Reus worked hard, but we need to be careful with him \[More 3-second substitution goals incoming?\]
* Zorc: ""Pre-season prep is always like Trockenschwimmen \[dry swimming\].""
* ""Herr Favre, you said you are aiming to win the Pokal. What about the Bundesliga?"" - &lt;unintelligible mumbling&gt;
* Favre on Gio Reyna: He feels football. Good movement. Dangerous with assists and goals. He can read the game well. He can defend intelligently. There's potential to improve things, but of course he's only just 17.
* On the question of back three vs. back four: We got better after the transition to back three, ten months ago. But we'll train two or three tactical solutions.
* ""Is the squad better or worse than last season?"" - Favre: ""I don't know... &lt;smiles&gt;""
* Gladbach had a good season and they're very dangerous

"I'm still worried about our build up play. It is pretty poor with even limited pressure from a poor team. Witsel has to be more active and move in to space where he can turn; Hummels and Can should try both more penetrative passes as well as using Thorgan/Meunier as outlets; Gio and Sancho should anticipate a little bit more to move off their markers at just the right time.

I have not been confident in our build up from back. Whenever we face Bayern or Leipzig or really anyone who is organized and disciplined, we fail to build up and it hinders our offensive and defensive game. I really wish this changes this season",g59vgzd,ispmdl,borussiadortmund,2020-09-15 03:42:35,statefarmdotcom,4

This is just looking at the past year. The peak right before the huge drop off (due to corona) was when we beat psg in the first leg of the champions league. 

The low point right before that was when we got knocked out of the pokal, and lost 4-3 to leverkusen.

 The lowest point in the graph (pre corona) was when we lost 4-0 to Bayern.

 The first real downtick in the graph in October coincides with when our form was particularly bad, when we drew with schalke, lost to inter in the champions league

Borussia Dortmund steigt in den Frauenfu√üball ein, der Termin f√ºr den Startschuss steht bereits. Der Weg bis zur Spitze wird aber dauern.

Lange wurde √ºber das Thema Frauenfu√üball bei Borussia Dortmund diskutiert, eine Umfrage unter den Mitgliedern und Fanklubs des BVB gab es auch. Nun wird es endg√ºltig auf den Weg gebracht. Das teilte Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer Carsten Cramer auf der digitalen Fandelegiertentagung am Mittwochabend mit. Borussia Dortmund wird bald ein eigenes Frauenfu√üball-Team stellen. ""Wir werden das Thema ab dem Sommer 2021 besetzen. Wir werden das im Rahmen eines Dortmunder Weges aufsetzen"", sagte Cramer.

Frauenfu√üball soll beim BVB ‚Äûorganisch wachsen‚Äú
Gleichzeitig betonte er, dass es nicht darum ginge, von irgendeinem Verein eine Lizenz zu kaufen, ""sondern wir werden das von unten nach oben organisch wachsen lassen."" Die √úbernahme der Lizenz eines hochklassigen Vereins oder eine Fusion sind somit vom Tisch. Dennoch will der BVB die Sache ambitioniert angehen und ""so schnell wie m√∂glich nach oben kommen."" Cramer verwies aber mehrfach darauf, dass man dies nicht auf Kosten anderer Vereine in Dortmund machen wolle.

""Wir werden uns sicherlich √ºberlegen, wie viele Spielerinnen von einem anderen Verein zu uns wechseln d√ºrfen. Es kann ja nicht sein, dass f√ºnf Spielerinnen r√ºber wechseln und der Verein seine Frauenmannschaft abmelden muss"", sagte der BVB-Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer. ""Wir werden auch kein Geld ausgeben, das nicht auch andere Vereine in dem Umfeld ausgeben."" Die Borussia wolle sich sehr diszipliniert und fair bewegen.

Svenja Schlenker wird Frauenfu√üball-Abteilung beim BVB leiten
Ein f√ºr die √ñffentlichkeit neues Gesicht pr√§sentierte der Verein bereits, obwohl es erst in gut einem Jahr auf dem Rasen losgehen soll. Svenja Schlenker wird den Bereich √ºbernehmen und die Abteilung leiten. Momentan ist sie die Teamleiterin bei Borussia Dortmund im Bereich ""Live- &amp; Social-Marketing"". Schlenker ist bereits seit 2007 f√ºr den BVB t√§tig. Sie arbeitet nun mit einem Projektteam die Details aus und hofft laut eigener Aussage gegen Ende des Jahres mehr Details zu den ‚ÄûBVB-Frauen‚Äú sagen zu k√∂nnen.

Deepl translation:

Borussia Dortmund is entering women's soccer, the date for the kick-off has already been set. But the road to the top will take time.

For a long time, the topic of women's soccer at Borussia Dortmund was discussed, and a survey of BVB members and fan clubs was also conducted. Now it is finally on the way. This was announced by Managing Director Carsten Cramer at the digital fan delegate conference on Wednesday evening. Borussia Dortmund will soon have its own women's soccer team. ""We will occupy the topic from summer 2021. We will set this up as part of a Dortmund Way,"" said Cramer.

Women's soccer should ""grow organically"" at BVB
At the same time, he emphasized that it is not a question of buying a license from any club, ""but we will let this grow organically from the bottom up. The acquisition of a license from a high-class club or a merger are therefore off the table. Nevertheless, BVB wants to tackle the matter ambitiously and ""get to the top as quickly as possible. Cramer, however, pointed out several times that they do not want to do this at the expense of other clubs in Dortmund.

""We will certainly consider how many players will be allowed to transfer from another club to us. It can't be that five players are transferred over and the club has to deregister its women's team,"" said the BVB Managing Director. ""We will not spend money that other clubs in the area are not spending. Borussia wants to be very disciplined and fair.

Svenja Schlenker will head women's soccer department at BVB
The association already presented a new face for the public, although it is to start only in well one year on the lawn. Svenja Schlenker will take over the area and manage the department. Currently she is the team leader at Borussia Dortmund in the ""Live &amp; Social Marketing"" department. Schlenker has already been working for BVB since 2007. She is now working out the details with a project team and hopes to be able to say more details about the ""BVB women"" towards the end of the year.

"Halftime thoughts:

1) First off, pretty great performance from Rotterdam. Simeone would be proud. Very good defensively but lacking offensively just as the Rotterdam fan (u/petyrr) said. 


2) Get Favre and the subs some umbrellas or something, my man is struggling out there, sitting right in front of the sun. 


3) Who ever decided to give the ref a black and yellow kit?


4) Most interesting thing we've done is how we press when we lose the ball. Especially the famed front three of Re-Re-Re is putting in the work.


5) Marco is an absolute joy to watch as a football fan. The way he moves, dribbles and passes is so elegant, makes it look so easy. I only like watching maybe Messi more. He's beautiful and he plays beautiful. 


6) Camera angle makes my neck hurt even when I'm lying down.",g4cdk3s,io83tf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-07 23:54:11,Ciao9,17

Just not enough talent on the wings in this lineup/formation. Need someone that can win a 1v1 and get a good cross in cause going up the middle is going to be very difficult with how the other team is sitting in a block. Gio had a good first 20 but then seems to have dropped deeper. I think this is where we really will miss a player like hakimi is situations where we need lots of width and pace in the attack to spread the opposing team out and create spaces.,g4cd4hl,io83tf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-07 23:51:14,Darth_Tarth,6

Edit: on second thought, i think Mo might actually sit deep and Brandt and Reyna same height, so kinda a 3-1-4-2",g4c88wv,io83tf,borussiadortmund,2020-09-07 23:17:35,hellyesiguess,10

"Jakub B≈Çaszczykowski is famous for his strong character and his attachment to national colors. In an interview with Tomasz Sarara, he goes back to his beginnings in Borussia Dortmund.

""B≈Çaszczu"" says that when he moved to Germany, Poles did not have a very good press. He admitted that he was very irritated by that.
- *When I went to Dortmund in 2007, there was no good opinion on Poles. We were said to be stealing, working on construction sites, etc*. - he said. - *It hurt me a lot*.
It got to the point that B≈Çaszczykowski could not stand it when one of his colleagues at the first training camp in Borussia, made a joke about the Poles. There was almost a fight.

*During the first training camp, the guys from the team joked at the table. I was young, so I thought they‚Äôre not gonna just...* - he admitted. ‚Äì *I came up to them. That I was going to change my room. What a fuss‚Ä¶*

-*As time goes on, a person distances himself, but the perception of Poles has also changed a lot. It‚Äôs a nice thing. The distance between us and Germans has shortened. Of course, there are still some little digs, but it‚Äôs not the same anymore. They are also starting to appreciate that we can do valuable things* - says B≈Çaszczykowski, who emphasized that he made friendships in Germany that last until today, with Juergen Klopp for example.

-*It seemed to me that such a relationship is pretty normal, and then you go to another club and it is not there anymore. We recently had a video conference for the anniversary of winning the league.*

Lewy sometimes too, but to the way lesser extend.

They also beefed together when they were at BVB, and B≈Çaszczykowski was the instigator and he thought Lewy is a bit of a traitor because he was socializing more with the German core than with them.

So basically B≈Çaszczykowski sports the same tribal bullshit he is complaining about. He is the same crowd that goes ""why don't you leave Poland then?"" when some people have the audacity to criticize the Holy Virgin of all Nations - Republic of Poland.

"Ok, glad we had the chance to discuss this. The debate has been very heated for a while and isn't moving much, so let's lock this and try to move on for now.

Before we do, a few clarifications:

- We at Borussia Dortmund explicitly welcome fans from all backgrounds: Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Atheist, ... you're all welcome here.

- We would like to clarify that the term ""Islamismus"" used in this tweet, and in German media as a whole, clearly and deliberately denotes a single violent extremist ideology and specific political agenda - it does not target the religion of Islam as a whole. Similar terminology exists in the German language for other extremist ideologies, such as fascism, and the BVB twitter account has used it in the past.

- To the actual fascists and racists in this thread who are using this as an excuse to bash Islam, we see you and we would like to make it clear that you are not welcome here. As BVB supporters we are an inclusive, liberal community who share the values of our club, including a firm stance against all forms of racism and anti-semitism. If that doesn't suit you, kindly consider to get lost.

Be kind to each other, and try to work out any misunderstandings like this in a civil manner.

"I do believe that Dortmund should have probably written the tweet with more care. We sometimes forget that we have a worldwide fan base and words have different meanings in different cultures. In Germany, the word ""Islamist"" only refers to extremist Muslims ‚Äî¬†a distinction that is used both by authorities and religious groups. This all happens in the context that there is the perception in many Muslim communities that the West doen't treat them equally and that Muslims experience discrimination in Western countries.

This kind of leads to a vicious cycle: Muslims feel offened by the tweet and post reactionary content (Bayern Schadenfreude, Nazi comparisons). Non-Muslims are shocked by the reaction, and might become more Islamophobic because they are offended by accusations. Nobody is winning in the end.

Also, to the people saying muslims are ok with the killing, no they aren't. It goes completely against their religion, but they were provoked. Imagine you were with another dortmund supported and ran into a schalke fan. He insults your club and calls it names. Probably, you'd be upset and annoyed, and move on. However, your friend shouts ""For Football"" and murders him for it.

- Brandts been looking really solid last 3 games and as a sub he's great because he's so different and breaks patterns instantly.

- TOTO IS BACK &lt;3

- Haalands mentality. 

- 4 atb and how it makes Meunier less volatile. Even if he isnt the best.

* (Zenit coach Semak on why Dzyuba was subbed off: Physical strain due to fixture congestion. Also, Dzyuba didn't get access to finish, so they wanted a faster paced striker.)

* You called out to the team to play wider. Why couldn't they execute it? - Favre: It was planned beforehand. But Sancho and Reyna were too central. It was too easy for Zenit to defend. Yet we had 3 big chances in 1st half. But it would be difficult for any team. They defended with 9 players. We had to have patience. But it was difficult. They did well in the end.

* Second match without conceding a shot on goal. A few words on your central defenders (especially Akanji and Hummels)? - Favre: They were very good. Good with headers. They anticipated the depth. A counter can always happen, but they let them have no opportunity. It was important to stay patient.

* Bellingham didn't play much. Tactical decision or does he have a low? - Favre: He's only 17. His time will come. He has potential. But we also have a lot of depth in midfield. He's still young and needs to be patient.

* Russian journo: If you could pick one player from Zenit right now, which would you pick? - Favre: I saw 3 or 4 of their matches. They have a lot of good players. It's difficult to pick a name.

* Yesterday you lauded Zenit. Did they disappoint you today? - Favre: We controlled the game well. So they had virtually no chances. They played very well against Bruges. ... We earned our victory.

* Deciding goal came very late. How relieved were you to win? 1 Point after two matches would make things very complicated. - Favre: Of course, we knew that. We had to win.

"My takes: Overall I think we actually created some decent chances in the first half, the second half we where patient and we got a 50/50 call go our way. We have to remember we where playing a very deep lying opponent, and they condensed the midfield very well. We really struggled crossing into the box way to many balls where easy pickings for the zenit goal keeper, we also don't really have players strong in the air upfront. This makes it somewhat easy for teams to plan against us when sitting back deep; condense the middle of the pitch and force us out wide and invite crosses into the box. 

Brandt is amazing! I love Reus but after today I can't see him starting over Brandt alot considering both there forms. 

Meunier for some reason appears more comfortable in a back 4 then a back 3 despite him saying RWB is his preferred position. Whatever the reason he looked very good offensively and defensive in the back 4. 

Sancho looked very good to me today, probably one of his better matches besides Schalke on the weekend. 

Dahoud looks like great again seems to be our starting 8 now. 

Witsel puts the air out of the ball whenever he plays it seems. Kind of disappointing, would like to see Can play the 6, delany also looked great there.

"Either that was a shit performance from us up until the penalty or Zenit are unbelievable at defending. Frustrating performance and that goes for some of the players and as cliche as it is to say Favre as well but to a lesser extent. 

Witsel is too defensive in these types of games(it can be a good thing but games against clubs who sit back don't work for him in my opinion) and Reyna to me is not a LM or atleast he underperforms at LM. Reus was underperforming at CAM, Meunier had some poor mistakes in the first half but thankfully nothing came from them and he was alright afterwards, Akanji had his weekly Akanji moment but it would be harsh to criticize him on this match, he did well and Sancho took some time to get into the match but that could be attributed to how unbearably slow Zenit were but this could probably be a bad take from my part",gafg7ph,jjxb33,borussiadortmund,2020-10-29 06:14:04,EmSoLow,1

"Great win! I was worried it was going to be 0-0 bc zenit seemed to park the bus and really defended well the first hour of the game.  I would like to see Julian Brandt start also because he seems to be more in form than the start of the season and is part of the future of dortmund (not the ending past like reus,etc and i'm a huge reus fan).

Final note- Why can't dortmund run a 4-2-31 more often? I feel a 3 ATB formation is way too easy to get through. Why not play 4 at the back with guerrero who can also make offensive runs along with Can and Witsel as our 2 cdms. I think the 3 ATB is just kinda meh. Dortmund ran a 4-2-3-1 when they made champs league final many years back and lost to bayern.

"I have had major issues with Favre in the past but I would like to point out that Favre has adapted season to season. My problems from last season were lack of pressing and subbing and resting players. Things he has implemented this season.

Most of our poor results this season are due to lack of personnel, either by injury or by poor squad planning and have not been Favre's fault. He has been tactically bested once vs Lazio. I would hesitate to make a decision to fire him until something egregious happens i.e finish out of CL spots, finish 3rd in CL group, early exit from Pokal. 

The fact remains, the other coaches will need a squad catered to them, which means spending money in a COVID world and then have the uncertainty of how they perform. Favre is a known quantity, well liked by *his* squad. He is going up against the best Bayern since Pep with a squad with two wingers and a dozen midfielders. This decision shouldn't be made until we can see this season in hindsight.",gadscdj,jjmewh,borussiadortmund,2020-10-28 22:21:27,InexorableWyrd,22

"Derbysieger!!!!

Two derby wins in a row now. We'll all hope for a third to complete the double this season hehe.

It was a slow-ish start, but we still looked fairly in control. That's damn refreshing to see in this fixture these days. The Smurfs put up a wall, but we were clearly able to break it up in the second half after spending most of the first softening them up. 

I just wish Dahoud could have scored that long shot. That would have been sick. 

The goals we did get were awesome though. Rapha had a great shot saved (very slick corner routine) btw and Manu clinically snapped it up. Haaland having the composed presence of mind to drop into the middle with the ball and play a doppelpass with Sancho. It was an outstanding chip (Edit: Manu mentioned amusingly how Haaland usually goes full power on his shots; never seen him chip before haha) with his weak foot. And then a captain's goal from Hummels' magnetic head off the corner. Great stuff!

I'm very pleased and I think it's a great reaction to the mid-week disappointing result in the CL.

Looking forward to the next games! Zenit on Wednesday and the trip to Bielefeld on Saturday.

Who's the MOTM today? There's probably several options heh. üòÑ

Edit: Awww maaan, I was enjoying the post-match interview with Manu and Haaland on ESPN+, but they cut it off. Boooo.

Edit 2: Shout-out to B√ºrki having almost nothing to do on his return. Ha, that's always nice right. üëç

Don't mean to be that guy but Herne-West just look AWFUL. What did they have 3 shots in the whole game? Jesus. I can't help but think even during the game that we didn't have to do much to beat them.

Dunno what that deal was with Hummels and Haaland starting their runs from inside the goal at corners, but it's clear we've practiced them.

It's also hard to feel pumped up despite a great performance because Schalke are so unapologetically shit right now.

"Press conference with Favre and Zorc:

* Squad / injury status? - Favre: Can and Akanji back. Hazard too, but well... \[New info on Can from today: Covid, asymptomatic. Everyone else tested negative.\]
* Lucien, after matches you're usually very forgiving with the team. Are you maybe a bit annoyed this time? - ""No, not at all. We know it wasn't a good game from us. But we know we still have five games left in the Champions League. We want to qualify and we will accomplish that. - Once in a while this can happen.""
* You (and Kehl) criticized the performance on Tuesday. Can you hope for a different outcome in the derby? - Favre: Like I said, this can happen. We made too many mistakes, the goals we received, keeping possession... But the match against Sch\*lke will be totally different and we will manage to win it. - Zorc: The manager already said right after the match what we were missing- fighting spirit, willingness to run, emotion,... We made an exemplary effort to comply with distancing rules. On Saturday we need to see a reaction from the team.
* B√ºrki didn't play the last two matches. Why? Will he be back on Saturday? - Favre: I already explained that before. And we'll see for tomorrow.
   * Follow-up: Was it primarily an issue with illness or also performance? - Favre: He was ill/injured but he also had little play-time. And Marvin did very well.
* Does it feel like a derby, under the current conditions? - Zorc: It's still a derby. Like 300 people will be in the stadium, so it's not completely sold out &lt;laughs&gt; But we know about the significance of the match and of Sch\*lke's current situation. They will try everything to hinder us.
* Sch\*lke has a new manager. What impact did it have? - Favre: In Leipzig they played with a back five, 5-3-2. After that they changed. In a friendly against Paderborn they played 4-1-4-1 and same against Union Berlin. Use high pressing, high work rate.

"I already made a comment but I have to add one more thing.

WE DO NOT HAVE A STARTING XI!!!!!!!!!

As I watched another series of CL games I just thought well. This is exactly the team I expected. Same front row, same midfield, same defence like the past games.

But what is up with that in now his 3rd year and we still dont even have a formation yet. Like every match we have 2-3 changing players since 2+years now.... Remember the first few games under favre where everyone said you gonna be champs? Guess what, we used the exact same player and when one got injured we replaced him ONE BY ONE. Now if akanji is missing we pull can back from the 6 replacing him there with bellingham. If rapha misses we pull hazard back and use another formation thus making also changes on the other side of the field.

Get what im saying? Its been literally 2 + years and when sb would ask me whats ur starting xi, I would have to answer "" depends"" "" depends whether we play league, cl, dfb Pokal aaaaand depends on whether we play at home or not, depends if rapha is injured so we can 3cb in the back, depends on ... Depends on... "" 

Like fuck, look at bayern. Gnabry is injured and u replace one by one with coman. Boa is injured replace him with s√ºle. Done.

"[Press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI5v5LUKH6s) with Mats Hummels and Lucien Favre:

* How to stop Ciro Immobile? - Hummels: The way you stop every great striker: Don't give him chances. We know about his qualities. He goes for goals, has a brilliant volley, is determined. He's been ice cold in front of the goal for a few years now.
* Defensive issues: Will it be difficult to coordinate with a new constellation of defenders? - Hummels: It will be difficult, of course. You have automatisms with players you're used to, you know their mannerisms, know what to watch out for. Need to communicate a lot. Of course, it'll be on me - as the only regular CB, except maybe Pischu - to ""conduct"" the defense / give commands.
* More defensive stability in the past games, four clean sheets, fewer scoring opportunities for opponents. How did you accomplish this? - Hummels: In general, I'd say players have overall become more defensively-minded. Not as much unnecessary loss of possession and resulting counter attacks. It's only a small sample thus far, but I hope we'll continue like this.
* Update on Pischu? How much will you have to improvise? - Favre: Can't give an update on Pischu. Need to wait.
* (To Hummels) Lots of discussion about Boateng, M√ºller and you being needed in the NT. Do you pay attention? What's your take? - Hummels: I don't pay attention and I don't comment on it. Let's put it like that.
* Five players got rest in Hoffenheim. Will they be in the line up tomorrow? (Reus, Haaland) - Favre: I couldn't let Haaland play four matches in a row. So he needed a break and only played at the end. Reus was injured for 8 days after the Freiburg match. Need to be careful. \[as mentioned in the [Hoppenheim post match presser](https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/jcx3ew/post_game_threadtsg_1899_hoffenheim_buli_04/g94yqbx/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\]
* If Pischu is out as well, what options remain? Meunier as CB? - Favre: We'll see. Have to wait. We'll find a solution. - Reporter: Could Meunier theoretically play CB? - Favre: He only did that once, in Bruges.
* How do you handle the Corona situation personally? - Hummels: ""As a player, as a citizen - as stupid as that sounds - I try to be as careful as possible, and act like I should, to contribute my part ... I can't do more than that.""
* Mats, your manager is obviously worried about the congested schedule, but how do players perceive this? Are you keen on playing every three days? - Hummels: Players always say they want to play, but you have to consider the physical strain. This season especially, it's a difficult task for managers to keep their players healthy and at top performance.",g9cua9s,je1uou,borussiadortmund,2020-10-20 03:10:00,StandardProcess0,27

"Great to see we're playing a back 4 after so long, but I'd rather be playing Can to start as CB over Delaney bc Delaney needs more experience back there in league games first. I've waited so long to see a starting front 3 of Jadon Erling and Marco, it's going to be so exciting. People talk a lot about Immobile, and while I still think he's top 10 strikers of last season (and golden boot winner), Correa is also a very dangerous player with good pace and dribbling. The back 4 was necessary for today, but that means we'll have less full back contribution to the attack. I'm predicting 4-2 to Dortmund, with Erling Haaland starting off his UCL campaign with either a hat trick or a brace.

"Quick thoughts:

\-Don't ever want to see Brandt as a false 9 again. He's criminally out of his element up there.

\-Emre Can is quickly becoming our second best defender

\-Reyna and Passlack are being asked to do way too much. Both are good players but Idk why Reus didn't start this match. At some point it should be clear that we can't rely on these guys to have + performances every week with more talented/established players on the bench.

"Thoughts on the game:

Overall performance: Despite the super narrow score line, I feel we played pretty well for a squad where a good quarter of the essential positions were injured. Dortmund showed just how versatile its players were and that they can perform well in any circumstance, just what we need to compete with Bayern. We were a little sloppy in the first 15 minutes (possibly due to the pitch), but we got back into our rhythm fine. Hoffenheim proved they aren't Kramaric FC even if they lost, because they looked very deadly on the wing breaks.

&amp;#x200B;

Top Performers: 

\- Can: My man of the match. What a player. Still can't believe Juventus let him go, they need him desperately. He still continues to prove he is both a good central midfielder as well as a top quality center back. The amount of times he saved the team during the fast breaks, wow. He still performs needless dribbles from the back, but we saw a little less pf that today. 10/10 

\- Delaney: I never really saw a place for Delaney in the first XI when the season started, but I have a feeling we can pull of a Can and slide him into CB if we get more injuries. I'm not sure he ever played as a center back, but he looked so natural in there. Some sticky situations where he held the ball a little too long and put the team in danger of losing possession, but he still out did himself way out of position. 9/10

\- Hitz: I still stand by the opinion that Hitz should be our number 1. He was so good in the tight pressing atmosphere created by Hoffenheim, and his reactions and concentration exceeded what Burki had put into the squad in his last 8-9 games. 8/10 

\- Guerriero: In 15 minutes Guerriero showed he is one of the best left backs in the game. I'm afraid City or Juventus might try to steal him soon so we better be as stubborn with them as we were with United. Great defensive awareness, and a very natural attacking tendency. 7/10

\- Haaland: What is it now, 2 assists in a row? That's 6 goal involvements in 4 games for him. What a beast. He did miss 2 good chances, but he looked a little out of his element due to his slight knock after the first goal, and we have to remember he was essentially carrying Norway in international duty. 7/10

\- Reus: Super Sub. Came on. Scored. Won. 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

Underwhelming performers:

\- Dahoud: I might be in the minority here, but the 2 games Mo started this season (Bayern and Hoffenheim), I felt he was the reason we didn't get into a strong start early in the games. His energy and drive is commendable, and I love his determination, but he seems so sloppy with the ball, like he's trying to play for himself. 3/10

\- Brandt: I can't blame him, he was forced out of a position he doesn't play in naturally. He can only work his magic when there is a player in front of him waiting for his supply. Not a bad attempt, but I saw him fall back way too far and essentially leave Reyna and Sancho as a 2 man striker duo. It shouldn't be that hard to stay in position. 5/10

&amp;#x200B;

Favre's Tactics: For once, Favre's weird decision making is understandable. We lack depth in defense, and with all the injuries we have, he had no choice but to play 2 CM's as CB's. Brandt playing as striker was also a understandable choice as Haaland was resting, but I would have put Sancho there as False 9 instead. Other than that, he made the correct changes at the right times, made sure the team kept an attacking mentality and instructed them to control the midfield, and allowed some players to be rested for the UCL game. Not a bad game for him. 7/10",g94gybe,jcx3ew,borussiadortmund,2020-10-18 01:59:30,ahmed_a20,12

* What consequences should the recent Covid infections have for NT breaks? - If we talk about this, it'll take a while. Hoffenheim isn't the only club. There will be more. It's not good to travel right now.
* You recently stated ""Haaland always wants to play."" How did react to being put on the bench today? - We need to be reasonable. He played 120min / 80min / 87min with the national team within 8/9 days. Need to have an eye on the CL.
* Three clean sheets in a row. What are the main factors contributing to more defensive stability? - Every player needs to defend. Not just 8 or 9. All need to work together.
* Enough squad depth for the upcoming weeks? - (Yes, for pretty much all positions except CB)",g94yqbx,jcx3ew,borussiadortmund,2020-10-18 04:28:27,StandardProcess0,8

We got away with the cookie jar on this one.

Hello guys. I am a Dortmund fan from Nepal. It's so rare to find a bundesliga watcher in my country let alone a Dortmund fan. All my friends are premier league fans so I couldn't discuss bundesliga with anyone. But then I found out about Reddit and here I see so many Dortmund fans discussing Dortmund things. I am so happy that I can finally discuss about my favorite club with so many people now ( I have already posted 2 3 comments last week though). Looking forward to it üôÇ,g87lo8v,j7uhnx,borussiadortmund,2020-10-09 20:41:25,rashikbvb,40

Unlucky that we couldn't take those two big chances for Haaland and Meunier though. We came close.

I had some internet issues while trying to watch this game and had to take a phone call around the time Haaland scored, so I can't say too much more than that.

"1st half wasn't great but I thought Favre made an excellent switch at half time. He moves Reus further up and brought Brandt a little deeper, pretty much into a 5-3-2. This allowed Reus to drop in to get the ball, and also gave us an extra body in midfield with Brandt. I really think this should be the plan moving forward, with a 3 man midfield. I think a strength of this squad that gets overlooked is the versatility. We have guys that can play out wide and in the middle, both forward and deep in the middle. Some combination of Witsel, Delaney, Brandt, Bellingham, Mo, and maybe even Rapha to rotate in the midfield three. Then depending on who we face we can adjust to play more centrally or more on the wings. 

Either way it was a good fight from us and seeing Bayern concede this much in 2 games has to be encouraging for us going forward, but obviously there are still things to work out and clean up.

"While it hurt in the moment, coming out of this feeling pretty good a few hours later.

* From both this and Augsburg, we've identified a key weakness - counterattacks - which is a much more specific defensive weakness you can train against.

* We scored 2 at the Allianz. Been a while since we scored even 1.
* Finishing &amp; calm in front of goal would have gotten us more like 4. We can settle in more to this season and build the kids' confidence.
* That weirdass Haaland &gt; Reinier  sub will look like Haaland &gt; Moukoko come November
* Did this all with a rotated midfield
* Brandt gets a goal
* Passlack again puts in decent work
* Losing to Bayern in a Safe Space with no points dropped, two goals scored, and and some learnable lessons makes this a decent morale-boosting springboard

I'm frustrated ut 1) I wasn't offending anyone (besides of favre obviously) and 2) I'm perfectly sane now, just telling some logical conclusion about our mentality and way of playing, which is and have been poor for some time now.

I'm not saying I want to win the Supercut, but you've seen how Bayern players left the field? And ours? Do you really think it's irrelevant to try to win this match?

It's an extremely disappointing result. We ran into their wall and the first half could have fit in with our form around this time 3 years ago. Sancho had a shocker and we tried to pass through the block too much with no one able or willing to drive to the touchline.

Things looked brighter when Reyna and Moukoko came on as they were both involved in the lone goal, but it felt like we had so little time to break through at that point, considering the subs all happened after we conceded the second.

This is not what you want to see with two tough games against Lazio and Frankfurt coming up next week.

MOTM would probably be either Emre Can or Manuel Akanji for me. 

Sancho has got to do better though. We can only hope he turns it around again like he did after the winter dip in form he had last year.

Edit: P.S. It's really frustrating that both of their goals were nearly identical and both flicked on by the man we loaned out, Marius Wolf. üòì",gdvzu5n,k2qjzk,borussiadortmund,2020-11-29 00:34:51,Nextgen101,8

"Problem that this game has shown us, like dozens of times times before is that this team doesn't learn. It's not a coincidence we keep losing against low-positioned teams in pretty much the same way.

Favre defenders need to realize one thing. Are we a horrible team?  Is Favre a horrible coach? No and no. Should we play better against teams that park the bus, should we stop conceding from corners ... over and over and over and over again.  Yes and yes.

I wouldn't mind that much being constantly second or worse in the league, yeah I know the Bayern is just too damn good. But it would be much more easier to for me to accept being forever behind Bayern if we lost the games in a different way. Not ALWAYS in literally the same way. (I'm only talking about Bundesliga now). 

I want to see Dortmund that doesn't drop points against teams close to relegation, I want to see Dortmund finally LEARN something, improve and I want to see Dortmund that has enough pride that when we play against Bayern we don't let Lewandowski and Kimmich humiliate us. A team that's ready to play dirty in those games, make many fouls, a team that wants to FINALLY win. It's been almost a decade that Bayern keeps winning the league. I want to see a team willing to change that.

Favre had more than enough time to do something like that but obviously isn't successful. I hope we will have a new coach next season. I just honestly want to see something different from this team, I'm tired of games like this.",gdw28cq,k2qjzk,borussiadortmund,2020-11-29 00:50:25,duNksteN,2

He really has to find consistency - you can't afford to be misplacing or underhitting 2-yard passes at this level. 

In attack, Haaland looked mortal, Marco looked far from his best until the last 10 minutes, and Sancho had one of his worst games of the season. On the bright side, though, the complexion of the game changed drastically once we brought on the subs. Toto, Gio and Moukoko all showing their qualities, and I think with a bit more time and luck, we could've scored the equalizer.

"Absolute dominant performance over 90 minutes. Big three points. Haaland clinical as usual. Clean sheet. Favre‚Äôs tactics on points. Crazy that we don‚Äôt have a single injury in the team rights now. Shoutout to the medical staff!

Only negative: no Moukoko, but I‚Äôll take Passlack and Morey subs as well.

Even one draw out of the next two CL games should be (likely) sufficient to put us into the final 16. 

MOTM Sancho: Killer work rate, assist, and great free kick. Great to have him back in prime shape.

Mood is stellar off and on the pitch. Seems like Favre is having the time of his life. Favorite moment: Kehl taking the piss of Haaland for ‚Äúonly‚Äù scoring two goals today.",gdhlnin,k0emy3,borussiadortmund,2020-11-25 05:51:39,santadani,25

"We got most of our business taken care of in the first half and sealed the deal fairly comfortably in the second. It was pretty similar to our last meeting (Edit: Haaland even scored another brace hehe) with Brugge a few weeks ago.

A solid performance with very few scares. I can't ask for much more than that. I had to do some multitasking today, so a simple and clean result was really nice. Lazio also wrapped up a win against Zenit, so we're holding out above them by a point. It seems like next week's match against Lazio will end up being the kingmaker for our group.

And now we have Cologne up next on the weekend.

Haaland has to be MOTM again, but we had good performances throughout the midfield to keep Brugge in check when we were out of possession. It was cool to see Sancho getting back amongst the goals too! üëç",gdhlmcb,k0emy3,borussiadortmund,2020-11-25 05:51:23,Nextgen101,10

Kidding aside, we started off really rusty while Hertha hit the ground running with high intensity and then rewarded themselves with the 1-0 out of nowhere (though they also hade the better chances up to that point).

But even though they were able to play more defensively following the lead, our players managed to get into the game better and better to the point where Hertha wasn't able to deny us quality chances.

At the end of the day Haaland easily won motm by simply not putting a single foot wrong while Hummels, Can and especially Akanji were class from the beginning. The rest started off shaky but thankfully not for long.

"Presser with Favre and Zorc:

* Injury / squad status? - Favre: Good news - No new injuries. But Zagadou can't play yet, it's too early.

* Moukoko's 16th birthday. Everyone's excited for his first match. How is he doing in the first team? 

	* Favre: We'll see today [Friday] after training if he'll fly with the team. As a player he has fantastic potential. He's very good, in the first team too. It's fun to train with him.
	* Zorc: He's had an invigorating effect on the team and in training. Nevertheless I want to point out that what's happening in the media with regards to the boy, is going too far. He only just turned 16. He'll surely be an important part of Dortmund's future. But what I'm experiencing right now, every day, I don't like it. It creates too much pressure. We should all take our foot off the gas pedal and calm down a bit.

* Pro and con for taking Moukoko to Berlin? - Favre: He's developing well, but we have a lot of players/quality upfront. We'll see.‚Ñ¢

* Emre Can only played as CB in the 3atb system. Right now you're playing 4atb. Where do you see him playing? - Favre: He can play in multiple positions. Defense and midfield. We didn't play him as CB in the 4atb and I've never seen him in that position. So I can't say.

* Hertha Berlin? - Favre: &lt;obligatory statement that this opponent will be a challenge&gt;

* There was a lot of talk about Haaland having to go into quarantine. Can you go into detail about that? - Zorc: He didn't have contact to the players who got tested positive (several players now tested positive, but had negative results until after the last Norway training), we coordinated with the public health office in Dortmund. On top of that we did 4 tests in 7 days, all of which turned out negative. We also isolated him in the first few days.

* How to handle the national matches? Were you annoyed? - Zorc: [...] We've been in a bubble for 7 months and try to uphold the strict guidelines implemented by the DFL. Evidently it's the case that certain other leagues aren't handling it as professionally. It causes issues when all these players join up in the NT.

* Debacle of the German NT. What are your thoughts? - Zorc: I watched the match and followed the discussion. But that's, thankfully, not my problem.

* Reyna's contract extension is great for the club. He has a lot of potential, good in multiple positions.

* Zagadou will be back before Christmas.

* Does Reyna's contract have a release clause? - Zorc: You already know that we don't comment on that... but you can assume that he'll play for us for a long time. &lt;smiles&gt;

* To Favre: Watzke announced that you will soon be in talks about your future in Dortmund. Can you imagine extending with BVB? - Favre: No comment.

* Is 4atb the perfect formation, until Zagadou is back? - Favre: So many teams now play 3atb, so many players are used to it. But we did well with 4-2-3-1. We always have two options.",gd2ka04,jxtbcb,borussiadortmund,2020-11-22 00:04:54,StandardProcess0,9

"I think we can all agree that Favre's time at Dortmund has been, and probably  will continue to be, well spent. You can't really argue with the results, 2nd place in the league and looking like a serious competitor both years to Bayern is no easy task. I know Watzke knows an infinite more about the situation than any of us, but I think he's missing the point on why we don't want Favre going forward. Favre will give us all of the 2-4 finishes in the world, but he will never improve the team enough to fulfill its potential. The team definitely needs a brilliant tactician, which suits Favre, but I think the team is in dire need of a motivator, a guy who can be a real hard ass.

"Watzke backing up his current coach during the season. No idea why so many are freaking out, it's really not that controversial and definitely not spectacular.

Whether we'll extend is a whole other question, and will be highly dependent on this season. And it's not only the club who has to decide, but Favre as well. This is the most high-pressure job he has ever had, and he has the means and the age where retirement could be a real option.

It's also a question whether he'd be up for another short-term contract. If we can't find anyone we like more in 2021, guys like Rose or ten Hag have contracts expiring in 2022. But would Favre be cool to act as a stop gap? We could be heading into another 2018-Nagelsmann situation.",gcuryf7,jx5pvc,borussiadortmund,2020-11-20 02:34:24,Sarrazin,13

"I think fans are more agitated about how we fuck up potential championships. We can't blame it on systematic and targeted transfers like after the double. And we can't blame Uberbayern anymore. They were just unbeatable between 15 and 17.

That's how the post started. But I've done a bit if brush up. Bayern ate still too uber. In 2014 or so I reviewed every championship since the start and in 52 laps, some 49 were won by anyone getting 69 or more points. Since then (S13/14) Bayern scored points: 90(71BVB), 79,  88 (78BVB) , 82, 84, 78 ( 76BVB), 82
WHILE no runner up not once even cracked 70, except for us those three times.

Now I'm among many that call bullshit on the 18/19 season for omitting two penalties in our duel with them, but thems the facts. They just outpace everything and anything. I wouldn't be surprised if they were doping like shit, given how they often don't seem to be one pace slower 90 minutes and countless sprints and tackles into the game than they were when they began

"Idea: We should try a [4-4-2](https://i.imgur.com/T5Bk9s8.png). 

Now this could be a slight modification of the 4-2-3-1 but I've seen a noticable difference whenever our wingers track back and our midfield and defense forms a clear 4-4 shape in two banks of four. When we play the ""normal"" 4-2-3-1 our wingers stay forward a lot more and don't track back, and we play a lot higher. 

The shape I'm talking about happened in the last game vs Bayern and also in the home game against Atletico which we won 4-0. In my opinion, that 4-0 is the best game we've played under Favre. 

In this formation we play a solid 4-4-2 without the ball, and a 2-4-4 with the ball. Wingers bomb forward and either cut inside or stay wide, fullbacks support the midfield and one of the strikers poaches for space (perfect for Haaland) and the other stays deeper and tries to create more and arrives late in the box (perfect for Reus). This is also the formation Favre employed when he was at Gladbach and the one in which Reus thrived. 

With this formation we can ensure defensive stability while also scoring lots. This is also the most effective formation should we press a intensely.

"We should get some news about contract extensions in the coming months.

In 2021 the most relevant expiring contracts are Passlack and Hitz. If they are happy with their current situation, I'd definitely extend both.

2022 we'll have Zagadou, Akanji, Hummels, Witsel, Delaney, Dahoud. So a lot of potential to mix it up in central defense and midfield.

I'm curious how things will go. Zagadou and Akanji probably depend on how they are doing. The decision with the older guys will probably wait until 2021 to see how they hold up. Dahoud and Delaney will probably depend on how happy they'll be with their playing time this year.

Generally, during Corona we'll look to save wherever possible, but there's also not much room to sign new players. Then there's of course the whole coaching question, though I believe most personnel decisions will be made largely independent of who will manage us in 2021.

American fan here. I traveled to Germany in 2006 to visit a German friend in Muenster. First time in the country and he took me to a USA v Germany friendly in Dortmund in the lead up to the World Cup. I had never been in an atmosphere like that and I was in awe. I started following Dortmund after that game and fell in love with the club. Mostly because of Klopp but also because of how they play their youth and its an exciting brand of soccer.

Ah, it's so difficult to keep up with their breakneck speed of play in both attack and defense. Man, it's so crazy, it feels like FIFA scripting at times.

I don't know what else to say honestly. I can only hope we can keep it close again when the time comes for the trip to Munich.

MOTM for me is B√ºrki, but there's possibly an honorable mention or two. Sancho has got to get out of whatever funk he's in though.

It's still not a totally ruined day for me personally, but it could have been a lot better.... üòî

Time for an international break. We'll circle back for a Hertha away game in a couple weeks.",gbhcgks,jpwjz5,borussiadortmund,2020-11-08 03:32:53,Nextgen101,3

"Stings, but given that the league is decided after 34 games, not 1, I thought that was a reassuringly brilliant performance against the toughest opposition any team in the world can have right now. Poor from Sancho and not Reyna's best but a monstrous shift put in by Haaland, Reus is back on the scoresheet, and Guerreiro continues to be the most underrated passer in the world.

"Sad, honestly a really good match by us. Lacked the bit of coolness in front of goal, we had some extremly good chances which honestly shouldve gave us at least a point from this match.

Happy with pretty much every performance, Delaney didnt have the best day but Witsel made up for it, Bellingham also was great after coming on. The match of course hurts but it shouldnt discourage anyone from the dream of a title. Everything is possible and we are still in great form.

"Referee - fantastic. VAR - on point. Haaland - played his heart out. Jude - desire and fight. Hazard - gave us hope. Muenier - imo played on point today apart from some decisions. Witsel - his composure helps us in midfield. Hummels - rash decisions. Akanji - kept lewandowski at bay. Reus - sit down, you need to get your shit together. Reyna - take a break on the bench.

Haaland is the man of the match for me, the way he twists his body to get his shots off and his speed is quite impressive! Also, I have to say that Meunier did play well today and showed heart. I don't usually like him and I still think he made some mistakes but his performance was really good compared to others who really did not shine that brightly this match.",gbhcwl3,jpwjz5,borussiadortmund,2020-11-08 03:35:39,[deleted],2

"Anxious slash excited for the match on Saturday. We're on 10-0 on the last matches but these numbers may seem deceiving; we are defensively stable (consider gin the return of Hummels to his spot) but our offensive seems pointless a lot of the time (at least one half each game where we didn't score and sometimes didn't even looked close on scoring). I'm worried because I don't think any defensive stability can hold Bayern's offence, they are simply on fire and Lewy... well that fucker always scores against us. Attacking wise, I think we need good shots, Haaland is the obvious one but I need to see Hazard, Reus and Rapha doing their job as well. I don't think Brandt suits this game, I'm not into what I'm seeing from him on the pitch, and Sancho worries me af, he's on a shit phase and every damn Bayern game since the 3-2 he looked appalled, without motivation. Wish he proves me wrong this weekend.",gb95z9z,jmlawq,borussiadortmund,2020-11-06 02:33:01,funky_motorik,3

"It seems as if Favre found a matchplan, that works against small teams. Total control in the first half, at expense of having that total punch, waiting until there‚Äôs enough room at around 60‚Äô.

I mean if you don‚Äôt concede a goal you can‚Äôt lose and conceding early against a team like that is the worst thing that can happen. 

Winning against a team with 6 in the back is never going to be an easy run, but why risk to much early on, if you‚Äôve got more class going the distance.

It's unusual, but still pretty cool to see Hummels get a brace. It made up for the other missed chances and that's definitely fine by me. Honestly can't find too much else to say about it.

we were defensively stable, midfield had some good pressing play and we played REALLY high compared to before. passes seemed to be more sharped, changing sides felt like it was quicker too. 


the rest was literally energy-saving standby mode. BS wasn't dangerous at all - only that one off the bar - and was basically non-existent.

imo Brandt is trying to be too classy and gentle due to which he tends to take that extra second to find the pass.

"I know other people on this sub have mentioned this, but we need someone who give us width. Us relying on full backs to attack and give us width leaves us vulnerable to counters and might I add: 

While Rapha is the best LB in the world, he tends to drift in to playmake. Meunier, Morey are not fast enough to give width and Schulz is not smart enough. Thus, our midfield is compact. Our opponents also concentrate on the midfield and a majority of our forward passes get cut off.

Now people will say we have Reyna, Sancho, Reus, Hazard and they all give us width and to them I say that's horseshit. All of them try to cut in and get in the middle. Plus barring Sancho (who doesn't like running as much anymore) and Hazard they are not pacy. One of the reasons why Toto's presence was so missed during his injury was his capability to give us width.

Essentially what I'm trying to say here is poor squad planning is another problem for this squad, and we should target some wingers next season.",ggwwwfh,khd3sm,borussiadortmund,2020-12-25 01:24:18,InexorableWyrd,2

"In Terzic's first game against Bremen they did fine, but to be honest I think our main problem this season is that Witsel and Reus just don't perform as well as they could/should.

I think overall Reus is basically our best player and he should go ahead as the leader of the team, but I feel like he just doesn't put in the effort needed to show his full ability. He barely finds any spaces and the main reason for that is that he doesn't work hard enough to create/find any spaces. As a 10 he should be everywhere: Dropping back when we have trouble getting to the final third, dropping between the defenders to play 1-2s and sprint behind the defenders to open up holes and to create chances for through balls. But he doesn't do this enough. 

I think Witsel is at its best in a Busquets-style role of filling gaps as the 6 in a 3 man midfield. His strengths are closing spaces and slowing down counters when the opposition has the numbers. Also, he is great at keeping the ball when pressed. But he just isn't nearly as strong going forward and starting attacks/counters as for example Brandt. 

Another point I don't really get is why Brandt almost never gets to play on his strongest position. He has had his strongest games and we dominated so many games where he started as CM. His ability to speed up play, to push forward, to create superior numbers and to force dangerous situations is unmatched in our squad and I believe this is a main thing we need to boost our attack. His offensive focus might create defensive problems, but I think Delaney is ideal to make up for that.

I really want to see this lineup again, we should have a very strong offense with this:

Haaland/Moukoko (as long as Haaland is out)

Reyna/Hazard - Reus - Sancho

Delaney - Brandt

Guerreiro - Hummels - Akanji - x (personally, I'd like to see more of Passlack, but we have 3 different RBs with different strengths)

"The set piece defending is obviously ridiculous, but its the attack that worries me. We simply don't look like we are going to score. Our major offensive threats are either injured (Haaaland, Thorgan) or experiencing major drops in form (Sancho, Reus and Brandt). This to me is the bigger problem. Teams know that we are unlikely to punish them for a high line so they are more aggressive, get into better positions, get more set pieces and force more errors.

I don't want to blame anyone player for this, because that it incredibly simplistic. Its a combined lack of product. If we can address this and improve our output just a bit, I think we will be fine.",gghtkyh,kgqext,borussiadortmund,2020-12-21 00:59:49,me_meh_me,9

But considering Haaland was the only player (I saw) thank Favre after he was sacked, and taking into consideration what Reus said after last match, clearly there were problems in the locker room that will take time to be resolved. It's only been a week, we've been relying on a bunch over overworked youngsters, and we're giving players like Witsel and Meunier too many passes after poor performances.",ggarhsz,kfu5pq,borussiadortmund,2020-12-19 05:51:20,poetryjo,56

"I don't get how you can pt this on all players. 

First of all, isn't the manager's job to deal with the emotions of each member, to build the team's spirit and to pu them on the right mindset? When did Favre fulfilled this job? We played good and had some good sequences, but we already seen this happen to this squad. We got 5,6,7 new starters, and the same feeling persists. Now he's gone for a week and the players should be different? They're living this environment for years now.

And furthermore, not all players are to blame for this. You can't play football alone, but some really try. Hummels and Haaland mainly, have the energy and constantly deliver. Bellingham, Reyna and Moukoko always look more active and willing than their older brothers; they are kids, they shouldn't take the responsibility, but sometimes they do (and it's not enough).

Reus' been a problem, though. He doesn't have the captain vibes, unfortunately, and it's even worse when he's not delivering much. Sancho's to blame also, he's young but so is Haaland, and he's shown football of a world star. You don't need to be awesome every match, but at least try to be average.

"Alright so some observations I have.

Akanji had some poor mistakes in the first half which could have easily gone in if a more competent team were playing but it's whatever. Outside of that, can't really critique him and I'm not sure whether he was at fault for the second goal or somebody else

A midfield partnership of Can and Witsel is shit and should never be seen in a starting 11 ever again. We need somebody else there and hopefully this partnership was just because of our players playing 3 games in 7 days and needed rest. The winter break will be a blessing

Sancho was off again, had a great opportunity early on and since then he kept on losing the ball constantly. This is not the Sancho of last season obviously, this Sancho either is ready to leave or lockdown has managed to affect his mental health, negatively impacting how he plays or is it because Hakimi isn't there because I honest to God don't know. I wanted Dortmund to sign a winger in the window to give our right side some flexibility without forcing Brandt there but now it might be to fill in for Sancho's unbelievably bad form

Two corner goals, two players being shit at marking(Reyna and it was either Can/Akanji or Hummels for the other one). Can't really say anything other than get better at corners but that's easier said than done

And for my final negative point, CAN, STOP GOING FOR THESE DIPSHIT LONG SHOTS",ggaq2id,kftz9i,borussiadortmund,2020-12-19 05:40:07,EmSoLow,4

"The only positives I can think of are Moukoko scoring and Can playing really well. It was overall really sloppy from us. Losing balls in questionable positions, weak set piece defending, and little chance creation in the final third.

~~Apart from the Moukoko assist,~~ Reus was completely invisible the whole game. Sancho was horrible except for maybe 2 or 3 good passes. He had an opportunity to score early on from the Moukoko pass but squandered it. The coach can't be the only problem in a team. Obviously we are going to play bad if 2 starting attackers are completely out of form. They need to pick it up from here because there will be no improvement if our striker, Reyna, and Guerreiro are our only attacking threats.

I thought our defending was good except for the set pieces. Hummels, Can, and Akanji won some impressive duels. Burki was on the good side too.

This is the second time the Witsel and Can partnership didn't work. I don't think they played bad per say (I was really happy with Can), but the combination of their playing styles limits us going forward.

As of rn, there has been 0 change from Favre. Even in the Bremen game, I could easily have seen a performance like that under Favre. Especially in the early stages of the season. I'm not totally blaming Terzic since he just started, but we need to see improvements by early 2021.

"Press-conference with Michael Zorc and Edin Terzic:

* To Terzic: After the victory in Bremen you said that you had to force it. What did you work on to make it easier against Union Berlin? - Terzic: We sat down yesterday and talked about the match, the positive and not so positive. We came to the conclusion that it will serve as a benchmark for how much commitment we will have to show on the pitch. We had an opportunity to win this match much easier. Didn't work. But we were happy that we defended the win. We also showed some scenes where we saw potential for short-term improvement and hope to put that into practice vs Berlin.

* You had some mixed results vs Berlin. What to improve? - Terzic: You're right. They showed how much energy they have. Usually the 2nd year in the Bundesliga is more difficult than the 1st- at least that's what people say. But it doesn't show with Union. They're very stable, very bold, made some good transfers. We need to prepared for that.

* One of the difficulties in the past weeks was a lack of communication on the pitch. We noticed, due to the ghost matches, that Dortmund was one of the quiet teams. How to change that? - Terzic: As the training staff, if we want to see the maximum from them, we have to set an example of giving the maximum. That involves everyone. It's important to me that players don't just recall instructions, but also comprehend them. If you understand things it's easier to put them into practice. We all have to take responsibility and help each other when we realize that things are amiss.

* Squad / injury status? - Terzic: Yesterday was regeneration for players who played 45min+ but we'll have another session after this. Then we'll look into the personnel situation. We hope everyone's okay and that Delaney / Meunier will be available.

* Morey made several appearances. How do you rate him? - Terzic: We're happy to have him. We can't forget that he's one of the younger players and left his home country to play with us. He's very perceptive and always looking to improve himself. In his apps he did very well. He has great technical abilities, stays calm under pressure and in tight spaces, good with the left and the right foot. Played in that position for the first time against Leipzig and looked very confident.

* How to bring Reus and Sancho back to their best form? - Terzic: They're smart enough to know that they're not giving optimal performances. The penny almost dropped for Jadon against Bremen, but it was offside. Reus had 3 or 4 good chances as well. I think they showed a reaction on Tuesday and were very dangerous in front of the goal. Sometimes the difference is in small details, like going into the run with your first touch instead of stopping the ball, to pick up speed and avoid a 2v1 situation- and the players need to recall these nuances. But it's not just individual things. They also need someone available for the quick one-two passing, or someone to make a deep run. But overall they know they are great players and we'll help them step-by-step to get back on top.

* &lt;Another question on when Reus will be back in peak form&gt;

	* Terzic: I have a new role in the club, but the job description didn't say anything about being clairvoyant.
	* (Zorc: We didn't write that in?)
	* Terzic: Sometimes it's easy and it only takes a single play for the penny to drop. Sometimes it takes a bit longer. He showed a great performance against Bremen, and I'm sure it won't take too long.

* As mentioned sometimes the team is too quiet, maybe a little too timid. Could Emre Can do something to change that? - Terzic: Although we wanted to look at the win in Bremen as a team effort and not focus too much on single performances, I couldn't help but laud Emre in front of the whole team. Emre showed that intensity before the match, during warm-up and throughout the whole game and it's very important. It's essential that we all feel responsible for motivating ourselves and each other, and Emre did that really well.

* Players can go home over the holidays, because NRW doesn't have quarantine requirements

* Zorc liked the performance against Bremen

* It's important that the manager emphasizes the strengths of his own players, instead of the opponent's, Zorc says after a leading question.",gg5vft5,keyto1,borussiadortmund,2020-12-18 02:00:24,StandardProcess0,53

"The possible lineup is nice because it puts Brandt in his favorite position. We haven't seen that at all this season. I feel like Brandt's performances are going to pick up drastically under Terzic.

I'm also REALLY worried about Hummels. I've been saying for weeks he needs to be rested for a matchday. He has the most minutes in the squad while also being the 3rd oldest in the squad. For the last like 3 games he had to get subbed on because of an injury scare. We need to give him a break we can't keep gambling on his fitness because he's too crucial to lose to a long term injury. He should DEFINITELY be rested in the DFB Pokal game. For this game maybe he should start but we should seriously look to sub him out if everything looks good by the second half.

Also this is going to be a tough game. Union is the only top 6 team we have played this season barring Bayern. This is a big test.",gg7d08y,keyto1,borussiadortmund,2020-12-18 09:26:23,Trojan_Man68,4

"

Positives:

- Reus was far better today than previously. Still not 100% but happy with what I saw. Then again, he played his proper position.

- Bellingham still a delight to see. His age shows at times but expected.

- Even if he's(Moukoko) way too erratic with the ball and such, we function better with a proper 9s movement. The false 9 games are really poor in creativity.

- Guerreiro. God. 

- Brandt was a really fresh addition.

- Reyna. Super god this season so far.

- A must win in a really tough transitional period with Terzic etc.

- I really enjoy Morey tbh. 

Negatives:

- Sancho legit doesnt have feet anymore. His clinical finishing, gone. Passing, gone. Dribbling, worse but still there. 

- Hummels might be injured, again....

- Still WAAY too much ball losses.

"Some brief notes as I have to head out now.

Great win. I'd take any win against teams like Bremen who have caused us problems in the past. 

Reus was wonderful, and Morey, he was as bloody brilliant tonight.

I am sad panda over Hummels.

Dafuq has happened to Sancho? It is surreal. I don't believe he has downed tools, rather this is some Monstar shit going on.",gfyq6m4,kdux0k,borussiadortmund,2020-12-16 05:29:13,Nuri__Sahin,26
"Now I don't wanna hear anything bad about Moukoko, he's still 16, its normal that things dont go his way instantly. 

THAT SAID


with the amount of chances we created, with Haaland this game isn't even remotely close. Honestly much better than the score suggests and I never really doubted we'd win.

Witsel, Mats, and **REUS** much better, stepping up as the veterans should and leading by example. Solid return from Bellingham. Sancho still a bit off but his heart's in the right place (unlike his feet) and I expect him to hit the ground running again soon. Reyna has the potential to be the US's best ever player, no, I am not joking. Guerreiro is a top 5/3/1 LB/LWB/LM itw. Akanji really made up for the error in their goal by anticipating Pavlenka. Morey had a good few runs/crosses that left me hyped for his future. Brandt...

MotM either Reyna or Reus, personally I'm giving it to Reus because I spent the better part of 3 days shitting on him and he repaid all his dues back in world class fashion.

"I really like Morey‚Äôs tanacity and energy, but he needs to give the ball away a little less. 

Reus ran a lot and was involved much more today, but I still think he isn‚Äôt quite as clinical as his top form self at the moment. 

Sancho is certainly putting in effort and tracking back at times, but he is still struggling to find top form. I just want it to click for him again. 

Personally, I don‚Äôt think Akanji‚Äôs ceiling is much higher. He is a good player, but he makes some horrible decisions with passes at times. Every once in a while he will ping a beautiful ball forward, but he plays too many dangerous central passes that are intercepted. I don‚Äôt know if I see him really developing the mental part of his game much further than where it is now. 

Moukoko had like 4 decent opportunities. He just needs one to get off the mark and get some of the confidence in and nerves out. It shows he is at least getting into some decent positions. Now he just needs to put one away.",gfyr7wl,kdux0k,borussiadortmund,2020-12-16 05:37:34,biggieBpimpin,15

"REUS‚ù§Ô∏èMy fucking captain.

Say one more time that he isn't fit to be captain, I double  dare you. he was absolutely brilliant. Chasing the ball, pressing, laying down sitters which we missed. 

We created so much and could've easily scored 4 or 5. Offensively we improved so much, a lot more directness and pressure. 

Defensively, we still make the same mistakes mostly, but the added workrate and a deeper defense helps. Risky passes in trying to ""play out from the back"" are still giving me heart attacks. Morey had a great game, so did Hummels. Hopefully the injury isn't serious.

Early days but a lot of positive stuff, and I'll take the 3 points

Man Moukoko was just one step away for every goal opportunity. His positioning and link up is great and if he scored every time this would have been an incredible game.

"Some thoughts:

* Pressing was much better and more vertical passing into the channels. There were a number of moments where the pass came before the player receiving it expected it and had to sprint to keep it in. Shows that there is an emphasis on not sitting on the ball waiting for your teammates to make something happen. As a whole more direct and energetic with their movement in the early stages of the match which faded after 20 or so minutes. It will take time for them to play with a quicker internal rhythm over the course of  a match.

&amp;#x200B;

* You can tell who the patient players are: Reyna, Witsel, Sancho are the obvious ones. This is not a slight against them but you can tell they're still waiting for players to make stuff happen in front of them. Sancho more than the others looked to be trying to speed his game up a bit and start forcing the issue near the final third. His pressing was probably the best of any match he's played in his short career.

&amp;#x200B;

* Moukoko got into some great positions but the professional game is a quicker than he's used to. This is a critical period for his development while Haaland is out. I think come January he'll be settled in as a pro and Haaland will be back to take a lot of the pressure and spotlight off during this rough time for the team.",gfysr8v,kdux0k,borussiadortmund,2020-12-16 05:50:01,AllwhitelikeaRacist,7

"\- Reus Sancho and Brandt were a tad better, but the poor form still shows, and none of them were protagonists

\- Moukoko is dope, but he's nervous about it all and it shows. Of all aspects of the game, the one that he stands out the most (and the one that's not much different between youth and pro), is where he's lacking. Not his fault tho

\- Overall, good performance, attacking with another tempo, much faster and incisive. The kind of change that I wanted to see

Feels like these are balls Haaland could have scored especially the first two and someone like Alcacer wouldn't just by physicality.

"I'm not going to take this match too seriously because of how little time our players have had with the new tactics but it was good. Defensively I can't recall them having any good opportunities outside of their goal and the Burki save, offensively we had plenty opportunities and Moukoko should have buried atleast one of the three chances he messed up, Reyna and Reus did well but it's definitely a match that won't be remembered

With some observations and I hate repeating what other people have been saying but Sancho had a decent game up until he has to make that one crucial pass and at this stage I can't help but wonder where his head is at the moment. It's like he wants to go but also wants to do really well here but he clearly can't do both. He is trying though so I will give credit for that but something is still missing.

At times we looked like the bad side of Favre's time by being too passive and not direct enough. Other times we looked more aggressive. I think the biggest change came from using a 4-2-3-1 which I always felt was the better formation for this team. Also, starting Moukoko as a striker opened the game up just a little bit more than if Reus or Brandt were played there. This in turn allowed Reus and Brandt to be put in their more natural positions.

"Press-conference with Michael Zorc and our new manager Edin Terzic:

(This is only the first half. Will post the rest later.)

* Sascha Fligge welcomes our new Cheftrainer and asks: Since yesterday you had to deal with a lot. How'd you spend these last 24 hours?

	* Terzic: ""It's true that these past 24 were unusual- the last 48 hours really. Of course the defeat on Saturday hurt a lot, and I have to take part of the responsibility, because I was part of the managing staff. I want thank Lucien Favre and Manfred Stefes for the work we did over the past 2 1/2 years. It was a very harmonic cooperation. From the very first moment we did everything to help the team ... That's why I wish both of them the very best, and I'm certain we'll stay in close contact. Apart from that, and with regards to the question, a lot of things changed of course. And it happened very fast. I had to think about a lot of organizational and substantial things. But now we have to focus on the match on Tuesday. We need to show a reaction. Yesterday we talked with the team. First I talked *to* them, then we talked to each other-  what we saw on Saturday wasn't Borussia Dortmund, so we demand from ourselves that we step on the pitch tomorrow and show a different team.""
	
* You drew Sevilla for the RO16. What do you expect from them? 

	* Terzic: They are a very very good opponent, but I don't think we can expect to draw any easy opponents in the Champions League. ... It isn't without reason that Sevilla won the EL several times in the past years. ... We're excited about the task, but until then there are so many other tasks and topics we have to care for.

	* Zorc: I think it's in interesting draw. Sevilla has become one of the top teams in Spain, of course a bit behind Real and, in the past, Barcelona. If you look at the current table, they can work their way to 3rd place with their remaining games. Unpleasant opponent, we know that. ... If you've watched the CL in the past months or the EL in past years. A team that plays for results and often succeeds in that. I think in this match-up there's no favorite and the matches will be close.
	
* Edin, what's your football philosophy and what plans do you have for the team? - Terzic: I'm a product of the club. I've been a fan of the club for ages and I'm from the region. For 10 years I've been part of the club, so I'm shaped by what happened here in the past. It would be very difficult to go into detail right now. What's important is that we communicate to the team, what reaction we want to see tomorrow. Fact is, there are two ways to win a football match. One is, we try to concede one goal less than the opponent. I prefer to score one goal more than the opponent.

* Edin, how long did you take to accept the offer from the club? Also, can you say something about the selection of your training staff? - Terzic: On Saturday all of us had a bad day and the night felt very short, before I had to make my decision on Sunday. Of course, I had to think about it. I was already part of the training staff and partially responsible for the result on Saturday. I sat down with my family and thought about it and then very quickly realized it's a chance to make things even. ... Regarding the staff, Sebastian Geppert will join me as co-trainer. People already know him. He did a lot of great work in the NLZ [youth academy]. He's a *Dortmunder Junge* and knows Borussia. ... I personally know him very well. We played football together and studied together and have already been colleagues, so there's a lot of trust. Otto Addo is someone known to every Borusse, someone who knows the team very well. I want him closer to the team to support us in our daily tasks and to help the team bring their best performance.

* You already took partial responsibility for Saturday. How did you perceive the decision to fire Favre and Stefes, with you becoming the new manager? - Terzic: I'm only human and have emotions. The defeat hurt, and then to hear of the decision about Lucien and Manni- I spent more time with them over the past 2 1/2 years than with my own family. So we're very close. I had to experience something similar and it's never pleasant. But we'll have to continue. Three matches until Christmas, so we'll have to move fast. Regarding big short-term changes: Of course, I could step in front of the team and drone on about theory and what we have to do different. But no, they showed a lot of good things on the pitch in the not so distant past. And we just have to remember those things and conserve them. We just need to have faith that we can recall those performances and the courage to put it in practice together. But we also need to have the will to fight back when things don't work out. And most importantly we need to remember these things every day. I think the fastest way of changing things is to adjust our mindset and to remind ourselves of our past strengths.

* Can you explain why that mindset was lost under Lucien Favre? - Terzic: That's a super complex question and hard to answer on the spot, for you guys as well as for us. We will review the whole thing, but it's not possible to do so in 24 hours. We need to approach it step-by-step.

* Is this a dream come true for you? - Terzic: It's an unbelievable situation. Most know that I'm from the region, I was born 30km from here.

"Now we have the official confirmation by the Club.

**Deepl Translation:**

Lucien #Favre is no longer coach of Borussia Dortmund. The decision-makers at #BVB unanimously agreed to release Favre and his co-coach Manfred #Stefes with immediate effect after the 1:5 home defeat at #BVBVFB.

Hans-Joachim #Watzke: ""We are all grateful to Lucien #Favre for his outstanding work over the past two and a half years, during which he has won two vice-championships with his team. As a professional and as a person, Lucien Favre is beyond reproach.""

**Until the end of the season, current co-coach Edin #Terzic will serve as head coach.**

The current U17 coach Sebastian #Geppert and top talent coach Otto #Addo will assist Terzic in his work with the team.

 BVB sporting director Zorc: ""It is difficult for us to take this step. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that the achievement of our season's goals is in serious jeopardy due to the recent negative developments in the current constellation and that we must therefore take action. #Favre",gfp4tmn,kcbbn7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 22:18:45,Chazy89,1

"[Interesting comment on Terzic by the usually well informed Dersch](https://www.kicker.de/bvb-unter-favre-zu-wenig-stabilitaet-und-zu-viel-stillstand-792172/artikel):

&gt; In Edin Terzic, BVB is now relying on an internal solution. The fact that the 38-year-old was already part of Favre's coaching team is no obstacle. In recent months, insiders already had the impression that Terzic had to hold himself back out of respect for his boss. Now he no longer has to have this consideration. Terzic, who is an engaging and casual type - and thus quite different from the friendly but distanced Favre - now gets the chance to show that he is much more than an assistant.

"While this was inevitable, I'm a bit torn about this. Whatever his faults (and he had many) he brought stability back to Dortmund post Tuchel, Dortmund became a force again quickly under him after the Peter era, he developed our players and gave youth opportunities to prove themselves. It sucks that we couldn't give him a better farewell. Now an unknown quantity takes over which is basically us giving up on the season and just aiming for top-4.

On the other hand, the football being played was dire. What were we playing? Counter attacking or possession football? If it was possession football, why were we not pressing as a unit to win it back early? Why sit in low blocks waiting to get attacked? If its Counter attacking, where is the pace? Barring Haaland, no one is fast enough of the block, no one daring to 1v1 on the wings, no directness. Just passive sideways passes. As a sidenote (and this is controversial), I don't know if it was Favre or Zorc, but this side is incredible unbalanced. No backup striker (proper), two wingers and a shit ton of AMs (Reinier really? While you have Reyna, Reus, Brandt for 1 position?) and midfielders. The recruitment should have been thought out better for the coach to work with.

Regardless, thank you, Lucien, you were a consummate gentleman and I wish you luck in the future.

To Edin, Otto and Geppi: Good luck. I hope you do well. We need top 4 to continue to progress.",gfpfi49,kcbbn7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 23:42:43,InexorableWyrd,22

"I would like to pretext my thoughts first, as sometimes it is easy to misunderstand criticism and assume someone has a completely negative opinion on someone.

Firstly, I absolutely do not think Favre is a bad manager, quite the contrary, he took us from a pretty unstable position after Bosz was fired, and after St√∂ger temporarily stepped in, to consistently the second best team in Germany, and contending for the league. In addition, as a manager that develops and nurtures young talent, he is maybe one of the best in Europe.

While, by no means a terrible manager, it has been clear for quite a while that he is unable to take us the next step. For myself, I found it frustrating we didn't make a move in the summer, because with him, I felt like we had seen this movie before. We've all become far too accustomed to failed title bids and collapses, as well as dropped points against lesser opposition.

What I did not expect, was the recent turn of bad results, and the comments from Reus and Hummels afterwards. It is unfortunate that he was sacked, but for me, it was the right decision. Increasingly, it seems like Dortmund may need to scrap for the top 4, and it is impossible for a coach to right the ship if he has lost the dressing room.

Therefore, a change was needed. However, I still stand by the opinion, that it would've saved us much more hassle if this has been done in the summer.

It will certainly be a difficult couple of weeks ahead, and I do hope this move gets a reaction from players, and Terzic is able to get some performances out of many that are lacking.

I hate to say it, but also maybe worth not fielding so many kids on the field at once as well. The old football proverbial applies, 'you don't win anything with kids.'",gfppxv9,kcbbn7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-14 00:56:18,Longboiii92,8

"I feel like this could also be a bit of a statement from the club. Bayern lost 5-1 last season after a poor run of form and fired their coach after he had just delivered a double, perhaps Zorc and Watzke felt their hand forced a bit as if they didn't fire him it could be seen as a ""that's the difference between Dortmund and Bayern"" statement.

"Honestly... pretty pissed off by this decision. While I guess most on here know that Im a big Favre fan, yesterday was too much for me aswell. I would have fully understood the decision to not extend his contract this summer.

 But firing him? NOW? In the week leading up to Christmas we have three important matches, then one week break followed by (hopefully) constant english weeks until may. No coach in the world would have the time to reinvent the wheel or make any big tactical changes to our squad this season. Hence the decision to appoint Terzic I guess, who I like and will fully support, but expecting him to get better results than Favre would have over the next half year is nuts. If this was end of march and we needed a fresh kick for the last few matches, fine. But in the coming months we really need the experience of someone like Favre.

No clue whats happening in Summer, all the usual names will get thrown around. Nagelsmann (thank god) and Rose isnt happening, the other available trainers dont get me excited in the slightest. kms if I see Rangnick anywhere close to my club.

"If 1-2 Players underperform it's probably their issue, if like 40-50% of your team suddenly underperform it's management!

In my eyes Favre will always be looked at as a manager that's good but will never win titles. He totally lacks anything that inspires people. After so many seasons of just failing when it counts most and coming in second I think the players themselves have accepted that stigma. Just look at them...Reus and Hummels just know that the team will fuck up when it counts.

Witsel been shit since he came he cant do nothing offensively he just kill our tempo, only benefit we can get out of him is subbing him on when w√® are up to kill the game

Sancho been great at overlapping with hakimi but now he cant find anyone too you can see him dribbling past defenders but then there is no one to pass to neither midfield or the wing, only thing he can do is to drop the ball back which he doesnt like and he shouldn't, there used to be hakimi to give him more space and options, now there is a munier lol",gfo5hm5,kc606o,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 17:19:30,Leonaide,-9
"Marco Reus after the game in the Sky interview:


&gt; ""Stuttgart were superior to us in every respect, in defence, tackling, counter-pressing,"" Marco Reus analysed on Sky after the third 1:5 defeat in Dortmund's home match history. ""They did everything we wanted to do,"" he said.

&gt; Within 90 minutes, BVB increased the number of goals conceded in the Bundesliga by 50 percent, from ten to 15. ""It's just the way it is with us,"" explained Reus: ""If we're not aggressive in the run-up, if we don't take on the duels, if we don't win the balls high, then we're just running behind."" This was followed by a verdict that could hardly be harsher: ""We're not a team that can defend well.""

Hummels:

&gt; ""2:1 - ball loss. 4:1 - ball loss. 5:1 - ball loss,"" Mats Hummels shook his head. After the break, he said, the ""very good"" guests were ""presented with goals by the dozen"".

&gt; *But why?* ""Among other things, it's the concentration,"" said Hummels. ""We always try to play small-small through tight spaces and have a hugely high ball loss rate. When it works, it looks good, like beautiful football. But it rarely works. I'd say there's too much 'hustling', we don't have enough depth in the game, we don't come forward enough and provoke our own ball losses.""

&gt; ""Sensible means: risk where it is appropriate and brings a return. Unfortunately, we play risk in areas where the return is small, but the defensive consequence is very big. Often we can conceal this through individual class, but today it went mercilessly wrong. We cut our own flesh every minute.""",gfk2a3r,kbrswm,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 01:45:02,Chazy89,1
"Favre has done his. Its time to find a new coach. Just watch the change Bayern made with Flick. 
We can blame different players, depth or other stuff all we want. But stuttgart, Augsburg and K√∂ln arguably do not come close to us in all of those categories. 

Favre supporters may say that he has great tactics, coaching or subs. But it is obvious that he dont have the package to make us a bundesliga contender. Just remember that favre was brought on with the goal to win it all. Not only qualify to CL. 
One could argue that much of our results come from pure talents like sancho, rapha, haaland, reyna ect. Questioning how much favre really does for us.

"I don't know if this was worse than those two nightmare derby day results (you know the ones), but it's surely next in line. It could have been even worse if not for B√ºrki, Reyna, and Rapha sparing us some first half blushes.

The Cologne and Frankfurt games were very poor for us, but this one really fits right in with the DoppelPeter 17/18 season. Right now, my mood probably matches my state of mind from 3 years ago. Perhaps it's actually worse now due to what 2020 has brought to the world.

B√ºrki was probably the only one to give a consistent performance. Besides that and the individual moments involved in our goal, Stuttgart was outright the better team.

Anyone think we should give Zagadou a crack at the lineup again? What about Moukoko?

B√ºrki is MOTM if we're feeling up to having one.

The idea that Dortmund should continue with Favre because the name brought in to replace him  won't have more accomplishments next to it so far beneath what this club and fans deserve. I'm not saying we will go on to win a double or treble if we replace the manger but I will say that we can certainly bring in someone who won't allow 1-5 home loss to a newly promoted side without sincere consequences.",gfjp5t2,kbrswm,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 00:33:35,AllwhitelikeaRacist,20

"I'm usually not as critical of Favre as others on this sub and thought our more recent struggles came down to poor form from individuals. Today was a complete failure both tactically by Favre and individually by players.

Very Long Edit:


The first thing that really stood out to me was the way we were playing out of the back. Stuttgart set up what I thought were obvious traps that forced us inside as we moved up the pitch, and then back out wide near the box. Like an hourglass, and we played right into letting them win the ball pretty much at will. 

The next thing I noticed was the way they played out of the back. They did not kick it long, but instead played it short to the center half, then out wide to the fullback. This invited pressure from Dortmund, and then the attacking players would drop deeper to receive the ball. This also brought our center halves forward creating space for Stuttgart players to run into, either with the ball or to receive the ball. Favre, who I usually praise for adjustments in the second half of games, completely failed to stop this. Stuttgart are not a great technical team nor do they have great dribblers, but with the amount of space they created it did not matter.

Defensively it was one of the worst performances considering the talent Stuttgart have. We made them look like Galacticos. Morey, Hummels, Akanji, Rapha, Can, everyone of them backed off of challenges and didn't pressure the ball. Jude did not help and Wistel only slightly did. I think Reus won more challenges in our attacking third then either full back.

We continue to struggle breaking down teams without Haaland and I can't help but think its a lack of awareness as to where people are. Reus is my favorite player so I'll usually keep an eye on him, and constantly I saw him in space with his hands raised calling for it. What is the point of having technically good players if they can't play a diagonal ball 15 meters? Sancho was not bad this game but he excels with space and with overlapping players. We looked lost and only scored from a Rapha wonderpass and great finish from Gio. Even if Stuttgart put 10 men behind the ball, there has to be some way we can score in 45 against that. I'd been saying our defense was better this year and our attack was not as good because we were more cautious. But this game we did attack and push everyone forward and still there was no goal and barely a chance. We give up easy counter goals and have nothing to show for it. 

There were no positives other than a moment of class from Rapha and Gio, and a few good saves from Burki. If Favre has lost the dressing room then I agree, Dortmund should look at who is available.",gfjnp87,kbrswm,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 00:24:45,Mr__11,38

"I dont hate Favre but he has to go. You really cant defend this and the players looked lifeless out there.

Which brings me to a controversial point but one that needs to be adressed - Everyone in this team over the age of... 20? except MAYBE Guerreiro and B√ºrki need to take a hard look at themselves in the mirror, because they have been absolute shit for the past month. EVERYONE, no exceptions. 

I can excuse Bellingham making errors leading to goals to a degree because, I mean, he is still a kid making his debut season. I can even excuse Sancho's bad form to a degree. I **CANNOT** excuse Can's tackle leading to the pen, or all the misplaced passes today, or Reus's magical disappearing acts, or Witsel having 0 impact in the game, or Hummels leaving 30 acres of space in the center of the pitch.

EDIT: Remember when after the double Peter season Watzke and Zorc (rightfully I may add) decided that we needed some more experience and got older, more established leaders? Guys like Delaney, Witsel, Hummels, Can, etc? Yeah I agreed with them then because I thought we needed some leadership and having more established stars would help guide the ship better.


EXCEPT, FOR THE PAST MONTH OR SO, THE KIDS HAVE BEEN GUIDING THE SHIP WHILE THE ADULTS DRINK THEMSELVES AWAY IN THE CELLAR. Fucking tired of this.

In case you‚Äôre forgetting. We‚Äôre about to pull 1 out of 9 points from Koln-Frankfurt-Stuttgart, and our only point was because Reyna bailed us out with a banger. And as others have mentioned, time and time again it‚Äôs just individual brilliance that bails is out.

There is obviously a change needed right now. The supporters are ready for one and the players may need one too. We look far too impotent unless we grab an early lead and teams are drawn out to try and equalize.

You can say whatever you want about believing mentality bullshit, but at the end of the day this team hasn‚Äôt looked up for it for a while now. Haaland is a robot made in a laboratory and he has helped mask the problems we have. And even still, he expresses frustration with out play multiple times a game.

OH WAIT.. luck. We‚Äôve gotten lucky so many times and ridden on the back of individual sparks of brilliance. But even that lately has been lacking: Reus, Brandt, Sancho.. just a few of the players seemingly unable to play to their potential or even match last year‚Äôs performance!

We‚Äôre actively declining in form, not improving or growing. Something needs to change. I‚Äôll love this club no matter what happens, but god I want to look forward to matches again..",gfjpo1j,kbrswm,borussiadortmund,2020-12-13 00:36:29,dr_bing,8

"I figured we'd be able to comeback with the eventual Reyna/Moukoko subs, but we definitely needed Zagadou for the final phase once we'd taken the lead.

Still can't believe how casual Witsel made that shot look though. Just passing it low into the near post as if it was no big deal. I had to see Pischu's celebrating face before I realized it had gone in haha! üòÖ

if you can't bring the basic - effort - you won't stand a chance against any side in professional football.

And I completely disagree to all of those who blame Favre for the attitude problems some players in our squad have atm.
If you are a professional player, who works hard every day to compete on the highest level, there shouldn't be any need of an external motivation.

Today, especially in the first half, I saw a lot of players lacking 100% effort.

If you can't bring effort to a football game, step aside and let others do the job...

"Bellingham definitely the best thing about today. 

Zagadou and Can did some good stuff at the end, especially Zaga. Schulz as well, I know this sub likes to hate him but I think he's actually very, like very good as a LB. 

Reus was better than usual, too bad *that* shot didn't go in. Hazard was solid but still could be better. 

I have no idea what's going on with Brandt, also props to Witsel for scoring but game after game I just get the feeling he's useless against teams that don't want to actively attack us. 

Ended up with a crazy young line-up at the end, hope the youngsters are gonna be motivated by this game. 

Am the only who missed the butt clenching in our games? Haven't felt this invested in the game for quite a while (only in the last 15 minutes though), but is it just me or have games lately been pretty boring and ""decided"" waaay before the end?

"We didn't look nearly good enough on offense. It felt like we were a man down when attacking for like the first 60 minutes. We also didn't look physical or direct enough in the final third either. Our best opportunities came from direct shots towards goal and balls played into the area. However, not enough of that was done and we didn't look threatening at all with our passive horizontal passes in the final 3rd.

Our defense was alright, I think a little overrated this game. People are praising our defensive effort but I remember some penalty scares and opportunities we gave to Zenit in the box that could have really fucked us.

Also, did anyone else find it alarming how Reus just wouldn't pass it to Moukoko? Moukoko would make some positional runs only to be straight up ignored as Reus would opt to hold the ball and wait for another pass. I think Reus should have passed it in behind and through for Moukoko more in this game. Definitely since we were lacking direct opportunities for most of the game.

His missed passes aside I found his lack of effort and willingness to be the most frustrating part of this game.

I feel he doesn't instill that burning desire to win though. That all encompassing need to defeat your opponent. If the coach, the leader, has that you don't need every player on the pitch to because he will provide it. He will inspire it and the players will react either from love or fear.

"[Presser with Lucien Favre and Axel Witsel:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJXf_vDkGdU)

Questions to &amp; answers from Witsel are in English (time codes 3:21-4:57; 9:28-end)

* Squad / injuries - Favre: Haaland, Meunier, Delaney, Akanji, Guerreiro, Dahoud and Morey are out.
* How important is the group win? - Favre: We always play to win and be number one. It's probably important for the draw.
* How important is Axel Witsel for team balance / as a counterpart to the more aggressive, fast-paced players? - Favre: He has his role as mainly a play-maker in front of the defense. Of course, it's an important role.
* What about Reus? - Favre: We will continue to rotate. We'll see for tomorrow.
* You didn't mention Reinier. Is he back? Could he step up as a replacement for Haaland? - Favre: He had 14 days of quarantine with some solo-training at home. Today he trained on the bicycle. But it will take time for him to become fit. Tomorrow and Wednesdays he'll do solo-training again, then we'll see if he can return to team training on Thursday.
* Zenit is last in the group and there's nothing in it for them. What do you expect? - Favre: As far as I know their full squad is available and I think they'll give everything to win. We need to prepare well. If you saw their first match vs Brugge, at the end they lost 1-2, but it wasn't deserved. They had so many chances, they should've won.",gez21rv,k8gj3n,borussiadortmund,2020-12-08 03:19:50,StandardProcess0,9

Not quite sure if he would be meant as a direct replacement, they are probably too different for that. But for depth up front and an early replacement for Haaland (whose departure in 2022 imo is pretty likely) Malen would be ideal.

"As talented as Bellingham is it was a mistake to buy him at the expense of maybe not retaining Hakimi.  

Bellingham was a buy with the expectation of selling in the future for massive profit.  

On the other hand Hakimi was a vital piece to our offense that we haven't replaced (and was actually entering his prime).  I think we underrate Hakimi here because we still think of him as a defender first.  We replaced him with a defender.  Now we have a huge hole in our attack where he used to be and the style of play that saw us hit form in the spring has to be totally changed without him.

We don't have anybody else on the squad like him.  H√•land will run off the defender's shoulders but Hakimi doing that from wide made all the difference.  

We have Reus and Sancho and Brandt and Reyna and they all want to play short quick passes which can drawthe defense out of shape but now we no longer have Hakimi utilizing what they create.  

He wasn't just a pace merchant either he actually is a very good finisher and plays excellent pull backs when he beats the defense.

We act like we haven't lost anybody important because he wasn't technically our player.  But Madrid didn't want him and we could have had him for an investment.  I know we paid less for Bellingham but it will take years before he is consistently world class, and then we'll sell him.  

We had a chance to secure a unique world class talent during his prime years and chose instead to invest in a 17 year old.",geyon2m,k8du22,borussiadortmund,2020-12-08 01:52:23,greengiant89,9

"Absolutely on point! It's also people being like "" we are gonna be champions this campaign"" in August and ""we are still in the works"" in February. We have a championship team filled with world-class talent but we still manage to lose ""unlosable"" games. 

It is also the stupid tendancy to just keep making the same mistakes and never learning from them.

I also think that Favre's focus went from promoting Dortmund's fast paced play, high press and counter attacking expertise to making the team nit concede goals his priority. We've became a team playing not to lose instead of getting there to win, which didn't work as well *because we will never be the best defense in the league*.

I find the *so called fans* settling for 1 points and being 2nd to Bayern very sad. We need change, because we might lose our best players if we have no hopes of winning any silverware.",gevjzop,k827v7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-07 05:28:59,steffbenji,59

"Favre is not the best coach, but he is the best we could do right now. 

All these posts seem pointless to me because we don't have a viable alternative for Favre, so sacking him would be madness. I think everyone knows he will be our manager till the end of the season, unless something really really bad or really really good happens. 

The FavreOut crowd seems to throw around some names as a replacement, and I don't think any of them are realistic. 

* Marco Rose won't quit the great squad he's building at Gladbach to save us from a trainwreck. Also, we sound entitled like PL fans when they are talking about our players. Rose is a great coach but he's doing well there. 

* Jesse Marsh is way too inexperienced and Dortmund is a huge step for him from Salzburg. He has to manage somebody like Wolfsburg to prove himself in a top league, and many people here have a *very* optimistic view of him because he shouts like Klopp and appears energetic on the touchline. 

* Pochettino would be the stuff of my dreams but it's not happening unless he learns German, which I don't see happening.

We‚Äôre so dependent on one or two key players being fit and in top form. We shouldn‚Äôt be so fragile that an injury can derail an entire season.",gexakqm,k827v7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-07 16:12:32,jtthom,6
"Did anyone really expect Favre to win the league in 18-19? We were right in a transition period and we just got really lucky that Witsel and Delaney fit in the squad so well (plus getting Hummels back right?). Not to mention Paco having a crazy good start to his time on Dortmund. We got incredibly lucky that the title race was close that year (and yeah we probably should have won) and I feel like that destroyed people's expectations for the rest of Favre's tenure. Even with this squad we are still far behind Bayern in overall quality, just look at the differences in salary between the two teams. And even though we have some incredibly gifted young players they clearly aren't consistent enough yet. Just look at Sancho, he is nowhere near the player he was for most of last season. Reus is suffering a drop in form as well. Hazard has been injured a fair amount, along with Delaney and Zagadou. Those things add up and make winning the ""easy"" games hard. I can understand our position right now. The season is played on paper and just because we have ""quality"" players doesn't mean we're going to win every game or even all the games we should win.

I don't think Favre is the best coach in the world and obviously he makes mistakes with lineups and subs occasionally, but as others in this thread have pointed out this was also an issue during Tuchel's time at the club. I think that the club is in a really difficult position right now in terms of managers. We need to keep qualifying for CL to keep up with wages and be in a generally good position financially and this requires conservative approach to everything. There is no taking a chance on an unproven manager or drastically changing up the team/system when we're doing decently all things considered.",gevwi5s,k827v7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-07 07:14:59,doubleomarty,21
"Let us be real honest here. Even Klopp has been chased off after the legendary last place after first half of the season by many, many fans.

The fans, or better humans in general, have become an unhappy, whiny, wanna-be expert group of people. 

If we play well, it is individual performance, if we play bad, it is Favre. 

Our team has many players under 21, we have far less money than the top 5 or even top 10 in Europe, so losing title against Bayern or games vs PSG or others is the norm and not the fault of Favre. We need to compare ourselves with Leipzig, Gladbach, Leverkusen and others, because those teams have the same problems than we have: They have to give up their top players from time to time. 

Every team which gets to keep their top players, plays in another league. Because they can strengthen their team and make it better year for year, whereas our team is just waiting to be torn apart. If we get to the half finals in CL, you can bet your ass that Haaland, Sancho and maybe one other youngster will be off to a better team. 

But admittedly, Favre is not the best coach, because his abilities come from intellect. And soccer is no game of intellect, it is a game of fight and heart. Everyone though who believes that with whatever coach we get next will make us a serious contender for the national title or even the CL is sorely mistaken.",gexdxhw,k827v7,borussiadortmund,2020-12-07 17:10:42,CorpseeaterVZ,11

I would love nothing more than to win the league and champions league, but nothing is normal right now. Getting angry about something we can't change won't make you happier. Our team is playing well and just because we haven't ""min/maxed"" the perfect season doesn't mean our coach should be fired. Being okay with a point in a match during a month where we play upwards 10 times is brutal, we're already seeing injuries begin (as well as every team in the league). I think this season will be a marathon and for the amount of you who want even BETTER results right now should be told to be patient.

"Tuchel really?

Tuchel's first season we played very well, but we had a good squad, comparable to this and last season, if not better. Sokratis would easily be better than any our current cb not named Hummels. Plus Gundogan. And an actual backup striker in Ramos.

Second season we were horrendous, games were sleepy (like 70% of our league games), we wasn't dominant in our games, although our squad was significantly weaker. That Pokal tie against Bayern was quite lucky, two goals from Dembele's individual moments. Also for CL, our ro16 opponent was Benfica, and I'm not convinced we would have beaten that Monaco team with the quality they had.

It used to be that we had 8-9 teams that were a threat, Bayern, Leverkuzen, Bremen, Schalke, Gladbach, Wolfsburg, Stuttgart at times and us.

Any one of these could take a point from Bayern and things were more balanced. Losing to any of them didn't mean disaster and you could still win the league.

These days other than Bayern and fucking Red Bull we shouldn't be losing to any of them. They are a shell of their former self and it's the reason Bayern keep winning title after title. All these teams are average at best.

We've got by FAR the second most talent in the league and we're struggling to stay 2nd...

Not only that but we're losing to fucking K√∂ln..... This is all on coaching 100% everything else is just making excuses.

"While I agree that he is a good coach and do not think that he should be let go, point average doesn't really mean all that much.

You already pointed out that the quality of the opposition has a huge impact on the point totals and what you can win with those points.

The other part in evaluating a coach is what they get out of the squad. 70 points can be a huge achievement with a squad of journeymen and also-rans and it can be a disappointment with a squad full of players, that are generally rated highly. That seems to be a tenor with the #favreout-crowd. That this squad should perform better.*

Thirdly, professional football is an entertainment product. If fans feel the football being presented to them is more infuriating than it is enjoying to watch, that is not a good thing.
I personally have mostly enjoyed Favre's tenure (adjusting for Covid), but it seems like some people are not.

*To go on a slight tangent: I blame the FIFA gamesa and FM in this. A lot of (younger) fans seem to have the view that Dortmund players have a certain rating and f.e. Cologne's players have a lower rating, so Dortmund should win. Or that the players should always play at the same level.

"That stat is always so stupid to me.

Klopp took over when we were a mid-table team and build it up with Zorc. It was a hard and long road but they managed to make Dortmund what it is today, winning titles.

Meanwhile Favre took over one of the most promising Dortmund squads, probably ever. He might have a higher points per season/game stat, but that does not make him the ""best"" or ""most successful"" coach in my eyes. Klopp still is and probably will be for the unforeseeable future, despite his last season. 

So that argument is always bewildering to me. If anything, I always argue Favre did not get out more despite that talent he has at his disposal and therefore is not the right coach for us.",geuv3qy,k7y5qo,borussiadortmund,2020-12-07 02:37:44,Hazardhunter,36
"In theory: Yes.

In practicality: No. PPG is a terrible way of judging managers.

Favre's a good coach, nobody should decline this. He's shown his ability at all his clubs but I don't think this is the job for him anymore. His quote about being happy with 1 point really highlights an issue, his ambition, mentality and approach to coaching hasn't changed with the state of the team. 

We're a different team to how we were when he took over, much better and with stronger ambitions but his mentality hasn't kept up with it. You have to remember, things changed quickly. When he took over we had only just scraped CL, Sancho wasn‚Äôt who he was, had an injury prone striker on loan, half the squad was new etc. It‚Äôs fair that he never kept up.

"I'll repeat what I said elsewhere:

&gt;Favre is a very good coach. He plays an effective, entertaining, attacking football and he gives chances to young players and makes stars out of them.

&gt;The problem is, seeing how we are so far behind Bayern in terms of finances and the ability to attract and retain superstar players, a very good coach is simply not enough. We need to have a coach that is faaaaaar better than theirs to be able to beat them. A superstar coach if you will.

&gt;Favre did everything a very good coach could do. Took second place every year. Advanced from the group stage of the champions league every year. Broke goal scoring records in the Bundesliga.. etc.

&gt;Many supporters are fed up with Favre because they want a superstar coach instead of a very good coach. The problem is that it is very difficult to attract and retain superstar coaches, just like superstar players. For example, we can't get Pochettino, nor can we afford him if we wanted. The management knows this, and they know that it is already difficult to find even a reliable very good manager, and that is why they are holding on to Favre.

&gt;My verdict: Unless we have the next Jurgen Klopp ready to take over after Favre, we should hold on to him. We should be happy with second place, until Bayern gets a shit manager like Kovac and then we can take the chance and win the Bundesliga.


And I will add: Klopp's success benefited from Bayern being relatively bad in the 2011 and 2012 (scoring only 65 and 73 points respectively) .. since then Bayern never scored less than 78 points per season. Even our record point season of 81 points, would not have been enough for us to win the league in 6 of the last 8 season.

Moukoko has fantastic positoning, he did pretty well overall but there were a few poor touches that lost opportunities.

Glad to see Big Zag back in the game. He performed decently well. I've always loved how he passes, so direct and powerful but it was off today which isn't unexpected due to his lengthyl injurey but lost us a decent amount of possesion.
I am absolutely loving Morey, our right side has so much more energy and flow compared to when Meunier is on.
I love seeing brandt in the game but Favre needs to stop putting him as a striker. It doesn't work, should have played Toto.
Schulz was pretty decent although we seemed to play more on the right side so I kinda forgot he was on the pitch a few times and it wasn't until he made a great tackle blocking a one on one that I remembered he was there.

I thought we would get the second goal today when we were putting on the pressure but many fouls allowed Frankfurt to slow the game down and disrupt our rhythm and we never got back into it.

Zagadou clearly needs some match practice he was pretty bad especially in his passing. Morey looked really good for most of the game and Schulz even did okay today. Sancho was alright but not at his best yet unfortunately. Glad to see Moukoko get some significant minutes, I do think we improved with him on the pitch but he was only impactful for maybe 30 minutes before he receded a little.",geplgng,k7ac2e,borussiadortmund,2020-12-06 00:37:00,doubleomarty,9

"Awkward times today.

Well, the first half was a total wash for the team and for me. I was struggling with both my internet and ESPN+ taking a siesta in addition to a slow breakfast/morning ritual.

I haven't had to watch a game on stream since Dembele and Auba were on the scoresheet against Hamburg. 8 of the starters on that team are no longer in our squad. Thanks for that one ESPN. üôÑ

Due to all the ""technical difficulties"" I had and a bit of stream delay on the alternative method, I don't have too much to say on this one. I'm glad we found a way back into it in the second half, but I agree with Owomoyela saying neither team really deserved to win. A half for both teams and thus the spoils are shared.

One of Bayern or Leipzig (if not both) is automatically destined to drop points later though, so there's still a mild positive I guess.

Reyna for MOTM or is there another worth noting?

"Frankfurt scored an early goal but offered nothing else in the game. No threatening attacks and their defense didn't even look that great. We should have really found a way to do get a win out of this.

The first half wasn't good, our midfield wasn't creating anything for the attack and the attack lacked number and physicality. It was a really positive change when Moukoko came on and Brandt moved to the midfield though. More opportunities came from that change. I hope this finally proves that Brandt is a midfielder and NOT a striker or a winger.

Moukoko and Morey look promising. Moukoko was kind of wasteful but he got in good positions. Morey looked pretty solid all throughout imo. Kinda remind me of Guerreiro.

Zagadou was playing horrible passes all game long. Just giving it to the other team.

The defense overall though was solid apart from the goal where our organization and marking could have been better. No real threats outside of that goal.

Reyna probably MOTM. Scored our only goal and looked lively all throughout the game.",gepok3x,k7ac2e,borussiadortmund,2020-12-06 01:04:31,Trojan_Man68,4

"Oh boy, what a meh performance. Play like shit first half, play well second half with some chances missed.

I feel a bit bad for him since there are so many people (myself included) who keep on calling him out for a shit performance but at the same time Favre puts him there despite knowing he is underwhelming outside of CM and CAM so what gives? Why is he constantly playing out of position?

Another point I want to mention is Witsel's passing. I personally would like to see him play as a CB in a 3atb formation because there I might actually see him play a forward pass. Don't know whether he is told to pass it back to our defense or every time he gets the ball our players are suddenly not in any space for a pass so he has no choice.

It was too nervy and just waiting for a sketchy call like the pen they got. I was really frustrated seeing Lazio barging into our guys over and over again too. Some of those seemed like obvious fouls to me....

It's good that we still got a point, but we'll have to match Lazio's result next week (Away vs. Zenit; they lost 3-0 to Brugge today) to win the group now unfortunately.

I'm inclined to go for B√ºrki (he had some very CRUCIAL saves) as MOTM today. Rapha gets an honorable mention of course.

I actually think we will look back on his tenure here and look at the talents that were here and wonder how we didn't accomplish more but maybe thats just me.

"The only bad thing I hold him accountable for is the botched title in his first season. At winter break we were 9 points clear off Bayern, we allowed them to catch us due to very bad form in the second part of the season having lost games in embarrassing fashion. The rest is just Bayern really who have been strong and even more ridiculous since Flick took over. We gotta say though Favre has had the most talented indepth squad we've ever had so finishing second is the bare minimum.",ge6ip1u,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 03:56:23,47Lecht,12
"I see Favre as a good coach, but I don't see him as the coach to ""take us over the hump"". 

Favre has beaten top 4-8 teams pretty consistently (from what I recall at least), while being very bad (for a coach at a top team) at beating the bottom ~8 teams. 

Last year, we lost to Union Berlin and Mainz, while tying at Bremen, Paderborn and Freiburg. This year, we have already lost to K√∂ln (who hadn't won in 18 games) and Augsburg. This means that, so far this season, we have lost 33% of our games, with an easy schedule so far. 5 out of our 6 next games are against top 10 teams, for example.

I'm not saying ""fire Favre"", but I would say that dropping points against sides we shouldn't drop points against has been a consistent issue his time here, with little signs of improvement. That is a worrying trend and if that continues, we should at least look at our options.",ge69fh0,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 02:44:26,WvdH01,27
"well we might not have won titles with Favre but I'll always appreciate what he's done for us. He's brought us a lot of moments of joy, especially in his first season, brought the best out of many of our players.   


I know it's easy to just say ""we're unlucky that Bayern are the best team in the world"" but that's a fact. We would've won the title last season if Bayern weren't... well, Bayern.

"Favre has done well. We‚Äôve challenged for the league  title, had good games in CL, and he‚Äôs had the highest averaged points per game than any other manager we‚Äôve had. If you‚Äôre satisfied with that, cool but at the end of the day we haven‚Äôt won anything. I‚Äôm not counting the Super cup you may if you wish. 

My thing with Favre is the same old issues year after year since he‚Äôs joined, and these issues below are just my opinion. Favre at time lacks a plan B in games where we are struggling. He over works players by playing them day in and day out which then gets players fatigued and hurt, although he has done better in rotation recently. Favre also starts players who are struggling in form. Akanji was an example last season, although Akanji is doing FANTASTIC this season. Presently Meunier is an example and now he‚Äôs injured from being played all the time despite even with his bad form. The amount of times we concede on set prices and corners is irritating as hell too. We are also pretty bad when we take our own corners in offense too. Favre is stubborn on making subs in matches, again he‚Äôs done a little better this season with this issue. He‚Äôs done well but I believe our squad has more potential.",ge67llb,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 02:30:09,Andres_BVB,9
"Favre is a very good coach. He plays an effective, entertaining, attacking football and he gives chances to young players and makes stars out of them.

The problem is, seeing how we are so far behind Bayern in terms of finances and the ability to attract and retain superstar players, a *very good* coach is simply not enough. We need to have a coach that is faaaaaar better than theirs to be able to beat them. A *superstar* coach if you will.

Favre did everything a *very good* coach could do. Took second place every year. Advanced from the group stage of the champions league every year. Broke goal scoring records in the Bundesliga.. etc.

Many supporters are fed up with Favre because they want a *superstar* coach instead of a *very good* coach.  The problem is that it is very difficult to attract and retain *superstar* coaches, just like superstar players. For example, we can't get Pochettino, nor can we afford him if we wanted. The management knows this, and they know that it is already difficult to find even a reliable *very good* manager, and that is why they are holding on to Favre.

My verdict: Unless we have the next Jurgen Klopp ready to take over after Favre, we should hold on to him. We should be happy with second place, until Bayern gets a shit manager like Kovac and then we can take the chance and win the Bundesliga.",ge6ehj6,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 03:23:48,blacktiger226,10

"Favre has definitely been a solid coach and I'll raise my hand and say that I was one of the ones who wanted Favre out during October-November of last year, I have been reactionary plenty of times whenever Dortmund underperformed against ""lesser"" teams and been disrespectful towards him which I now regret. I personally believe that we need some manner of change though, whether it be to certain areas in the starting 11, tactics/formation, mentality (and I don't mean that in the sarcastic way) or simply a managerial change because I feel that this club is starting to stagnate(in terms of improvements with regards to other clubs I don't feel like Dortmund have improved as much as a Gladbach, Leipzig or Bayern) past Favre's first season but perhaps I'm wrong and I'm expecting too much.",ge6ofjw,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 04:41:06,EmSoLow,3

I highly appreciate the level of defensive security we have. I brought this up a few weeks ago but we were so used to the 4-2 or 3-2 wins where we conceded a significant amount but relied on our crazy attack to just outscore the other team. Now we play a more cautious game especially in the first half but we are much much less prone to counters. The Koln game stunk but aside from a half chance or two they had nothing going for them from open play. Yes the conceding from set pieces sucked but statistically that rarely ever happens and I doubt we'll see that again. Similarly after the Augsburg game we were playing great defensively because of actual adjustments which we never saw under Peters.,ge6nuxa,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 04:36:31,Mr__11,2

Ah yes second place and challenging for the tittle. If this is enough to get people satisfied we will never be a true top tier team. Favre is good at maintaining us at this level but i don't think he has what it takes to achieve big european status. As long as he stays will be forever seen as a stepping club for the big teams. Even if we see ourselves as a big club we sure as hell don't act like one. When we lose to bayern i always see people saying stuff like at least we played well. Who the fuck cares if we don't get a result no one remembers if we played well all what matters is the result. We have been filled with talent for some seasons now and we have won fuck all. Went other big teams don't win anything for 3 seasons at the very least they sack their manager. I know people say that their was no better option. But we should have atleast tried to get pochettino its time to put our big boi pants no and seriously try to attracct big names even if he would have rejected us all i want to see is some attitude which under favre we seem to lack.,ge634ia,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 01:54:32,Reivaj22,2
"After that game this weekend, it seems a bit...odd...to post this now. That was a horrible coaching job, and I put the blame for the loss squarely on Favre for the lineup he picked and the tactics they used. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a pattern with him. 

We've got more talent now than we've had since Klopp left, and almost all of it will be gone in a year or two. I like Favre, I honestly do. But if he isn't going to get us to the top of the table, then we need to make a change, and sooner than later.",ge6my4v,k3zjid,borussiadortmund,2020-12-01 04:29:22,wvrevy,1

"It sucks to watch the team struggle so much. Before Favre left I was convinced our problems resulted primarily from lack of form in our attacking players. Brandt, Sancho, and Reus were all really underperforming and then with Haaland out for over a month it was clear we were going to struggle to win anything. I feel like Sancho and Brandt (and Reus to an extent) have all improved a bit in recent weeks, but I think that Terzic doesn't have a clear enough plan to utilize everyone effectively. And there's obviously no time to radically change things anyway.

I don't know where I'm going with this, it's just heartbreaking to watch the team fall apart when the season had such promise.

EDIT: To clarify.. Im not saying we dont have players with respect, who are vocal and try to do this. Hummels, Reus etc. But its obvious they arent managing too and we struggling to establish such a culture aswell in general.

I gotta say, if the club didn't sign Haaland last winter, we would be in a very dark place as a club right now.

"I feel this game was a pretty good illustration of why B√ºrki is not up to our standards.

Yes, our defense was absolutely ridiculous before the first goal. But here's the important part:
Just because our defense fucked up does not mean B√ºrki can not also make a mistake.
""Who is more at fault"" does not matter when assessing a player's performance.
The first goal is a high cross with plenty of hang time that gets headed in right at the 5 meter
line. A high quality keeper catches or punches that away 4 out of 5 times, at least. 
B√ºrki rarely does, because he rarely comes off the line anymore. And a lot of our supporters seem to have
gotten so used to that, that they don't even expect anything else. But it hurts the team, and better keepers help
their teams a lot more in these set piece situations.

Second goal. Yes, he sees it late. Yes, Reus and Can should have blocked it. Again, I don't care who is to blame more.
But a keeper who wants to make a claim to be among the 4 best in the Bundesliga still has to do better there. Deflect it literally anywhere else, just a tiny bit to the side.

Third goal. If this was the only thing today, I probably wouldn't mention it. Not a clear-cut mistake imo, but not un-savable either. He barely shows any reaction.
A keeper who's main strength is on the line should probably at least show a bit more of an reaction there.

Fourth goal. Do I even have to say it? Again a header at the 5 meter box. Clear path to the ball, no obstructions. Just come out and box it away.
How people still don't recognize that B√ºrki is a large part of our set piece weakness is honestly baffling to me.

Anyway, blindly defending B√ºrki because defenders screw up as well or simply because he is our player doesn't serve anyone. Good keepers save you points, not regularly produce scenes
where the best defense is ""Well, the others did even worse"". The truth is that B√ºrki is not up to our standards, short and simple. However, I also recognize that there's little
we can do about it in the short term.",gk8r4m2,l2xhtx,borussiadortmund,2021-01-23 05:30:01,Sarrazin,15

Its going be a rough season where we fight for a top 4 spot. We might just barely get it. Then we will appoint a new coach in the summer who will probably give us a good run of form in his first season.

"Enough will be said about the negatives - which, today, was almost everything -, so to look at the positives: after the bad start, we actually played decently. Not great, but Sancho and Brandt put in some work at the front to create stuff and we it resulted in some of the better offensive football under Terzic.

Yeah, that's about it. I actually think Brandt had a somewhat alright game. He worked a lot, helped out in defense by clearing some free kicks or actually winning defensive duels.

Something that might not be discussed as much: I expected more from Morey. While he's lacking minutes right now, he just didn't offer much apart from Meunier-crosses into nothing.

The biggest problem we have right now is that there's simply no time to implement any real changes. Most of the time between matches is spent on regeneration, meaning that we won't be seeing any major differences from one match to the other.

I don't even wanna talk about how bad hummels was tonight because that was an embarrassingly bad display. Guerreiro needs a rest and haaland needs better service. Delaney looked overrun in the first half because Bellingham was nowhere but I will say Jude looked much better in the second half but it was too late by that point. Not having Delaney or Witsel for gladbach is gonna be really difficult.

"Terzic is walking a thightrope right now. He want's hard pressing (wich Reus did pretty excellent yesterday) and though defending like Delaney and Bellingham excell at, but he also wants to have fine technique and dribbling, outside of the boot passes. I think Terzic could actually do something if he decided for one or the other, both doesn't seem feasible right now.   
If he can drill a good defensive shape into the players, i think he could actually do something with a pressing 4-4-2. Rotate Can, Delaney and Bellingham in the middle, get Hazard back to fitness on the right, stick either Reus oder Sancho upfront with Haaland, take in Schulz as a no-nonsense option for leftback and relieve Rapha of some of his defensive duties in a left mid position. 

This is total armchair level analysis, but i really think Terzic needs to make a decision for or against certain styles, he can't be mixing it, the squad is not up for that.",gjxp8jx,l0to60,borussiadortmund,2021-01-20 19:49:50,chuukstat,3

"Dear Ghost of Favre,

Keep playing Reus in the center, Brandt on the wing, the two most defensive-minded midfielders available in midfield. Keep having Dahoud as your last option for midfield, because your plan is to create from the wings, through Meunier and out-of-form Guerreiro.. and finally, when you're down at the 80th minute, keep subbing in all your strikers. That will work.. oh, and keep it static and boring, and ""patient.""",gjwdpdc,l0to60,borussiadortmund,2021-01-20 09:55:02,IdeasNomad,3

Last week [Peter Flore](https://www.schwatzgelb.de/artikel/2021/auffe-ohren/auffen-punkt-52-ist-der-fantoken-nur-ein-symptom), former social media manager of the club, had some choice words about our persistent lack of club identity and how club values are currently (not) being defined and communicated.

"Our defense was terrible. Mainz had so many counter opportunities where we just let them dribble the entire field as we always tried to press and win the ball back immediately and failed. The only reason we didn't concede more was Mainz didn't bring more guys up into the attack or they just didn't notice teammates running free.

Other than counters, Mainz had no attack today, so why didn't we just track back and try and win the ball later? We tried to play for 100% possession, when going for 60% and playing safer defense would have won it. I think Akanji getting caught with the ball instead of going for a simple clearance and nearly giving up a second goal was very indicative of the defensive mindset, just a very arrogant and aggressive defensive approach that wasn't necessary or the correct approach today.",gjh343o,kylv9s,borussiadortmund,2021-01-17 00:30:27,SayyidMonroe,2

Not much we could have done with the Mainz wonder-strike, but when you don't take your chances, things like that will happen. Mainz had two or three more great chances to be up. So even with the missed penalty, this was a deserved draw.

The thing that stood out in the second half was that we were incredibly slow in the build up for most of the half, while Mainz pushed up more and started to establish themselves further up the pitch. Normally, this comes with a trade off, as you expose yourself defensively. But, since we were so slow to get the ball into any dangerous areas, Mainz had all the time in the world to setup in two banks of 5 again.

We played well, we created chances, we dominated the midfield. there isn't much we could have done other than scoring the created chances. If we replay this exact game 10 times we win 9 times.

2nd Half FC showed their mettle. Better decision making, Midfield dominance and Erling was brought into the game. MOTM could go to Erling for being so dominant, or Can for being the midfield engine but I think I'll give it to the captain for finally showing the class he is known for, involved in all three goals.

"I personally had Leipzig as big favorites considering forms (even if we beat Wolfsburg**) and our transitional period still being in full effect with Terzic. So I cant express how happy I am about this performance.

SO many positives imo:

- Sancho has been in great form these last few games, points aside. 
- Reus getting back into swing aswell more and more.
- Took 3p when Bayern dropped points!
- Took those 3p ourselves from a direct compatitor at the top!
- Can is such a mental and physical giant but his drives forward are    SO SO underrated. 
- Haaland is back :)
- That 1st half our offensive didnt get going at all until in the very end but our defensive did very well vs one of the most stressful and intensive teams. Namely our CBs. 
- Mentality, energy, concentration etc were all top notch from what I could tell from the couch. Start to end. 
- I shouldnt have to mention it but he deserves it so... Rapha is the GOAT. 
- Having Wolfsburg*** &amp; RB wins in the back of our head now is gonna be really good to keep going. Both decent scalps.

Honorable mention to Meunier who did better than I expected. Altho he started a bit iffy.

Only negatives were the Witsel injury and Guerreiro who looked like the worst performing player on our squad today. Also, we were rough in the 1st half when it came to creating substantial opportunities but our defense was great then.

I appreciate the fuck out of Mats and Akanji -- they were solid the whole game, especially the former.

"Half-assed summary of the presser with Terzic and Zorc:

* No new injuries. Moukoko back and maybe an option for tomorrow.

* Terzic expects an open match between two offensive/aggressive teams

* Something, something, this match is important

* RaBa is doing a lot of things right at the moment, but Terzic doesn't want to compare us to them. They have a strong defense.

* They lost an important player in Timo Werner, but that doesn't mean they're less dangerous. Became more flexible in the offense.

* Delaney is important to stabilize our defense / destablize the opponent

* Reporter: Why not hire Nagelsmann? - Zorc: &lt;says some nice things about Nagelsmann and ignores the question&gt;

* There are no offers on the table re: Brandt and other players",gildoi6,kt4476,borussiadortmund,2021-01-09 06:48:14,StandardProcess0,8

"I am maybe in the minority but I would love Ten Hag over Rose, and I think that there isn't a better time to get a better manager.

At the end of the season Ten Hag would've been at Ajax for 4 years, and there's some rumours about how Ajax want Overmars to stay because Ten Hag plans on leaving after this season. And Overmars himself is set for Barca. (I'm not quite sure how much of that is reliable)

After Ajax's fairytale CL season, Ten Hag seemed to be set for Bayern, but then Flick happened and now Nagelsmann should be comfortably the favourite to take over at Bayern should they somehow sack Flick, given how much he seems to be flirting with them.

In case of the top clubs in Europe, Pochettino is already taken, and should any team sack their coaches, surely Tuchel and Allegri would be leading candidates over Ten Hag.

So from our perspective and from Ten Hag's perspective, it's a really good match. We get a proven coach with a brand of attacking football and he gets a squad that's filled with potential, while also being a step-up, career-wise, from Ajax. 

What do you guys think?",gijffkn,ksy2n6,borussiadortmund,2021-01-08 21:39:48,Ciao9,9

"&gt;When he left You he wasnt celebrating goals against You only at 1st match

This is absolutely not true. He celebrates every goal like he just won the world cup. Tbf he does it all the time, not just against us. But the way he talked about Dortmund in interviews after he left was really pathetic. As if he was too big and important to play for a ""small"" club like Dortmund, even though it was *this* club that turned him into a world class player. He's just a super self-centered douche, and he gets away with it because he's really really good, sort of like Ibra just not as open about it.",gi9ie26,krb9m6,borussiadortmund,2021-01-06 11:28:08,PtboFungineer,52
"Its not the move itself that i am angry about. He has jeen very fair about it when watzke didnt allow him to leave, he had to stay another year and still gave his best. 

But, the way he has celebrated when scoring against us, as well as the way he talks about bvb as if it was some kind of small, insignificant club during his career... man, we made this guy. We pulled him out of a bad league and made him world class. And the only thing on his mind is his own career and his ego.",gi90k02,krb9m6,borussiadortmund,2021-01-06 09:00:51,Xsteak142,42

"With me, I've gotten over it, what's done is done. Sure, Lewandowski is probably the reason why Bayern have been so powerful for about 8 years and if we didn't let him go there or he chose a different path, perhaps we would have seen clubs like Dortmund, Leverkusen or even the disgusting RB Leipzig winning the league in between that time. I always respected him as a footballer even after he joined Bayern and kept on scoring against us. Was he destined to leave? I'd say definitely, I'm pretty sure he did say that he wanted to play for Bayern one day and United were close as well with Real somewhere behind. In a non aggressive way, I can't wait until he retires or potentially leaves because once he is gone, I truly believe that Bayern's dominance will slip and we will see another club winning the league which will be better for everyone",gi8v9ww,krb9m6,borussiadortmund,2021-01-06 08:17:19,EmSoLow,6

He ( cleverly through famously hated ex-manager ) made it clear very early that he is the ""career-plan"" guy who stays at a club 3 years and moves on.

So all illusions of a football fairy tale where crushed pretty early, probably 2 years before he left, so by the time he moved on there really was no emotion like hate in the air at all, only the usual disappointment that most players love the club much less than we do.",giacnkr,krb9m6,borussiadortmund,2021-01-06 17:09:54,Lanington,1

In the end, we lost a world class player for free to our biggest opponents in the league, they won it a hundred times in a row, and himself doesn't seem to care about us a single bit, and he was nobody until Klopp trained him.

I'm a little bit salty but man I even stopped watching football for a while after that (not only because of it, but it certainly influenced that). I don't even hate HIM, I just hate all the situation involving us and Bayern, and he was the biggest symbol of that one.

"What do you guys think about Kamaldeen Sulemana as a relatively cheap signing this winter? We could really use some more options on the wings and he could probably be bought for &lt;10 mil plus a few clauses.

What little I've seen of him reminds me a bit of Dembele when we got him. Still very raw, but with good two-footedness, very unpredictable and the speed and dribbling to beat his defender 1v1.

Leverkusen is rumored to be sniffing around, but we've made good experiences with snapping up players under their nose. 

It's unclear if we even want to afford that right now, but if we are indeed looking to strengthen our wings I think its hard to beat his combination of low price, potential, and immediate impact as a sub when we need the element of surprise.

If Sancho leaves next summer we will probably need at least 2 new players on the wings anyway, and Sulemana + a little more experienced option would seem ideal. Once he joins Leverkusen he will probably be unattainable for the foreseeable future.",gi2cuif,kq48y4,borussiadortmund,2021-01-04 21:24:09,Sarrazin,5

"Hopefully looking back at today we can say that this was a very important day for Sancho.

All in all a hard fought (and some could rightfully say lucky) win for us. But i think that's expected after a terrible Hinrunde and a new coach. We accepted the fight, even if we could still use more physicality in our game if u ask me.

Speaking of physical players: Tigges almost feels out of place in this team. I am not used to someone as physical as him up front anymore. Haaland is big and strong too but Tigges feels more like a bully and i love it. 

All in all an important win for our start into the R√ºckrunde. We are back on a CL spot which is the most important thing for now. Next stop RBL, time for Haaland to show the Bundesliga how good at goalscoring he is.",ghyseqw,kpnh69,borussiadortmund,2021-01-04 00:31:41,Ragemoody,21
"Incredibly important in so many ways.

- Win vs a team that will be threatening us from the uppermiddle table.
- Sancho had a 1+1 game. I dont think he had a great game overall but the 1+1 stand out and will be big for his mental-state at the very least.
- Great start to the year after a necessary break. 
- We REALLY want to get CL for cash-income so every point matter.

Started really poorly but overall Im quite happy with todays game. We grew into it and it was honestly a consistent performance apart from the start of the game. Something we havent had in a long time.


Sidenote: I still love what Tigges can offer. As I said in the matchthread, he's what we usually arent; Traditional 9, physical and simple.",ghysugx,kpnh69,borussiadortmund,2021-01-04 00:34:52,Qiluk,17

"We were doing everything we could to throw away the lead at the end until Sancho put the game to bed. 

Haaland was definitely more frustrated than usual, but I think he will come out next game very hungry and ready to smash a few into the back of the net. 

Tigges has been an absolute hustler when he steps on the pitch. Nothing flashy, but a great work ethic. Hopefully he grabs a goal after a few sub appearances.",ghysha9,kpnh69,borussiadortmund,2021-01-04 00:32:10,biggieBpimpin,9

Also happy that Sancho finally scored, things should be on the rise for him now. Tigges also looked great after coming on, I think he definitely has Bundesliga quality. Overall defense can be better especially our wings, even with Sancho and Reyna tracking back. But our two CBs played very well defensively. MOTM Akanji.

Also highlight of the game for me was when Rapha through balled to Haaland when everyone thought he was passing to Gio, and the reaction of Gio when he thought he missed it was great lol.",ghyspsu,kpnh69,borussiadortmund,2021-01-04 00:33:57,ZZZ0330,9

I really hope we just get a good solid 2:0 lead in ht and close it of quick with a 3:0 so we can rest a few players... Hummels needs a break, maybe even Haaland, Delaney most likely too

Im staying by statement at home, every game is a must win, doesnt matter if its Bielefeld, Freiburg or ManCity.

Hitz as a 2nd keeper is still a VERY underrated luxuary by our fans.


Also.. awesome news in terms of a transfer perspective. Until today I had the impression of both our current keepers being unhappy and wanting to move or be promised the #1 spot. Having a good #2 keeper sorted already means we wont have to fuck around and look for 2 keepers in the summer.

"Hey, I'm an American fan too. I started supporting BVB around 2015, I wasn't able to witness us win any league titles but I have been lucky enough to see us play good attacking football with a few different casts of players and led by a number of different managers. As sweet as it is to see the BVB whoop on S\*halke 4-0, or beat Sevilla 3-2, there are also the 4-4's against S\*halke and the devastating European defeats every now and then.

My point is that with as high as this club can be. it makes the lows that much more devastating. My only advice to you is to please not be one of those fans on twitter who, ""gives up"" or ""is done with this club"", after every bad spell.

"HE is THE guy we need to break all records for. I assure you we will become champion, win the CL and everything else winnable.

People WILL want to play with this machine, he will lure other players.  Anyone who hasnt realized it yet, Haaland is a generational talent, he already broke every record he can break for his age and his amount of games played. And he will keep breaking these.

If our board has any sanity left then they should throw that aboard and pay the man, what he wants. Haaland is the kind of player that will attract other known good players that WANT to play for us because of him, if he says something like "" I see myself for another 5 years here"" this would be a statement uncomparable.

Everyone has to realize (I dont like it but the 2 monsters is the only one who we can compare Erling with) This guy is the real deal, if he doesnt get major injuries, there is no way he doesnt win a handful of ballon d'Ors. He most likely will be the next Messi/Ronaldo outlier in every statistic possible. I can't stress enough how good he is for that age and thinking that ""normal"" strikers peak at around 29-30 I can't fathom how good he is going to be.

"1st half:

Literally prime Reus, Sancho &amp; Haaland sprinkled with some beautiful Dahoud and Can/Bellingham behind them. LOVED the intensity and how simple &amp; direct we played, which is something we need to do more in general. 

Reus defensive work should be applauded a ton.


2nd half:

Tactically infuriating. Literally ""we got 3-1, lets defend for 45m and give away initiative and intensity."". When we've been really shit defensively up until today, thats beyond naive and allows an underperforming Sevilla to try to find themselves again. Luckily they didnt fully but to allow them the chance is appalling imo. This also causes us to concede a lot of sloppy freekicks and corners which is our fucking achilles this season so its absolutly suicidal.



That said... Im ecstatic over the end result and it could be so massive for us both mentally and financially. The right people got some points too so individually its great for them. 

Theres also a couple of weeks till the return leg... Hopefully we dont have new big injuries and Hazard back. Could be huge for us.",gntcdxn,lm5tp3,borussiadortmund,2021-02-18 06:01:42,Qiluk,58

We started to unravel a bit at the end, but this one really should have been 1-3 as Can sleeps a little bit on the 2-3.

- Rose wants to use his exit clause and has informed Gladbach

As for us, I guess it's nice to already have some news as to what comes in the future and give us some stability.

As for Rose, idk, I think I'm with the large majority as to don't know what to expect, but I'm just hopeful and supportive as I'm always trying to be. Definitely think he's probably among the best we could've realistically gotten in these rough times so no complaints in that regard. Curious about what signings he could have in planning, considering that I don't think he really got to build his ideal team in Gladbach (I think he probably was gonna start to do the strong or strategic signings there but with the latter news...).

"I wonder what kind of agreement we have with Rose concerning how we'll handle things this summer. It's very possible that we won't make CL (hopefully EL at the VERY least), probably lose some of our most important players (Sancho and possibly Haaland, maybe more depending on our financial situation) and not even have that much budget to go on a shopping spree. 

Also, will Zorc/Watzke insist on having an assistant coach from within the club as Terzic has been under Favre?

Really hope this move is well thought out and our board knows what they're doing and let Rose do his job.",gnja9aq,lkdzab,borussiadortmund,2021-02-15 22:12:19,edworm,6
"As predicted by everyone and their grandmas. Hope sacking Favre was a good lesson for the young players and Watzke to be patient with the process.

"I maybe one in the minority here, but man, I feel bad for Gladbach tbh. Yes, yes, football is ruthless and it something I crave the club to be, because we aren't, but you can totally understand their fans hating Dortmund.

I do think he's a good coach, but I thought the same of Favre. But given how our structure is, there is a plateau, and that is not winning the league and CL. Unless we hit the jackpot, and Bayern dip considerably, especially considering potential player departures this summer.

I have made no bones about it, I would have taken Rafa Benitez, if the club didn't handicap itself with the having to speak the langauge malarkey. Too many years the defence has been a clusterfuck when it came to the crunch. Some will lambast him for his football without having seen his peak Valencia and Liverpool sides. He'd have sorted us out in that aspect. Even as an interim coach. The man quit his job China recently and all. And given what I know of him, he'd be an able speaker in a year's time. A damn shame.

"I don't think we have the squad he needs to succeed. Rose plays 4-3-1-2. 

The width is derived from full backs pushing high up. Our wingbacks, however great, are not speedy. His midfield three has two b2b ( Can, Jude,Delaney, and If Dahoud remains will like that) and a cdm that drops back into defence when needed. The role is perfect for Axel and no one else in the team. And we don't know if he will ever come back the same. 

The attack is created by direct interplay between the two strikers, CAM (which we have 4 for 1 position, wtf Zorc) and the 2 box to box midfielders. They create a pentagon of sorts and can create chances with rapid interplay. The strikers help press and stretch the backline. This is again a place where we need work, if we play Reus /Reyna/Brandt at striker its a waste of talent and they are not good enough there (except Marco is excellent at negative pressing) and we have Toto as well who Rose might shove in either ST or CAM so we have tons of CAMs, one proper starting striker and no width providing fullbacks(that are not Schulz). We need a lot of work to see Rose's vision achieved and with Covid-19, I don't see excessive retooling happening.",gnjddaa,lkdzab,borussiadortmund,2021-02-15 22:43:45,InexorableWyrd,8

"I think we all knew this, but don't know why Gladbach would publicly announce this. Is it mandatory for some reason? Don't know how this would affect both teams. Would Terzic and our team be more motivated, or no longer give a fuck? Also don't know how it would change the team dynamic at Gladbach and the player-coach relationship.

"Just like most of you I have mixed feelings about this. I guess we all hoped for a seasoned trainer that matches the potential some of our youngsters have. 

I'm also having mixed feelings wrt Edin. On the one hand I would've wished him more luck than he seems to have had. He's a pretty sympathetic, relatable guy. So I'm hoping he'll manage the upturn with this team, improve his vita by achieving his and let this be just a first step in a successful career. I somehow doubt he'll return to be assistant coach for us under Rose. On the other hand this announcement indirectly also means that we'll (have to) stick with Edin until end of the season, there's just no other temporary solution available that I can think of. And that means that either this team gets its shit together under Terzic or we end up not even getting a euro league spot for next season. We can't hope for Susi and Aki performing miracle magic of unveiling a different coach anymore, who is able to end the rut the team's currently in. The chance for the later was extremely slim anyways, so we may just as well accept the fact that we're stuck with Edin in the current situation and we just have to intrinsically achieve the upturn.

Let's hope for the best for the rest of the season. We'll see how we'll perform under Rose next season. But now it's time to get back to success together with Edin.",gnjd6ez,lkdzab,borussiadortmund,2021-02-15 22:41:52,Fadhmir,3
There were inevitably going to be people who had their own preferred managers and get disappointed with whoever got chosen but I'm willing to accept this and welcome him for now but it will take some time to digest this move because I find how he is leaving a little disrespectful to Gladbach.

wtf is our board doing? Putting Terzic as an interim coach is understandable, he could have a try on it, but it clearly isn't working out and we're going to have a tough rest of the season from now on, the best I can see us going is 4th place, and one or two more steps on the cups. If we get that it's fine, but if we fail CL the board really fucked up this time.

Also, I have to add my condolences for gladbach, they don't deserve this kind of manoeuvre, if they go after ten hag or March I don't see why we didn't get one of them and let Rose keep improving his job there.

About Rose in particular, I'm happy, he seems a good coach, but I can't expect much more from him than for favre, hope I'm proven wrong.

The squad is great and has an extreme potential, but one can't expect to work out from the start. I really believed the hype, but what is happening right now had to happen I guess. After this season, Sancho will leave for ManU and then, probably with a new coach (Rose?) in 1-2 years, we may have a chance to win the league.

"I am from Egypt. I discovered the club when I was a 12 year old, through Fifa 2000. I wanted to support a club that wears black (my favorite color) and that was German (my favorite national team). My favorite player at the time was Andreas Moeller (also through Fifa 96, since there was no way to watch German football in the 90s in Egypt, other than in the World Cup or Euro). So it was a perfect fit, a German team that wears black and had my favorite player, so I started supporting Dortmund.

I started being able to follow and watch Dortmund actually play around 2002/2003 season, with the generation of Koller, Amoroso, Rosicky, Dede .. etc. and I have been supporting them since then.

At that time, no one in Egypt knew what Dortmund was, and my friends would always laugh at me when I said I was supporting Borussia Dortmund, thinking that I am just saying that to be a hipster. Everyone at that time was supporting either Man Utd, Arsenal, Milan, Inter, Juve or Real Madrid. Even supporting Barcelona was seen as being a hipster back then.

Egyptian people only started knowing about BVB when Mohamed Zidan joined in 2008. My love of BVB and the German national team pushed me to study German in high school and later on to do my Master's degree in Germany.

Unfortunately, I left Germany in 2013 without ever getting the chance to see them play live or to attend a game in the Westfallen Stadion. During my time in Germany, I was a poor student and I could not afford the train ticket to Dortmund and the ticket to the actual match.

Now that I actually earn enough to be able to do that, I am all the way across the ocean :(

"California. Discovered the club when my brother showed me fifa back in 2011 and used Dortmund and especially Marco Reus to beat me. From then on Dortmund was my preferred team and Reus my favorite player to use in fifa. At this point I wasn't a true supporter. I just kinda liked the club. Then I went to college and made friends with some international students from Jordan who were very big into fifa (and let me play with them all the time which was awesome because I did not own a console yet). They were diehard Real Madrid fans and when they asked me which team I supported and I answered ""Dortmund"" they replied with approving nods and something akin to ""hell yeah"". At this point I did not know anything really about the club like our diehard fan base or our perennial struggle with Bayern for Bundesliga dominance. But hanging out with the Jordanians I was watching champions league and la Liga games and playing a lot of fifa. I learned a lot about the sport and all the different clubs as well as where to find Dortmund games. This was in 2015. I've since been watching as many games as possible and represent the club when anyone talks about football in front of me. I know I'm not German and was not born in Dortmund or even that part of Germany, and I know Dortmund is insanely attached to their club and so in a way I feel like an outsider. But that's fine. I love the club. I even listen to the songs like Ole¬¥, jetzt kommt der BVB and even try to sing it when we score üòÖ I'm sure my pronunciation is bad but I have fun anyways.",gmzx0i4,lhubco,borussiadortmund,2021-02-12 07:18:42,Trialbyfuego,17

"I'm from St. Louis, MO and my first time abroad at 13 was when I discovered Dortmund and what the club is about. My dad's best friend Philipp who grew up and lives in Hamburg flew me out to visit him and travel around Germany.  Philipp grew up a St. Pauli fan and converted my family into fans when I was a little kid, but he also admired Dortmund, saying that seeing a game at the Westfalenstadion is one of the most special things in the world.

During my trip there, we were lucky enough to be able to see a game in Dortmund! This was during the 12/12 strike, and it was against Wolfsburg with KDB, Naldo, Dost, and crew! We scored before the 12:12 mark, and hearing the Yellow Wall shush the entire stadium for cheering was incredible. When the 12:12 mark hit and the Yellow Wall burst into chaos, I knew that the club was special. 

Additionally the performance on the pitch made me love the team, Gotze and Reus reminded me of my best friend and I on our soccer team back home, and watching that team under Klopp was some of the most exciting soccer I ever watched. Philipp was right, watching that game, even though it ended 3-3 and was freezing cold, it really was one of the most special things in the world - it made me fall in love with a club I knew next to nothing about.",gn0c2bh,lhubco,borussiadortmund,2021-02-12 09:27:00,StPauli-Ultra1910,4

I chose team randomly, and then I saw the game's cover which was Marco, and thought, hey I like the jersey, that'll be my team.

I signed up for ESPN+ a while back and now that they have the Bundesliga, I thought it would help me get my German soccer fix. Picked BvB after reading a blog post which had a guide to all the teams. So, still new, but I love the energy soccer brings. I think the super bowl was a few hours for only an hour of play. Soccer, on the other hand doesn‚Äôt stop, with a few exceptions, but the clock is always running and there isn‚Äôt all the downtime other sports have. I hope one day to make it to a BvB game.

Eventually I just felt closer to the team and familiar with the players. Fast forward 9 years since the dorms and now I wake up early every weekend for games, take lunch breaks around champions league times, and read tons of transfer rumors.

"From California. 

My father is a chemist, and one day brought home an authentic Dortmund jersey from work. He had no idea who BVB was, and said ""here you want it?""

Turns out he had a business meeting with a German client who worked for...you guessed it....Evonik. They gifted my father the jersey saying ""this is the best team in Germany!."" It was just after the 2010-11 season. 

After I got the jersey, I started waking up early to watch the games. Been doing it ever since. I fell in love with the club. Then I went to study abroad in Germany in 2017. I was living in Stuttgart and made it my goal to go see a home game in Dortmund. I bought my ticket and took a Bla-bla car with some very nice people to Dortmund. I met a local fan who had season tickets and invited me to drink beers with him and his friends. Little did I know their tickets were for the Yellow Wall, and they snuck me in with them (despite my ticket being for a far less desirable seat). 

Of course, I wore the shirt my father gave me that day. We beat Frankfurt that game, with an absolute screamer from Sokratis, of all people. One of the coolest days of my life.

"Las Vegas. Just moved recently to Los Angeles, but became a fan when Pulisic broke through at a young age and was playing in the Champions league.

Always have been an international soccer fan, but accessibility to the sport in Europe was hard to come by and required waking up at 6:30am on Saturdays to watch matches. I tried to like so many different teams, but nothing ever clicked until watching Pulisic at BVB, and then I realized a lot of the German players I loved watching in 2010 and 2014 played at BVB....Mario and Marco, Schmelle, etc. 

There are a lot of parallels between BVB and my favorite American Football team, the Green Bay Packers. The teams stories and the way the organizations are run are near mirror images, and other BVB and Packers fans agree that's one of the major influences on the fandom. 

The rest is history, now I have about 5 BVB kits, a bunch of other apparel, and was lucky enough to see BVB play LAFC in a friendly in LA a couple years ago. I have actual dreams of my first match at Westfalenstadion and have been practicing German and know most of the fansongs for the day my wife and I get to stand on the S√ºdtribune and scream our guts out.",gn8ot2v,lhubco,borussiadortmund,2021-02-14 00:43:20,Bammer1386,1

9 years later, I‚Äôve met the team in Singapore and have visited Westfalenstadion, but unfortunately I still haven‚Äôt seen them play live.

"So unnecessary, so much energy lost. The problem was not the goals that were conceded, that can happen, the problem was how many counter situation we have wasted.

Of course the performance was not perfect, but I thought that both Schulz and Passlack were very active and Mo Dahoud was pretty good.

Great to have a guy like Can.

Why wasn't Sancho replaced earlier, he looked dusted way before.

Why is VAR used in offside situations were you need even with a digital line several minutes to decide? This just sucks.

And what I don't get, we have a corner kick in the 88th minute and it was clear that there would be quite a bit of added time. Instead of going for the goal we try to keep the ball at the corner flag and win about twenty seconds with it. You can try this when it is the 92th minute but not so early in my mind, when you become so passive it's really dangerous.",glshwai,lb8fs5,borussiadortmund,2021-02-03 06:31:52,ProfDumm,23

But Gio? Didn't attempt a single pass in behind, didn't press, a goddamn corpse would have had a better body language! All he did was slouch over the pitch.

"After the game I went for a nice walk and ate some food to clear my head, then I rewatched most of the game (would not suggest). I just couldn't understand what happened after the first 20mins that we went from looking so good to absolute garbage. 

My key take-aways: Maybe we didn‚Äôt actually go to complete garbage.

1. Paderborn played very hard, they really ran hard at our team the entire game and we just shut down it seems like for multiple 10 min sections. Huge props to their team and manager, they gave it their whole heart.

2. Our midfield giving away simple passes/unforced errors in terrible positions. Seems to be a recurring issue in games recently. We have to fix this now, it's up there with our terrible set piece defending. 

3. Lack of direct play, this one really frustrates me, we seem perfectly happy to try long balls and hope to get in behind, but we refuse to make direct incisive forward passes into Haaland and Sancho. Not sure if this is a leave over from Favre but after watching 3-4 direct passes not even attempted in a row, I wanted to throw my computer across the room.

4. Delaney, Can, Haaland, and Sancho -  worked and ran so hard today I'm not sure how to play Can and Delaney best together but they deserve to be playing over any of our other midfielders right now.  

5. The ref was fine in the first half but the second half and extra time became a farce.

6. Our luck. I mean recently I feel like we've just had a lack of that luck with the game. I think partially this can be attributed to a lack of squad cohesion and tactics, hoping we get some luck back with us soon.

Can and Haaland joint MOTM I can't decide who deserves it more they both played their hearts out.",gltguut,lb8fs5,borussiadortmund,2021-02-03 11:09:19,LeeRCampbell,3

So why not try to change our play first. I mean look at the last game. The players know hitz isn‚Äôt a playmaking goaly so they don‚Äôt even force him to do so. Why not try that with b√ºrki, too?

"Our biggest project should be getting minimum TWO RBs in the summer. I still think it was wrong not buying a single RB this transferwindow, didnt need to be any toptalent or superstar. Just someone who solidly does his job. 5m‚Ç¨~

Meunier is clearly lacking the skills we need for his role. He is quite pace-y and is a workhorse which is decent.

Morey is technically good and is okay-ish at defending but his body is not made for football, EVERYTIME he gets his chance to start he gets injured within two weeks.

Passlack is just not good enough in all aspects. he needs to try get some playing time somewhere else tbh and well that's it.

Pisczu is going to retire and well no more players left. 

LB side also needs to be reworked hard. We have rapha that's it. Once he is injured/exhausted we are forced to play Schulz and nobody wants that.

Same could be said about CBs tbh. We have Hummels who is clearly our best then we have Akanji and DAZ. Akani is decent and DAZ also seems like he is injured regulary :(

What I do not understand is why Stieler takes the time to explain this shit during the game to Baumgart, when play has already been stopped for 5 minutes, instead of explaining it after the game to everyone (not Sky but state media is respectful to refs). Would have helped his cause and the publics perception of the situation immensly. Wouldn't even have to do it himself, just send a DFB guy that explains the matter - not sure why they can run a useless twitter account but not give clear statements after the game to clarify such complicated situations.

"Yesterday was a perfect example of why it sucks to be a referee. The decision not to call offsideon the 3:2 was 100% correct, yet Stieler is the one who gets shit on, while Baumgart gets celebrated for his PaShUn, which boils down to little more than an attempt to play the victim card.

Stieler makes the incredible difficult call with apparently very little help from VAR, who seemingly did not find the right angle to confirm there was a touch (which is also why there would have been little point in Stieler going to the sideline and looking at inconclusive footage). [There is conclusive footage](https://gfycat.com/insignificantanothergraywolf) that shows there was a touch, though it only appeared after the game.

That touch, which was a deliberate attempt by the Paderborn player to play the ball, means Haaland is no longer in a punishable offside position. You may think that is stupid, yet everyone who has been to a few referee courses will tell you it's how the rules work. Perfect call by Stieler.

And yet the imbeciles on ARD, *despite having the footage I linked above*, did not realize it. Half the people on here and r/soccer don't even know how the rule works. But everyone still feels entitled to shit on the ref.

This was necessary to meet the new debts caused by the Covid pandemic, with further debt necessary. Because of our overall healthy financial position new credit lines could be accessed at comparatively good conditions (below 2%).

I can see now why he was so confused with it.,gqtx97w,m4dams,borussiadortmund,2021-03-14 04:16:44,Tomayachi,21

"Happiness. 

Have a great fucking weekend everyone :D

Only concerns are Hummels and Reus injures. Hopefully nothing serious. Otherwise, great game. Brandt and Moukoko scoring is cherry on top.",gqtrio7,m4dams,borussiadortmund,2021-03-14 03:25:50,Ciao9,15
"It wasn't a vintage performance, but it was a solid collected showing to put away Hertha. The goalkeeping against Brandt's shot was a bit odd, but It was still fairly deserved since we'd already made a couple decent chances earlier in the game. Moukoko sealed the deal nicely after the Darida red card.

Just hope Mats &amp; Marco aren't hurt. They're vitally important to the team's cohesion right now.

Hertha will feel hard done, but this was a big 3 points to earn considering Leipzig will want to beat Frankfurt tomorrow and Leverkusen could drop points against Bielefeld. It's really good to see us wrap another one up against one of the struggling teams.

Is Brandt's goal enough to give him the MOTM on this one? Is there another option?

Edit: I also liked Morey's work today. It's nice to see him keeping his place regularly now.",gqtrp87,m4dams,borussiadortmund,2021-03-14 03:27:25,Nextgen101,11
"Great result. Hoping for a Brandt redemption arc but he still has to play well. Pretty worrying that we had pretty much 0 service to Haaland, a role that is hard to fill when Sanch is absent. Jude Bellingham is amazing and I love him already.",gqtrpab,m4dams,borussiadortmund,2021-03-14 03:27:26,statefarmdotcom,12

"Moukoko almost willed that ball into the goal.

I'm very happy for Julian. The guy tries his best. He needs to spend more time on his conditioning.

"Hopefully this gets Brandt's confidence up as Reus might have to miss a few games. Moukoko finally scores in a game we won.

Nightmare game for Jarstein.",gqts16h,m4dams,borussiadortmund,2021-03-14 03:30:17,asinine89,8
"We pretty much dominated the game, the scoreline seems about right to me considering some of the really difficult saves Jarstein made. Reus didn't look too bad after his injury so hopefully he'll be okay. Still would be good to rest him for a game though. Hummels I am more worried about as he didn't seem to have any contact directly before being subbed off, but he was also walking okay so hopefully it's just precautionary.

MotM for me is Bellingham again. He was incredible again today.

"Wasn‚Äôt the prettiest of games but got a much needed win. Hoping this is a changing point in positive direction for Brandt.

I love that Moukoko scored and almost assisted. All season long he has been subbed in at like the 80th minute yet he still shows his worth. We need to give him more minutes.

"So I just read another interpretation of the whole VAR sequence: The goal is disallowed BECAUSE the penalty was given. If the referees come to the decision that the foul was worthy of a penalty and there wasn't an immediate advantage, everything else after that is annulled. 

I do seem to remember that the little box in the corner of the screen first said something along the lines of ""VAR check for goal"" and then switched to ""VAR check for penalty"", but I don't know who controls that thing and what type of information that person gets from whom. 

If that were the case, my usually pretty positive opinion of VAR would be worsened considerably. I think this should be a type of extended advantage, where the later goal overwrites the earlier penalty shout (I think that is how it f.e. works in Rugby where there are several types of advantage and scoring a try is usually considered the ultimate advantage). Scoring goals is the primary obejctive of the game. There is nothing Dortmund gained from going back to the earlier infringement.

Does anyone know if UEFA puts out explanations for the various VAR decisions somewhere? I would be interested in the official explanation.",gqfeluc,m1hgkw,borussiadortmund,2021-03-10 16:53:29,meem09,2

"Under the motto ""Borussia connects"", Borussia Dortmund is committed to a diverse society and against all forms of discrimination. Main sponsor 1&amp;1 is also committed to diversity and tolerance with ""United in Diversity"". Together, BVB and 1&amp;1 will set a visible sign against discrimination at the match against FC Bayern Munich on Saturday (6.3., 6.30 pm). The players will be wearing a 1&amp;1 logo in rainbow colours on their jerseys. The captain's armband is also in rainbow colours.

At Borussia Dortmund, ""Borussia connects"" is the umbrella for numerous campaigns and initiatives. BVB has a long-term and continuous commitment to a diverse society and against all forms of discrimination. In the past, this included an event in memory of the homosexual victims of National Socialism as well as action match days against sexism and homophobia. BVB has also been involved in the recent CSD parades in Dortmund as well as in the European project ""OUT"", which strengthens the LGBTIQ* community in football. BVB is also a model location for the ""Diversity in the Stadium - Access, Protection and Participation"" project run by KoFaS gGmbH. In this project, measures are developed and implemented to make stadium attendance more inviting for LGBTIQ* fans and to make a diverse audience feel welcome. 

With the 1&amp;1 diversity logo on the chest of the BVB players, the partners want to send a clear signal for more diversity and equal opportunities. At the same time, they are convinced that diversity in terms of religion, gender, sexual orientation or origin enriches and helps to fully exploit potential. 

1&amp;1 promotes a cosmopolitan outlook and represents a broad diversity. The Group-wide initiative ""United in diversity"" is dedicated to diversity, which 1&amp;1 also stands for as part of the United Internet Group. With a variety of activities, including information platforms, event series such as the company-wide ""Diversity Days"", workshops and seminars, the company advocates more equal opportunities and diversity. 

The Federal Agency for Civic Education (Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung) has compiled information here for further discussion of the topic.

"Oof.. a lot to say but Im just gonna bullet-point like I usually do to not rant the whole thread into oblivion as if my opinion/takes are more important than anyone elses haha.

   - One of the worst reffing in Germany Ive seen in many years. Horrible from start to end. Missed like 5 clear yellows while the first yellow to  Dahoud was NEVER a yellow. Resulting in a red later on.
   - I REALLY hope we appeal for that red on Dahoud to be overturned based on the 1st yellow being horrible, if thats possible(?).
   - Dahoud was great today again imo!
   - Sancho with another solid game and goal!
   - Defense is seeming a lot more stable with Can CB rather than with Akanji honestly.
   - Morey just keeps improving, especially defensively.
   - Haalands finishing is a bit iffy lately imo. Goes for power a little too often when he should try to place it.
   - Hazard looked really solid when he got on. Love what he offers.
   - Fuck that Gladbach cunt who borderline clinched Bellingham with trashtalk as he was being subbed off.
   - EDIT: Have to add, Great game by Hitz. Some crucial saves and calm actions. Very pleased with his game today.

In general a quite ugly game and we were more defensively lined up with that 4-3-3 midfield. Not a fun game and also a very frustrating one. If Rapha is gone for a while, its also costly.

"I had to take a breather and talk with my friend that I was watching this game with before coming back here because that was getting a little too interesting for me at the end phew. We cut it pretty close , but it definitely would've been a lot easier if Reus or Haaland had finished their chances earlier on. I think we deserved to edge out Gladbach despite all of those nervy moments though.

I'm just glad we made it through and avoided extra time without suffering a black eye from our future coach in the process. Now it's time for a trip to Munich for the topspiel on Saturday. Get ready to circle back here in a few days for the rapid turnaround there!

Its funny how Bensabaini turns into Neymar whenever we meet. He's way too built to be acting like this and was shocking to see Stegeman allow it.

For G√∂tze there is always someone else at fault. He never reflects on his mistakes for example how he basically destroyed his own ahtleticism by getting more resilient. On the ball he is world class but his running speed and mobility is bush-league. Over the summer he got more into shape and is a bit more flexible now but where was that at Dortmund? At Dortmund he was satisfied with coasting by. No manager in the world will put such a player into a key role.,gw6mmoi,n0b407,borussiadortmund,2021-04-28 23:46:01,JSmellerM,29
"G√∂tze is genuinely very selfish and ungrateful.

"Okay there are several things wrong with your post. First of all he did not say that Favre didn't ask for PERFORMANCE. He said that despite his performance Favre saw now place for him, which makes sense. If the coach does not have a vacant position, it does not matter how hard you work.

f.e. would you bring the second keeper on as a striker, because he is the hardest working one? Probably not.

Secondly: There is literally no coach that has it all. There are coaches that are great in motivating, while they don't bring all that much tactical thinking to the table.

There might be coaches who can motivate, some who are making players better and some are tactic geniuses, but I only have 2 kinds: Those who make the team better than its pieces and the ones who don't.

S03+1 are the kid in class that you absolutely love to hate. You wouldn't bully them, you wouldn't  do anything to cause them actual harm, but you  absolutely love to loathe them and sabotage them in anyway possible.

Lawnball Sport is that rich kid that is just an annoying POS. You don't give them any time of day, are mean to them to their face, and try to expose all of their shitty, entitled behavior.

Leverkusen are the sad rich kid that are pathetic and lovable.

Wolfsburg are that kid you are pretty indifferent to, except when they are doing well, and then you are annoyed with them.

Hoppenheim are that kid who is annoying, who once punched you. That kid sucks, but most of the time, you don't really care. 

Bayern is the fucking bully who is loved by all the teachers, is a foot taller than you, and the star of every sports team. They are actually kind of a shitty person, but volunteer *all the time.* The teachers always give them good grades even though you turn in homework of similar quality. This is the type of person who is going to an Ivy league school after all, while you are headed to a state school. You hate their success, how much structural benefits they get, and how they are always assumed to be right, no matter what.

"If you really think Bayern is better than Schalke, you're clueless about the internal workings of football. Bayern tap up players not by talking but by paying them under the table, had a backdoor deal with a media company to get preferential treatment, threatened to quit for the serie a because they didn't get what they wanted. 

And these are just proven facts. It's insane how many calls they get their way from referees. Never, not once have I seen a referee screw over Bayern when they face us.

No club has benefited more from Schalke's misfortune than Bayern. Neuer, Goretzka with the latter coming for free. Sane, Choupo. They had Draxler on their radar too.

They've screwed us more than any other club. Taking G√∂tze derailed us until Mikhitaryan turned it on for his last year with us. Lewandowski went there for free and likely won them at least two titles considering we were so close in 2016 and 2019.

This is an unpopular opinion if you have a myopic view of football, live in the Ruhr and have seldom ventured out.

At least they're a real club with real fans. And Bayern constantly has fucked our squad and because of that dominated the league for a decade now. So much more to hate there than I'd find to hate in our neighbors.

And btw, a tiny 2 million loan with a high interest rate (that might only have been slightly lower than what he bank asked) is fucking nothing. It was a business decision for them. They talk about 'strong Bundesliga' but bought G√∂tze from us despite Guardiola specifically stating he doesn't want him. It was just to fuck us over.

50/50 for emotional disgust for them, and the dream of them stopping to win every game by default. Because even though i hate them with a passion I still gotta respect them rolling all over every club in  europe for years now.


Raba on the other Hand, i mean yes the marketing aspect sucks, and as some living close to kaiserslautern I would absolutely enjoy to swap Raba back for big clubs like FCK. 
But all the big clubs declining atm are also responsible for it for decades of structural mismanagement (HSV, schalke, 1860...)

And not only does Raba know how to finance a club, you also gotta admit they play nice football.
The whole mentality ""Fast young team players"" Is actual pretty attractive, footballwise. I sure know that that playstyle is a perfect marketing for an energydrink but still looks awsome when they have a good day, very similar to BvB 2011/2012/2013.

"What surprises me is the same amount of goals conceded and XG against despite apparently worse defensive stats overall. The defense seems to allow the opposition more freedom, yet they concede the same amount of goals. Though the lack of possession clearly impacts the attack

Terzic took over mid season after favre had basically lost the player‚Äôs confidence and was able to bring the team to where we are now: Qauterfinals in CL, still in the pokal, and still in the hunt for CL next year.

"Im defense of Favre, who seems to be seen as the one holding Dahoud back all these years in this thread, it was also a matter of formation and tactical decision. Back when we played either 4321 or 3atb Dahoud simply didn't fit the style. In Terzics first games where we played 4231 Dahoud didn't play either.

Him on a Pivot with Witsel never worked out and Dahoud/Delaney only ever worked against Bayern where different things where asked from our midfield.

The 433 we currently play suits him much better, especially with Bellingham alongside him and one of Can/Delaney covering the two. 

Dahoud has much more of a creating role now while not being the primary playmaker and doesn't have to worry nearly as much about all passes finding the target. A misplaced pass as one of the two 6 in Favres 4231 hurts way more than as the most forward positioned midfielder in a 433 where your two mates are constantly tracking back and forth.",gvws9l5,myrk6f,borussiadortmund,2021-04-26 16:56:26,Zhonyas4everyone,36

When he arrived, he reminded everyone of G√ºndogan who needed some 6 months to get into shape and then play well. When Dahoud didn't show the same development and actually regressed before improving slowly, a lot of people gave up on him.

However- let‚Äôs be honest here.... if Dortmund plays to their talent level, they are the 2nd best team in the bundesliga in my honest opinion.

"I admittedly misssed large chunks of the first half due to a phone call, but Wolfsburg always manages to look inexplicably blunt against us. At certain points, it felt like we had the man advantage over them after the red card. 

I was expecting to be pretty nervous today, but instead I feel like I just skipped all of that and jumped to the ending. Probably the weirdest 6-pointer I've watched in some time. üòØ

It was good to see Haaland get his mojo back with a brace and he seemed to enjoy his battle with Lacroix and Brooks too.

Another surprise today: With all the corners we faced and the defending we had to do in general, it's good that we didn't seem to miss Hummels too much. Hopefully the same thing will happen with Jude when we face Leipzig in a couple weeks, but he'll surely have a large role in the Pokal (vs. Holstein Kiel) match next weekend.

Dahoud MOTM.. I know everyones favorite Haaland did super with his goals but Dahoud was mental when we needed him the most. 

Reus also a MOTM contender.. dude did the defense of a LB and offense of a winger. Sensational lungs on him today.

Really bad decision by Jude that got him the red but the 1st yellow shouldnt be a yellow either. Nonetheless, he shouldnt be that reckless when on a yellow in a crucial game like this.

Oh.. and Piszu class again. Quiet but so so stable.

"Just rewatched the second yellow on Jude:

1. We should have never been in this situation up a goal (2 v 1 from the halfway line)
2. Emre with probably his most crucial Dortmund moment so far intercepting Baku's pass to the unmarked wolfsburg player. No Hitz hate but no confidence in him coming up with a big 1 vs 1 when the player has that much time and space.
3. Jude either saw Mbabu and decided to pull up or never saw him and was pulling up because he thought he had time but I think its the former.
4. He then sees Mbabu approaching and decides he needs to challenge for the ball after deceleration instead of just marking him. Fatal mistake but hopefully something that can get fixed with coaching. Even if you aren't on a yellow in that situation, once you pull up you've pulled out and there isn't any going back without a card.",gvqbpmn,mxm46u,borussiadortmund,2021-04-25 01:42:41,AllwhitelikeaRacist,1

"I know it sounds weird, considering the enormous transfer sum our board demands, but: Jadon is still so massively underrated by many people. There's so much hype about the Haaland vs Mbappe ""rivalry"", and people herald them to become the next Messi vs Ronaldo duo, but Jadon should really be in that conversation as well. Just now I checked some player stats on Fbref, and guess who's listed as having the most similar stats to Lionel Messi? That's right, Jadon Sancho. *Despite Jadon's mediocre start to the season.*

I genuinely think Jadon's smartest career move would be to stay one more season with us, play an entire season in the form he's currently in, and then leave to his dream destination with only a year left to his contract. And so far, him and his agent have a track record of smart career moves.",gvdmd27,mvoyj6,borussiadortmund,2021-04-22 06:25:23,zweiter_mensch,31

Now, I personally don't expect them to receive fines or be banned from the CL or anything like that, but there at least is a stench about them for the foreseeable future and I kind of wonder if there is a bit of hesitation by these young men who are very concious of their global image, to go to one of those clubs in a few months time.

Additionally, aren't those clubs a bit more hesitant now for at least a few months to go and buy players for 120 million+?

"Bullet-point coachanalysis from me today, sorry to plague you with it:


1. First time in many where I dont feel scared about our right side defensively. Piszu is just quietly class. Noone should think he  retires because he doesnt cut it anymore. 

2. Reyna looking good today again, great to see.

3. Can definitely in the wrong headspace. Fucking up things that are usually his strengths and visibly secondguessing most actions.

4. Reus still performing great. What a resurgence he's having. Amazing defensive workrate too.

5. Haaland need to calm the fuck down and learn some discipline in his finishing. Going full power and pray its on target is not gonna be enough in every scenario. I know he's 20 and he's a fucking stud. But that doesnt make him immune to criticism. (EDIT: [Edin is a proper man-manager](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ezh1Oj-XEAUC5tl?format=jpg&amp;name=large) )

6. Sancho didnt skip a beat lol. Looked as good as he did before he got injured. Beautiful to see.

Sadly, Hummels is out with suspension. Reus came in clutch today. We'll need someone to do that again on the Saturday trip for sure.

MOTM for me is Reus today, but it was a big relief to see Sancho back on the pitch again. Bringing in Dahoud and Brandt added great qualities too. 

Edit: Hopefully Haaland can get back amongst the goals very soon though because we need some of those clear chances he had to be buried. It gets so tense and nervy at the end otherwise.",gvd6ezr,mvojuj,borussiadortmund,2021-04-22 04:26:43,Nextgen101,13

"Just rewatched the second goal and watching it live, I thought Brandt was tweaking going to Guerrero because Sancho had more space around him but its really a brilliant move because he takes out the defender who would have come across to pressure sancho after his first touch. The keeper is already off his line so unless Sancho's first two touches were perfect it would have gone.

"Statement on the discussion about the introduction of a Super League

Borussia Dortmund's Chief Executive Officer, Hans-Joachim Watzke, commented on the discussion about the introduction of a European Super League on Monday morning.

""The members of the Board of the European Club Association (ECA) met in a virtual conference on Sunday evening and reaffirmed that the Board's decision of last Friday is still valid,"" Watzke said, adding, ""This decision states that the clubs want to implement the planned reform of the UEFA Champions League. It was the clear opinion of the members of the ECA board that they reject the plans to create a Super League."" 

Watzke also stressed that ""both German clubs represented on the ECA Board, FC Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, had 100 percent congruent views in all discussions.""

And practically they let the possibility open to joint at some point. I really hope that BVB stand by the traditions and values of this sport and this club and will never accept something like the super League. But I fear financially and competitively it is too promising to join it at some point.

Will clubs become icons, whereby their identity is projected onto them by fans, rather than actual, true documentation of that's club history?

As it is now, a club's history and identity is passed down generation by generation.  BVB is still seen as a blue collar, working town's club.  With the Super League teams, those clubs are only going to identified by financial records and trophies.

19.04.2021 - Joint statement by DFL and DFB on the situation in European football:

German football, DFL Deutsche Fu√üball Liga and Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund (DFB), has noted the establishment of a Super League with great shock. We stand in solidarity with UEFA and President Aleksander Ceferin. At the same time, we support all countermeasures announced by FIFA and UEFA, but also by the national leagues and associations concerned. We are aware that this could also affect the appointment of German national players under contract with Super League clubs.

This is about the future of football as a popular sport - and about setting a course the likes of which we have never experienced before. We must not allow the financial interests of a few top clubs from England, Italy and Spain to cause the abolition of tried and tested structures. Football in Europe also thrives on the fact that it is theoretically possible for every club to compete with the best on the continent. This dream must not be replaced by an almost closed society. National leagues are the basis for professional football, its popularity and its radiance throughout society. It is irresponsible and unacceptable to jeopardise the togetherness that has grown up over time. This togetherness is what has enabled the top clubs to grow in the past decades. We agree with the overwhelming majority of clubs, leagues and associations in Europe. Fans all over Europe are also raising their voices on this issue.

Against this background, it was also right that the UEFA Executive Committee today unanimously approved the planned reform of the European club competitions. This reform was an offer to the top clubs to come together under the common UEFA umbrella after all - and in some places a painful compromise. This offer was rejected for an obvious motivation. Football - at whatever level - has always been strong when it has found joint solutions. The DFL and DFB will do their utmost to achieve this more than ever. Also and especially in view of the worldwide Corona crisis, it should be clear what football should stand for with its values: solidarity instead of egoism.

Uefa President Ceferin does not spare clear words in the direction of the 12 Super League clubs at the press conference just underway: ""I was a defence lawyer for 24 years, but I never met people like that."" Agnelli was the ""biggest disappointment"".
Ceferin continued: ""I have never met anyone who lied so often and so continuously.""
Ceferin also makes it clear: the clubs and players who participate in the #superleague will be excluded from all Uefa and Fifa competitions. However, he can't quite say yet how this will work under EU competition law.

ESL is just another case that shows why we need stronger financial fairplay: A club should not be able to build up a staggering amount of debt. When that happens and investments go wrong, the clubs become puppets of their lenders.

The clubs' greed becoming apparent to everyone now has already existed in the form of taking on debt and buying superstar players ‚Äî¬†these unsustainable actions brought them in the situation where we are now.

"Nothing went our way over both legs. We faced a strong team with a great manager, but you can't help but feel salty about Judes goal first leg, the multiple iffy refereeing decisions today, and the shoddy luck we've had in general. Not to mention the unfortunate accidents made by Emre over both legs. Such a shame. 

There are some real criticisms about how we played. 

* We were struggling to quickly bring the ball out of the back with the time we had remaining. 

* I think Haaland lacked direction. I get that Man City kept him quiet, but I don't think Terzic did enough to get him involved in attack in some other way; Erling is one of our best assets and both legs, we failed to get him involved more than a handful of times. 

* Emre Can needs to bounce back too. He's a good player but series of crucial mistakes has got to hurt.

* Hitz :/

But we also balled out at times and there were a bunch of good takeaways from our games against city.

* First of all, that energy in the first half was contagious. Fucking love it. Celebrating on defense. The general passion in the players eyes. I was happy and feeling alright at half time, sadly things changed, but we were the better team for more of the tie than the aggregate score says, IMO. 

* Jude is incredible. Never thought I'd see him be such a staple in our team this soon in his time here. Mature. Energetic. Fiery. Composed. Absolute baller. 

* Akanji has been really solid and his ability to ping the ball long like Hummels is a fantastic trait. He's put in a proper shift.

I find it hard to say who which players are just underperforming this year, but can contribute to future success, and who are the ones that are deadweight and we should cut our losses with.

When it comes to the rest of our younger contingent I‚Äôd love to say that I think Morey, Knauff, Reyna, Moukoko, Tigges and Brandt will tear Europe a new asshole next season. I pray to see that happen but honestly I‚Äôm not fully convinced by any of them yet.

"The key to beating City is to get the advantage early then back off onto 20-30 meters from your goal and make them beat you in the small amount of space you give them. Of course it takes a massive and perfect effort from both the defense and the offense, and it takes a small amount of luck as well but the more you hold onto the lead, the more frustrated they become. Guardiola has lost ties this way like 3-4 times since his Bayern days and he still could not have figured out a perfect solution for teams doing this against them. 

After the first half I thought we were gonna take them to the final 10 minutes, we looked really good. Had the advantage, defended perfectly, also had the luck, and even though they had their chances, they weren‚Äôt as precise as they usually are, hell even KDB was a bit sloppy here and there. The second half started off just as well but then a small mistake of Emre gave them the relief they needed and after that they had the game in their hands. The corner combination before the second goal was by the way the same they attempted in the first half, but then Hummels read it perfectly and rushed at Foden before he could shoot. The defense missed this at the second time.

But fair enough, fought hard and both results were fine. Honestly expected a lot less from this tie, I think the boys managed to make 99% out of the two matches. That 1% would have been holding onto the lead at least a bit longer today.",gujogq5,mqzs0t,borussiadortmund,2021-04-15 07:30:06,Billofrights_boris,7

Can's penalty was unlucky, but I think the right call. Ball bounced off his head and hit his arm, but his arm was stretched out a lot.

Shitty feeling like last year allowing City to break their UCL curse.

The moment he's subbed for Reyna, our entire right wing goes to absolute shit and Foden/Cancelo start having their way with an essentially defenseless Morey, prompting other players to cover him and opening spaces in the center.

"Rapha is great but Hummels still is too. He is a top 3 CB in the league and I'd like the club to re-sign him for another season with an option for the following one. Can surprised me I gotta admit, before he was announced I was in the camp being against his transfer because I said what do we need him for and he isnt that good anyway but he proved me wrong. He works in a two CB formation as well and is our 2nd best. So the only problem we have is RB. Meunier is shit and I still dont get the thought process of Susi to sign him. Yeah he's a veteran and can help the young guys out and lead like Hummels but he doesn't deserve to be on the pitch which shouldn't surprise anyone since he was already utter shit for PSG. I didn't make my mind up yet about Morey. He's always putting effort in but is sometimes clueless what to do. He's still a bit raw and has to struggle with injuries constantly so I give him the benefit of a doubt for next season.

Regarding Sancho we have to come to terms we're gonna lose him this summer because this is the last opportunity where we can dictate the fee and I think another season for him after not getting his move would be too hard for him. As for Haaland I'm prolly with you, losing both in one window would be too much and I doubt we get an instantly functioning replacement, also clubs would fleece us with all the money we have. Will be a difficult enough challenge to replace Sancho and I wouldn't count my money on Reus and Brandt to do the job for us.",gtcf1mq,mjvhoa,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 21:19:54,47Lecht,30

"Hummels is very very good but his lack of pace is starting to catch up to him. Get Maignan for 25m, Lacroix for 30 million, and Loic Bade for however much he costs.

He's a 25 year old morey who probably won't improve much more. Idk who to get for that position but we have to sell meunier and have someone else compete with morey. Sell schulz to whoever is willing to pay and get a leftback decent enough to let us play Guereiro in midfield or cover for him when he's injured. I think our midfield is fine, we don't need to sign another fucking midfielder we're stacked. We then need to sign 2 wingers and a striker. We could sign depay, but he'll probably end up at barca. We should sign Mallen and go for orsic (although I think this one might be unlikely), and then any decent winger who's good enough to play backup. We then give moukoko more minutes and hope by the end of the season he's able to play the majority of minutes.

"Try to see it the opposite way, instead of focusing on the loss of quality with Sancho or Harland, what we would gain the chance to build a team with a more flat hierarchy, we're you don't need to read any transfer rumors on r/soccer every week.

I really think that the current team can simply not absorb the quality of these players, because the fundamentals are not there. The game against Frankfurt was a perfect example, we just don't have the needed focus to complete our attacks.

I want the core of the team to absolutely look at BVB as the dream club they want to play at in good and in bad times. That sounds cheesy, but it's just not the case for Harland and Sancho. Regardless of age or quality, the team for next season needs to be stripped of its distracting factors.

I know he hasn't been good enough in the PL, but he has been scoring recently for Belgium and that would be enough for me to splash the 10-15mill (anyone know how much he would be?) that he will cost. If anything, he will be a good impact/backup striker, something we are clearly lacking.

"Selling both is a great way to speed up the train in the direction of our neighbors from GE. Problem is the club is trending in the wrong direction so it isn't likely we will be able to keep both long term. In that case you move Sancho to give Moukoko a year to develop with Haaland still here. In this case I'm re-investing all of that fee into two players to replace his production. Complete hypothetical but something like 70m to Tottenham for a guy like Son and then 30-40m to Eindhoven for a guy like Mallen. You have the immediate replacement in Son and a guy with some flexibility like Mallen to play at striker or inside forward.

Ideally we'd extend Sancho and just let Haalands release clause get hit next year but I just don't see Sancho extending here with no CL, and the way we're trending.",gtdm58i,mjvhoa,borussiadortmund,2021-04-05 03:44:00,AllwhitelikeaRacist,1
"while the defense hasn't been great this year, it's interesting how much focus it gets as compared to the offensive underperformance. xG isn't a perfect stat, but dortmund has the fourth lowest total of xGa this season (31.4) while giving up 39 goals. that absolutely means they need a new goalkeeper, but i think the defensive problems have also been shaped by some bad luck with opponents hitting screamers outside the box. (which, in turn, is made possible by subpar goalkeeping.) it's more complicated than that and i could write several more paragraphs, but to be the larger problem has been an offense that could and should be even more dangerous.

the xG generated this season has been about 54, with just 55 goals scored. the best teams in europe always overperform xG because they have players who overperform, and that was true for dortmund under favre until this year began. i think it would've corrected itself over time if favre had remained, as he had the tactical acumen to figure it out and continue putting players in the right places, something terzic isn't able to do (and shouldn't have been asked to). but imagining what another 7-10 goals sprinkled in throughout the season would've done to this team's overall positioning is hard to overestimate.

to bring this back to your point: the offense should be better under a new coach, and the defense could be, too. i think you could see some renaissance seasons from defenders with a new goalkeeper and a fairly stable attack ‚Äî if Haaland or Sancho goes, then you reinvest in attack and midfield more than defenders, and get back to outscoring opponents with some admission that goals will be conceded. i could probably make this argument more cohesively with more time, but i just think it's interesting how the the offense vs. defense perceptions hs developed this year, and i'm very nervous what both sancho and haaland leaving would do.",gtgusnv,mjvhoa,borussiadortmund,2021-04-06 00:19:28,tim_cato,1

"Probably would be a full rebuild this summer

Haaland and sancho maybe(or probably) going so we will probably need replacements there.

Reus is showing signs of age and the results of countless injuries. Reyna looked capable of replacing him but hasn't looked good since favre got fired. Brandt came out of form in the preseason and well didn't exactly improve and only got worse.

Probably a new keeper

Hummels is aging,pisczek is gone and akanji is underrated but is replacable

Big zag is made out of glass so probably will get replaced sooner or later

Witsel is getting older and is coming from a big injury.

We have a lack of wingers but knauff is a promising prospect to get more playing time

Our midfielders don't gel well but Can being a 6 again can possibly help(?). Prefer him over delaney there but our best midfielders this season,mo and bellingham are too offensive as a combination to play alone as dms.

Our rb/rwb position is a mess . Morey has shown improvements throughout the season but hasn't exactly been a game changer and when your competition is meunier,it's easy to look good.

We need a schulz replacement too maybe as he is maybe too erratic. No one will take him tho because of his wages. I like him tho,he hustles but his quality is more of a 2nd backup.",gtc9gdc,mjr6df,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 20:12:36,joshdej,7

Mike Maignan: French goalkeeper aged 25. Very highly rated and experienced.

Nikola Milenkovic: A young yet highly rated CB from Fiorentina. Not the quickest CB but one of the other choices would go great with him. Good in the air and very strong. His team isn‚Äôt doing very well, so that might bump his price down to around ‚Ç¨20-25M

Cristian Romero: 22 year old CB who‚Äôs been popping off this season. Atalanta are a team that usually depend on out scoring opponents but he‚Äôs still been an inform player. He‚Äôs quick (good compliment to Milenkovic) and very good on the ball. ‚Ç¨20M tops for him

"Should come as no surprise, but given the rampant speculation this deserves some more visibility imo. Key statement: ""We had a clear and open discussion and our position is clear. We're planning with Haaland.""

On Thursday there was already [a similarly clear statement](https://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/bvb/team-haaland-in-barcelona-bvb-bosse-schliessen-wechsel-in-diesem-sommer-aus-plus-1620515.html): ""Independent of how we do this season he will definitely not leave this summer"".",gta1dsl,mjg5aa,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 04:10:53,panikpansen,18
"IMO, the best that could happen for the team and the fans in the long run is to sell both Haarland and Sancho at the end of the season, even if that means not getting what we initially planned.

There are two reasons, why they are don't help us overall to achieve our goals. First, constantly knowing that basically that both of them have their big club targets in mind prevents crucial development. Building link up play with the precision we need is just not going to happen if you feel like you need to rush your development.

We are light-years away from the proper link up and precision that we can see from M√ºller-Lewandowski ore even what we see from Leipzig at the moment. You will only get there if trust comes from all sides, and if Fans, team mates, agents, newspapers do nothing else but talk about your next big step, you simply won't invest the hard work mentally that is required to get to the precision in offense that is needed to beat any team in the Bundesliga.

We essentially have a few very high value assets, but none of them integrate beyond very basic combinations, it is actually very sloppy we play for quite a while now.

I think we need a hard reset, by removing the outliers both to the top and the bottom of the team. The whole BVB ecosystem needs to reunite around quality buildup play that we have seem in the past, only then we can integrate World class players properly.",gtbu3x3,mjg5aa,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 16:04:09,meinstream,12

"Just got done watching the game, got my first covid shot this morning during the match and decided to watch it afterwards.  Argh. 

Frustrating to say the least. I haven‚Äôt followed BVB  very long, maybe 18 months... but it‚Äôs easy to see morale hasn‚Äôt been strong the past few weeks.

Hazard had some terrible passes today, normally I don‚Äôt critique too much but he was poor in form.  I‚Äôd certainly like to see Haaland move around more and try to be a play maker a bit instead of standing around and waiting for the ball to be fed to him. 

Also, it‚Äôd be nice to see a better mentality from him rather than ‚ÄúF this bullspit.‚Äù He‚Äôs putting so much pressure on himself and flailing his arms when things don‚Äôt go his way. Perhaps that‚Äôs the maturity of a pressure filled 20 year old?

I fully believe the standings would be different if they played in front of full crowds. 

But as frustrating as it is watching them lose, they‚Äôre still our team. They need us backing them! It seems like next few years might be different if we lose a few players, but it creates opportunity for others. Heja BVB!",gt9nrl4,mjan57,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 02:17:32,seang91,6
"So to get this right, we require a new goalkeeper, consistent CB to cover for Zagadou being injury prone and Hummels being older, a new right back, two wingers so we don't have to rely on Hazard to be our only true winger when Sancho leaves (Knauff, Hazard, 2 wingers brought in this summer with 1 on 1 abilities), at least one striker to replace Haaland, and potentially a midfield signing to replace Witsel if he isn't anywhere near his pre injury quality.

At least selling Sancho and Haaland should bring in a lot of money this summer, but the real question is how much of that money the club will be willing to invest into the team. We need quality players who aren't too old, and quality players under the age of 30 with Champions League quality (willing to play for a Europa League team) seems like a long shot this summer.",gt9xfox,mjan57,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 03:37:08,Bosna1909,6

"Absolutely disappointing game...it‚Äôs gonna be very unlikely that we can make CL now.

All in all a poor game in terms of end product, even though we looked the better team for most of the game. I was rather disappointed with Terzic‚Äôs subs, apart from the first one of Dahoud for Bellingham which I thought was good. Schulz actually had decent play sometimes when he used his pace to bring the ball up, although his own goal was poor defending for sure. I feel like Rapha was really tired by 75min and should have been the one off for Reyna or Brandt, although Reus did run a lot too. Not so sure about bringing in the likes of Reinier when we desperately need a goal though...but of course it‚Äôs easy to say the subs weren‚Äôt optimal in hindsight I guess. 

It does feel like we don‚Äôt have the required quality on the bench though, especially with Sancho out and Hazard struggling to find form we are really lacking quality wingers. If Haaland has to go in summer so be it tbh, if it means we get the cash needed for a replacement and some good players in other positions.",gt9616o,mjan57,borussiadortmund,2021-04-03 23:44:47,Je455,4

"We need more attacking firepower. Halaand is really our only consistent goal threat. In my honest opinion, I wouldn't mind seeing a trio of Knauff, Moukoko, and Halaand. At least they are direct and inject life and pace into our play. Players like Reus are just too passive.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Halaand, his body language was horrible since the first half. He is our best player and all but he is not above the team. We needed more from him today when it came to both scoring and mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, as the season goes, on its becoming clear who the deadweight in the team are. Schulz, Meunier, Brandt, and Reinier are really not the players we need at this club. Maybe throw Akanji in there too since so many people seem to think so. Reus still has value but he needs to be more impactful in games if he wants to continue starting. All he does in game is miss two in the box opportunities and maybe create 2 good chances. He's kind of null the whole rest of the game.",gt98atv,mjan57,borussiadortmund,2021-04-04 00:04:45,Trojan_Man68,4

A lot of good points made in the thread I can't really add much to at the moment.

Rafa Benitez was there available. Whether 6 months or a Tuchel at Chelsea type deal.

"something I think I'll always be part of the minority is that I actually like the relegation playoff (and no, not only because it is saving K√∂ln).   
  
yes, I understand it is harsh to the smaller teams that can see a legit effort of a whole season end fruitless because of two matches (and the other way around), and yes too, both systems like that of the English Championship or those that have only direct promotion and relegation (like it used to be) also have their legit advantages and appeal. However, I love to have a meaningful match after the league (and cup) ends, and a final chance of either getting promoted or saved, by itself, has *a lot* of appeal.  
  
maybe it can be perfected, make it single leg, make it a broader playoff like the English one, but to scrap it? no, it is something good to have.

If we can manage to find a great fit RB while adding St:Juste and whats likely to be Kobel, we've done really solid business in the defensive end imo. The dream #1 targets?

after a complicated, exhausting and in the end ""thank God"" successful season I decided together with the national coach not to go to the European Championship.  
This decision was very difficult for me, because I am always full of pride when I can play for my country.  
But after a very intense year for me personally and achieving my goals at BVB , I came to the decision to give my body time to recover!  
I will use the break wisely to start the new season in the best possible way!  
I wish Jogi and our team all the best for the European Championship and as a fan I will be cheering along and keeping my fingers crossed...

Hummels and Can are in the Euro squad. Gutted for Dahoud. Was so amazing for us. But I think he wouldn't be in the playing XI anyways. Overall nice squad for Germany. Volland got a deserved call up.

"I know it's a little bit early, but what kind of transfers are you hoping for, for this summer? 

I personally don't want to change much, team has shown it's got quality. 

TL;DR: We need a new GK, another CB, RB and a winger for rotation. I'd personally only sell Burki, Meunier and maybe Witsel (only because we might have too many players in the midfield positions). 

From the goalkeeper standpoint, Burki needs to go imo, Hitz should be satisfied as a replacement. We don't need a top 5/top 10 gk, just someone consistent and not prone to mistakes. 

LB - I'd keep things as they are, Rapha #1 and Shulz as a backup is perfect for me.

CB- We need someone new, Hummels is showing his age, Zaga is injured too much, one more guy for the future.

RB- As much as I wanted to like Meunier I think he should go and we need a new quality RB. Morey as a backup is fine, Passlack as a backup for both sides also I think is great. 

In the midfield I wouldn't change anything, just enough players for rotation. Maybe I'd be willing to let go of Witsel if we ""have to"" sell someone. 

I do think we need a another winger for rotation, hell maybe even two. We've had problems recently where wingers are getting tired in 60th, or 70th minute but we lack quality subs.

In the striker positions, Haaland, Moukoko and Tigges are also great.",gyk0990,ne95pu,borussiadortmund,2021-05-18 19:11:31,duNksteN,5

What a relief. üòå

I'm very glad to see these big tasks completed after some extremely tough months before and after the winterpause. We really rallied our form after that Frankfurt defeat a couple months ago.

We looked really good in the first half, but after that massive deluge at halftime, everything slowed down, especially on our end. I wasn't really that worried besides a few minutes around the 60th when B√ºrki had to make that big save. Their keeper was forced into a save shortly afterwards though and then it felt a bit more comfortable again by the time our third goal came. It would have been pretty solid overall if not for the penalty consolation at the end.

I would give Reus MOTM again today. He's looking really sharp and it's good to see him finishing the season strong and healthy!

to me, the success under terzic has come from playing relatively simple football and trusting the squad's overall talent. that's smart! the players have been given so much freedom in the past weeks, and because they're far and away the most talented team in the bundesliga not named bayern, it's worked.

but the team's loss of shape in the pokal final's second half is exactly what a tactically minded coach like rose should help with. we still aren't quite talented enough to compete with bayern and in europe without a structure that accentuates the players and helps them play above the sum of the parts. i'm optimistic rose can do that because they're already playing \*this\* good now.",gy413cr,nc2g9z,borussiadortmund,2021-05-14 23:44:51,tim_cato,19

"Erst, Reus ist mein capitan! 

He was involved in 3 goals and almost set up another with Toto. Man of the Match for sure.

I can't believe how clinical we were in the first half and going one better than the first half on Saturday was a big boon to us. If Leipzig had been as clinical in the second half as we were in the first.... phew. That 30+ minute stretch in the second was absolutely nerve-wracking after we'd been coasting early on.

I'm just glad it's over now. üòÖ

"the last 15 months were really difficult for me... I struggled with many issues concerning education, my job, and my personal life. Last spring was the worst time of my life due to terrible work conditions and the resulting lack of motivation, self-hatred bc I didn't stand up to my employer, topped off by anxiety and loneliness due to the Covid situation. I climbed out of this metaphorical pit. Lost one of my closest friends, but deepened other friendships. This Pokal victory means so much to me.  I can't wait to play football again myself. Maybe it's naive to say this, but I feel like things in my life are going to get better again.

"MY unrealistic wet-dream summer window(not including Meunier &amp; Schulz replacing tho):

1. Haaland and Sancho stays.

2. Burki sold. Zagadou(Love him but literally just costing us cash at this point) sold.

3. Madueke, an RB, Maignan, Lacroix bought. Onana if not Maignan. 

4. Piszu &amp; Schmelle gets a proper fan farewell early next season, even if they just travel back for it. TIFOs or something would be amazing. At the same time Haaland and Sancho gets to enjoy the fans properly again too. 


Then if things go well.. maybe start planning to replace Meunier &amp; Schulz in the January window at the earliest, next summer at the latest. Gudmundsson could be an interesting LB option that wouldnt cost a lot, whos we've already been reported to monitor. 


PSA: Again.. MY WET-DREAM UNREALISTIC scenario. Im well aware of the unrealism of all this happening.

I was originally a skeptic of Terzic but I'm really starting to like him. It seems like he has a closer relationship with the players so there is less static between player and coach. The players were not happy playing under Favre.,gxk9xmn,n8l60w,borussiadortmund,2021-05-10 10:03:29,Trojan_Man68,11

"First of all: I like Terzic, he's a good coach and you can tell how invested he is in the team/the club.  
But I am not convinced that he'd be a better choice for next season than Rose. We had many games that we should have won on paper, there was the almost do-or-die-game against Frankfurt that we lost and many games that were way closer than they should have been. Much of the improvement in the last weeks coincided with the knowledge of the Rose-transfer, which must have taken a lot of pressure from Edins shoulders.",gxl7fnr,n8l60w,borussiadortmund,2021-05-10 17:04:35,cashman5,9

Plus when Favre was fired, Rose was on fire with BMG. Hindsight is always 20/20.

"Mainz is an interesting team tactically. They are counter attacking team and their midfield is just there to break up play, they play inverted wingers up top and have an industrious CAM behind them. They press as 3-4-3 but the most dangerous players attacking wise are the fullbacks and their CAM, they foul relentlessly, or press harshly, get the ball to their inverted wingers or CAM or WBs and run.

Mo will be very important here, but the most important thing would be to foul ourselves like how Pep's teams do it off the ball, preventing their counterattacking. Also we should practice attacking set pieces for that game.",gxi8fsa,n88qvb,borussiadortmund,2021-05-09 23:34:33,InexorableWyrd,6

Also.. conceding from corners zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.


1 thing I gotta mention.. people were shitting on Terzic reactionairily because he subbed of Dahoud but Dahoud was on the sidelines talking to Terzic just a few min before the sub. I think he picked up a knock or something.

"Subbing out Dahoud totally changed the dynamic of the second half in my opinion. We looked pretty dreadful for a huge portion of time after he left the pitch. Would have much preferred Delaney in for Can since he was making some questionable runs with the ball and risked losing possession in some very precarious positions. Would have also like to see Knauff in for Reyna in the 70th rather than after 80 since Reyna looked absolutely gassed at 70 lol.

Sancho is just ridiculous. Rapha wasn't shooting too hot today, but his passing was pretty good and he came up huge in the end. Reus has been spectacular the past few weeks. Hummels is still a great defender and still surprisingly records some quick sprint speed during the games but man did he look absolutely burned a few times out there today. 

Really starting to like Hazard more and more as time goes on. I have to admit I used to think he sort of disappeared at times, but not having him during his injury cycle made me realize how much we missed having someone like him out there.",gxeafh2,n7rhxn,borussiadortmund,2021-05-08 23:38:18,biggieBpimpin,6

"What a game. I think the thing we can take out of this game more than anything is the mindset that the team as developed since March. That the game ends only when the whistle blows, and that it‚Äôs never too late to make up for previous defensive errors. We showed again that we do in fact have a back up plan for when Haaland can‚Äôt play, and I think Red Bull practiced their game for Haalands sort of attacking where it‚Äôs just power through the middle, they couldn‚Äôt deal with us breaking through the flanks. Sancho looked so ecstatic with his goals, a good omen for the future.

As for the conceded goals, at least for the first, I may be in the minority when I say that Burki could have in fact done a little better on it. I said on the game thread that he started well and did a Burki, and some people got really pissed off at me for it. I didn‚Äôt mean any disrespect towards him at all, but I still stand by the fact that the way in which the goal was conceded was very characteristic of how Burki has dealt with set pieces in the past, and it was especially sad since he did start off very well despite his absence. Communication was the first thing that went wrong. Klostermann was clearly badly marked before the corner, and he was directly in Romans sight, which meant he could‚Äôve at least said something, unless he did and I just didn‚Äôt notice. Burki did very well to close off the right side of the goal since that was where the player was, it would have been difficult to direct the header towards the left anyway so it was smart play by him, and heading it towards the center would also be difficult due to the angle at which Klostermann jumped at, it probably would have went over. However Burki sort of Stuttered when the ball was placed towards the right, he looked like he was going to dive for it but sort of stopped. He‚Äôs done it quite a lot with set pieces, and although he wouldn‚Äôt have guaranteed a save with a dive, I still think he should have stuck with his first decision to instinctively reach for the ball anyway. The second goal wasn‚Äôt on him, it was just poor defending, but I do feel that a little more could have been done with that first. He still did very well today, showing that he‚Äôs been training hard and isn‚Äôt lacking in fitness whatsoever.

We got 2 down for the season, let‚Äôs go for the treble of wins against RaBa for the cup, HEJA BVB!!!",gxeau18,n7rhxn,borussiadortmund,2021-05-08 23:41:41,ahmed_a20,2

"Pulisic always had and still has some very valuable qualities for teams, but as other people have mentioned, he was at times frustrating to watch.  What made him good for us is also what made him frustrating.  He‚Äôs a very direct player.  I think that‚Äôs also why Tuchel kept saying ‚ÄúI know what he can bring from the bench.‚Äù  He‚Äôs not the type of player that necessarily make coaches feel very secure when the game is at 0-0 in the first half, because he can needlessly lose the ball at time, but when you‚Äôre chasing a result and you need to up the risk, he‚Äôs excellent.

"The stats don't lie. I personally still think Pulisic was/is the better player. In trying to justify that to myself I kind of reached the conclusion that Pulisic is a better individual player. Has more technical ability/flair. His highs are higher than Reyna. BUT Reyna is a better team player, he molds himself to those around him being that selfless player. But as such I think Reyna is only as good as those around him and does not have individual sparks. If that makes sense. I'm not trying to bash Reyna because I think depending on your team and more so in too tier teams you want a Reyna over a Pulisic. Someone who unlocks their teammates.

He really is fullfilling his Potential especially under Terzic and didnt really had a bad Game since the First Game against Stuttgart. 
Our Defensive still isnt perfect but im much more Confident in Akanji and Hummels then i was in our Defense in a long time.",gwu7shw,n3n16r,borussiadortmund,2021-05-04 06:38:38,bvbfan102,1
Very tough but it has to be Haaland. He turned the season around for us.,gwucyk2,n3n16r,borussiadortmund,2021-05-04 07:18:58,daggers1g,1
"I'd have to give it to Haaland, hands down. And I have given this alot of thought, it was not an easy decision.
My reasoning is as follows: 

He has been an invaluable asset to us in a very tough season marred with many blunders and at times seemingly unrelentingly stiff competition. He has consistantly scored (very often gorgeous) goals, and often he has done it basically solo, even if the passes and flanks were godawful and would have been useless to others, he took them and turned them into displays of individual brilliance. 

Now the question remains: Well what about the phase he had where he didn't score?
Well, in those matches he nearly always played an instrumental part of the goals scored. Despite being a figurehead of our team, he is always a team player, he does not play selfish or for his own glory, but to win and he usually takes the right decisions with the ball. 

Also let's not forget that when he was not injured (which besides, you can't hold against him bc that's nothing he can control) he has basically been on the pitch for the full match in every. Single. Match. AND hasn't showed any sign in slowing down in the effort and performance he brings to the pitch. 

A close second for me would be Jude Bellingham just because he has absolutely blown me away with his hunger and preparedness to chase every single ball (at times almost too much so lol) What he is able to consistently perform is just mind blowing to me. Age does not play a factor in this evaluation as that would be unfair to others, but it deserves a mention at least. He really embodies the spirit of the club, as does Haaland. Malochen! Sich f√ºr den Klub zerreissen und alles geben f√ºr den BVB! (work your ass off and give everything for the Club) We might not have advanced against Sevilla if it wasn't for Jude Bellingham, BUT, we probably wouldn't have even played against Sevilla if it wasn't for Haaland.

There's a reason we are where we are, and why we still have a very good chance to reach the CL and that reason is Erling Haaland. 

Unrelated: I'm almost certain that he will stay at least another season and that that will be absolutely beneficial to all parties concerned.",gwwbqgc,n3n16r,borussiadortmund,2021-05-04 20:12:43,Pusmos,1

"Haaland has to be player of the season because no one has made as much a contribution to our wins as he has. In all honesty, none of our players have been exactly ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù over the course of the season, and the 3 players that I‚Äôd pick to be the most consistent are Haaland Hummels and Emre Can. But Haaland has stepped up when it counts the most. People might say his body language isn‚Äôt good and that he‚Äôs showing little passion for the team, but I call BS on that. No one celebrates other goals from his teammates like him, and he always has his teammates backs.

"My favorite story this season has to be Felix Passlack. I was convinced when he was in our youth he would be a big deal. Unfortunately, it never worked out quite like that. After a couple of disappointing and one alright loan spell, he is back. Everyone, including me, expected him to be sold immediately, but through hard work and persistence he manages to surprise everyone and actually gets a decent amount of minutes and some good performances.

I think he earned his new contract, and his willingness to extend despite limited minutes shows his commitment to the club. He may not be the most technically gifted player, but you can always see his readiness to give it his all. Recently, he also helped out our U23 in their promotion bid without complaint, and maybe he will continue to help them to stay up in the third division next year. He just seems like a great guy to have in the squad, and I'm glad he finally arrived for good.",gwrkw08,n3n16r,borussiadortmund,2021-05-03 18:18:48,Sarrazin,1

But for me, it's Hummels, one of our old guard, who deserved to be Player of The Season. His composure and commanding ability in defence deserve to be appreciated and also he proves it once again he doesn't treat us as ""just another Bundesliga's club"" since his return from Bayern.

I strongly believe he has been very underrated this season because he has been surrounded by some of the hottest prospects in European football, and the media has taken the spotlight away from him because a loyal player that doesn't wish to transfer to a different club doesn't help get clicks on articles or views on news videos.

There's no other player that radiates ""Nur der BVB"" like Marco Reus himself.",gxdkj1n,n3n16r,borussiadortmund,2021-05-08 19:14:27,thehostilepenguin25,1

"Thanks for doing this giveaway!

I'd say my POTS would have to be Haaland due to his contributions to the team. Aside from his 5-game drought, his consistency has been crucial to our season and I really think he kept us in the race for a UCL spot earlier in the season when we were going through our rough patch.

Aside from Haaland, it's been wonderful to see the growth of Bellingham, Dahoud, and Morey into players we could count on in big games. There has been a lot of negativity throughout the season (granted, we were in a tough spot in December), but if we can reach UCL and win the Pokal, then I think this season has been a success. It's been up and down, but hopefully we can end the season on a high note!

"I know it's the generic answer, but it has to be Erling Braut Haaland. Having this guy on our team is like having Auba back, except completely fucking jacked and a few inches taller. Its ridiculous just how much space he opens up because defenders have to be in constant fear of him. And if they're not in that fear and try to push forward or give him space, he WILL punish them.

"Would you take cash + timo Werner for haaland? Say you could get 140-160 mill in total value for him?

I would in a heartbeat. I kinda hope they sell haaland this summer and get a big sum for him. I just feel like he‚Äôs going to play it safe this year if he has any injuries etc and would take time off prior to his big move next summer.

Not sure why you wouldn‚Äôt cash in now vs only getting 70-80 mill next year when the release clause goes into effect. I feel they could replace him and have a solid core of players anyways now. I hate to say this but Dortmund isn‚Äôt going to beat Bayern for league. A 2nd or 3rd place finish to me is a win for bvb.

"BILD reports that BVB is close to signing Marcel Halstenberg from RaBa Leipzig. He is in his last contract year and had rejected Leipzig‚Äòs offers to extend.

Dortmund wants to pay 8m‚Ç¨, Leipzig wants 12m‚Ç¨. He is valued at 14m‚Ç¨ on Transfermarkt.

Halstenberg played for BVBII for two seasons (11/12-12/13), left for St. Pauli in 13/14 and joined Leipzig in 15/16 for 3,5m‚Ç¨.

Edit: Ruhrnachrichten responds to the rumors and say that ‚Äûaccording to [their] information, BVB does not want to sign Halstenberg‚Äú.

Edit: WAZ report that BVB are discussing signing Halstenberg on a free next year.

"[Kicker saying we are going to be bringing on Mario Baric from Werder Bremen.](https://www.kicker.de/werder-chefanalyst-baric-verstaerkt-bvb-807825/artikel) He will leave his chief video analyst role at Bremen and join BVB in the scouting department. 

DeepL translation:

‚ÄúWerder chief analyst Baric joins BVB

Borussia Dortmund has strengthened its scouting team. Mario Baric, previously Werder's chief video analyst, comes from Bremen. At BVB, however, he will take on a somewhat different role.

The end of Baric's tenure in Bremen was confirmed by Werder sporting director Frank Baumann on Saturday in the wake of the signing of co-trainer Tom Cichon: ""The trigger for the Cichon signing was Mario Baric's desire to leave the club because a new professional challenge awaits him. There were also family reasons for him to ask for a contract termination. Since we didn't want to block this chance for him and we also assessed the family situation, we complied with the request.""

According to information from kicker, the 36-year-old Baric is drawn to BVB and a contract is imminent. In Dortmund, however, he will not strengthen the analysis department, for which, in addition to Frank Rutem√∂ller and Serdar Ayar, Daniel Ackermann was also signed from RB Leipzig for the new season. Baric, who moved to the Weser from 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken in 2016 and was promoted to chief analyst under coach Florian Kohfeldt, will instead contribute his skills to the scouting department.‚Äù",h2f70am,nz7mn6,borussiadortmund,2021-06-20 20:25:13,Genetiker27,7

"[Kicker article regarding a Sancho bid from MUFC](https://www.kicker.de/bvb-lehnt-manuniteds-erstes-sancho-angebot-ab-807089/artikel), DeepL translation:

‚ÄúBVB rejects ManUnited's first Sancho offer

Borussia Dortmund is prepared to let Jadon Sancho leave. However, the first offer from Manchester United was apparently too low.

As reported by the BBC and Guardian, among others, on Friday, BVB rejected an offer from the English record champion for the equivalent of 78 million euros as too low. According to the BBC, ManUnited also wanted to pay the sum over five years, but Borussia is said to accept a maximum period of four years.

The Premier League runners-up have already reached an agreement with Sancho, who is to receive a five-year contract, as they did last summer. At that time, however, ManUnited failed to press BVB's transfer fee demand. And this year, too, the Red Devils know it: Dortmund won't let Sancho leave until he's worth 90 million euros.

The 21-year-old, who is in England's European Championship squad along with four ManUnited pros (Dean Henderson, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford), is still contractually bound to BVB until 2023.‚Äù",h1blxi6,ntwtlt,borussiadortmund,2021-06-11 04:14:54,Genetiker27,10

 Eindhoven. The 22-year-old has signed a contract that runs until 30 June 2026.

Bundesliga football club Borussia Dortmund has signed Dutch international Donyell Malen from PSV Eindhoven. The 22-year-old completed the obligatory medical check yesterday as part of BVB's training camp in Bad Ragaz (Switzerland) and then signed a contract with the German Cup winners that is dated until 30 June 2026.

""Borussia Dortmund is a top European club that always plays at the top of the Bundesliga and also has high expectations of itself in the Champions League. I can't wait to be on the pitch with my new teammates, to be able to compete with the best. And of course I'm excited about the fans and the stadium that the whole of Europe is raving about,"" says Donyell Malen.

Last season, the attacking player made 37 goal contributions (27 goals ten assists) in 45 competitive matches for his club, while the European Championship participant also scored two goals in 13 appearances for the Dutch national team in the 2020/21 season.

""Donyell is a player with great offensive potential, who radiates scoring power, brings in his creativity and has great pace, emphasised BVB sporting director Michael Zorc. Sebastian Kehl, head of the licensed player department, notes: ""Donyell convinced us with his performances at PSV. He can be used in different systems, be it up front, as a lone striker or as one of two attackers, but also in the outside positions. The BVB fans can look forward to Donyell.""

"1 more CB signing/loan like on a good CB that is starter quality, like Demiral for example, and it unlocks our tactical depth a lot. 

MAkes it so we can play 3 atb, such as 3-4-3, 3-5-2 etc which works good for our fulbacks and other roles, and can also hide our winger-depth issue well. Main worry here would be if Rapha breaks. Toto LWB probably better than Schulz honestly in that scenario. On the right Meunier/Passlack sadly now when wolf broke. BUt it should suite Meunier better.

Lets say we'd have Hummels, Akanji, Demiral, Zagadou after he's healed, Coulibaly &amp; Can for emergency. Thats definitely enough CB depth for 3atb.",h6pmtjl,ortgog,borussiadortmund,2021-07-27 22:37:03,Qiluk,5

"I'm rather worried about our squad depth and quality of depth for full-backs (and wingers).

We currently only have Meunier &amp; Passlack on the right and Guerreiro &amp; Schulz on the left.

Morey: will probably be out for the first half of the season.  
Piszczek: no replacement signed yet, we lost another quality option there.  
Wolf: possible option as right-back, but now out injured (played as a winger when Rose switched to a 4-3-3 in the second half against Bilbao).  
Schmelzer: still recovering and I'm doubtful about his future impact on the pitch.

If Rose mainly wants to play a 4-4-2 with a diamond, this formation will put a lot of emphasis on the central positions (one DM, two CMs, one OM). This also plays well with our current squad, which is overloaded with central positions:

DM: Witsel, Can, Delaney, Dahoud, Bellingham (Kamara, Papadopoulos)  
2 CMs: Witsel, Can, Dahoud, Bellingham, Delaney, Brandt (Raschl)  
OM: Reus, Reyna, Reinier, Brandt (Hazard)

However, a danger of playing 4-4-2 with a diamond is the possibility of being extra vulnerable for counter-attacks on the wings. Because of the central positioning, this puts a significant amount of stress on our full-backs, who might often face 2-vs-1 situations. And I'm not too confident if we currently have full-backs that can easily deal with such defensive situations.

(In a 4-3-3, which Rose played in the second half against Bilbao, the fullbacks will not be as exposed, but then we lack depth in terms of real wingers. I don't see that situation as critical as with the fullbacks, as we had some successes by playing our OMs out of position, but after Sancho left we only have Hazard, Knauff and Wolf as real wingers. Malen will be another option, but it‚Äôs also not his main position.)

For these reasons, I'd advocate for selling central players.  
Delaney: although I like him, he would get little playing time.  
Brandt: in my opinion doesn't deserve another chance despite being liked by Rose and Mariƒá.

For that money, we would need to get a Piszczek replacement and should look into upgrading Schulz for another player. I believe that is also the reason why we are looking at Halstenberg as a left-back option, who is not my favorite, but a decent option. I haven't heard any rumors that would address our right-back situation, placing a lot of responsibility on Meunier's form.

Another thing that would do, is possibly allow us to afford a winger this window aswell.

My stance is the same as with the Lazio rumours: If a good offer comes, sell him. If its not good enough, keep. Brandt is still an assett and talented player even if he isnt hitting his stride lately but its also a position where we could survive with selling a player. And thus add to Winger/CB/RB funds.

Brandt looked great sometimes but then misplaced passes other times. Overall he looks a lot more involved and active than last season so I see it as an overall positive for him.

&amp;#x200B;

"we played like shit, players looked absolutely gassed after 30 minutes. This is really irritating because last season it also looked as if we got less stamina than other teams with our players being exhausted while opponents still had energy left. Too often, we really fell apart conditioning wise in the later stages of games. You'd expect them to at least be goddamn physically fit - but who knows, maybe they had really strenuous training sessions beforehand.

Dahoud was fine but also sloppy at times and had some unnecessary risks here and there. Papa looked promising for a young CB, Knauff disappointed with sloppy play and bad defensive positioning. reus looked like am amateur most of the time. Haaland was barely involved in anything, Brandt either played great or catastrophic balls, just no in between. Schulz the same shit as always, G√ºrp√ºz up front didn't do shit either, Passlack showed why he can't be seriously considered as a first team option on RB once again.

‚ÄúClear approach in Malen poker: BVB ahead of transfer of its desired player

BORUSSIA DORTMUND

The weeks-long poker over BVB's desired player Donyell Malen is close to an end. On Thursday, the negotiations between Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven made significant progress.

Dortmund / Bad Ragaz, 22.07.2021, 22:27 h / Reading time: 1 min

Borussia Dortmund had already selected Donyell Malen as Jadon Sancho's successor weeks ago. After a tough poker game with PSV Eindhoven and advisor Mino Raiola, an agreement is now imminent, according to information from the Ruhr Nachrichten.

Direct contact between BVB sports director Zorc and Mino Raiola

On Thursday, there was a clear dynamic in the negotiations - there was direct contact between BVB sport director Michael Zorc and the notorious player advisor from Italy, who will once again pocket a million-dollar commission.

However, there are still some final details to be clarified. Ideally, Malen, who still has to pass the medical check, could already join the team in the first days of the training camp in Bad Ragaz. The transfer fee will be around 30 million euros. The 22-year-old attacking all-rounder is still under contract in Eindhoven until 2024.‚Äù",h6672ss,on64ep,borussiadortmund,2021-07-23 04:55:04,Genetiker27,16

1. No sign of Malen, so I still have no idea.
2. Madueke seems to be all that, which makes me understand why they want to keep him.
3. Mario is looking great! Damn glad to see it.

Specifically on #2, Madueke looks like Sancho two years ago. He's about to break out a big season and has three years on his contract. PSV would be nuts to sell him.",h62a4v6,on64ep,borussiadortmund,2021-07-22 07:13:31,TeamKitsune,14

"So apparently Paderborn bought Chris F√ºhrich from us after their loan and thus triggered the included buy-option. Within that buy-option we apparently ALSO had a sell-on fee too. And Paderborn sold him to Stuttgart shortly after.

So we sold a loanee AND got cash for him being sold afterwards too. Not sure about amounts tho.

These are the sort of things that frustrate me in my opinion when you lose a player like sancho there has to be a clear replacement or multiple replacements in order to reinforce the squad wether that‚Äôs a winger or backup striker I hope Dortmund get a few signings in i would be worried if they didn‚Äôt.,h5rf59g,on64ep,borussiadortmund,2021-07-19 23:21:58,Marcoreusbvb12,3
"[Dutch source](https://www.voetbalprimeur.nl/nieuws/989336/dortmund-directeur-zorc-waarschuwt-psv-en-overweegt-malen-transfer-af-te-blazen.html) saying we are willing to give up on Malen if PSV don't lower their asking price from 30m.

I think it's understandable. I'm still not 100% sold on Malen being the perfect fit for our squad if after that we can't make any big signings of starting quality wingers. So I don't think he should be worth much more than 25m in a Corona market. Of course PSV is free to refuse that. But if it's true that Malen has his heart set on Dortmund, then I guess they can already start to bolt down the chairs in their offices.

Honestly, Raiola is one of the reasons I'm not 100% thrilled with Malen. If he performs he'll be looking to move soon anyway. Which would be fair enough, but with guys like Raiola, clubs tend to benefit less and less from selling on with ""profit"". Reportedly, [Raiola gets a **30%** (!!!) cut from PSV](https://twitter.com/bvbnewsblog/status/1417113889368649729), and I assume similar things will apply to us (and presumably also with Haaland). So we definitely should think very hard about how much we want to invest in such a player.

But I assume in the end the clubs will just compromise somewhere in the middle with bonuses. We are to deep into it by now, and with preseason time running out and no obvious alternatives on the radar (for us fans at least), I doubt we'll let this transfer fail.",h5rbm6v,on64ep,borussiadortmund,2021-07-19 22:56:01,Sarrazin,12

‚ÄúOn Thursday, Eindhoven's technical director John de Jong confirmed to ""Voetbal International"" that the 22-year-old striker had been released from training to hold talks with other clubs about a transfer. According to reports, Malen no longer has to negotiate with BVB, and the parameters for a move to Borussia have already been discussed.

The only agreement left to be reached is between the clubs, and according to Dutch media reports, there is a difference of five million euros between what his current club wants (a transfer fee of 30 million euros) and what BVB is prepared to pay for Malen.‚Äù

Along with words on Madueke:

‚ÄúWhile Malen and teammate Denzel Dumfries have been released by the club to look for a new club, a transfer of Noni Madueke (19) is probably off the table. The right-winger was also on Borussia Dortmund's books, but in the dress rehearsal before the important Champions League qualifier against Galatasaray Istanbul, Madueke played 45 minutes for PSV and scored the only goal of the game in the test against PAOK Saloniki.‚Äù",h59zv77,oik32j,borussiadortmund,2021-07-15 22:14:37,Genetiker27,13

"[Very interesting quote about Rose by Scaloni](https://twitter.com/LeftBackFtball/status/1413829339200868354) especially with regards to squad planning and thus transfers.

He said that for South American football the diamond could work, and that in Europe he used it in a team in Austria and it worked, but when he went to Germany he had to change.""

Maybe he changed his mind in the meantime, or thinks he could do with Dortmund what he couldn't with Gladbach.

"While I don't like the idea of Haaland leaving already, I'm just really curious on what Dortmund's tactics are on his inevitable sale.

Yes, he's our best attacker, maybe even the most promising player in the world at the moment. But if there are clubs willing to pay twice the price they would have to pay in 12 months, I really doubt it's worth it to hold on to him. I don't think he'll carry the team to a league or european title. Yet the club is crystal clear, we're not selling him this window.

Any chance the board thinks he'll start to love Dortmund enough to sign a new contract without the clause, and having a Sancho-like agreement that we'll sell him for the first fair offer? I think that's highly unlikely because his low buy-out clause will give him room to demand insane wages.

I'm just really puzzled on what the tactic is.

Given he's always wanted a move to the Prem and was even down to move to Brighton before coming to us, leave is gonna be the most likely outcome here. Times running out before that move becomes hard for him to get.

"I love the idea of signing Sabitzer as a player, but I wanna know what the team plans on doing. If we sign Malen and Sabitzer and sell Delaney, we'll definitely be playing a 4-1-3-2 formation to start. This means that the 4 midfield players will most likely be Reus, Sabitzer, Bellingham, and Witsel, leaving Brandt, Dahoud, and Can to be rotated in. On top of that, if we play Haaland and Malen up top, Hazard won't start so he'll be fighting for minutes as well with Reyna. 

I understand that the squad depth is great to have, but I feel like this much depth in the midfield won't allow for everyone to get minutes. And if the 4-1-3-2 fails us and we need more width, we've spent roughly 50 million of the Sancho money with those two signings, which leaves us thin on width if we need it.",h4egyws,odz17a,borussiadortmund,2021-07-08 05:32:11,Bosna1909,11

Watching him on the screen was still great but man was it a joy from the stands.

The additional year with him was still full of great memories. You could see how much the Derby win meant to him. After the injury his return in such a great form was absolutely crucial for reaching CL. And of course above all: The Cup win.

"ManU fans on social media literally make me lose my faith in humanity.

Also can't stand the fucking PL clubs anymore, terrible management year in year out at most clubs and they just keep spending spending spending because they sold their asses to foreign owners. Yes I know Glazers are not the best example, but even United wouldn't be as rich if it wasn't for clubs like City helping create a league that can buy all the most valuable players.

Edit: just for the record: I was ranting, no I did not mean to say ManU are only a big club because City is owned by a sheikh, it's just frustrating to see the PL having such an oustanding advantage financially while some of it is simply due to clubs selling themselves to shady owners, benefetting them (and basically in the end the whole league) financially, while fucking up the competitiveness and integrity of football internationally (Super Leaguet etc. etc.).",h3o42py,obiadr,borussiadortmund,2021-07-01 19:02:46,edworm,109
"I know 85+ 10 in bonus payments doesn't sound great but let's be real here:

we got the kid for 7 million. We developed him for one year where he was an okay replacement player and a bit of an afterthought who got more playing time after Dembele and Pulisic left (whose transfer sum was inflated due to him being American and the potential earnings coming with that). He then gave us 3 strong years. We knew from the very beginning that he'd go to the PL if he develops properly. But what's more important is that we basically have a +88 million transfer surplus here with 4 years of service and every time one of those guys that was 'irreplaceable' left the team, someone else stepped up. The last to do so was Sancho btw after Dembele left. Dembele was virtually our entire offense after Mkhitaryan was our entire offense after Lewandowski was out entire offense (hyperbole in every case).

Adding to that, the team got better overall. We always reinvested the money and while not every transfer worked out (or even made sense, looking at you Schulz), overall we improved. I think it's really weird how there seems to be zero faith in the likes of Reyna (still 18) and Knauff (19) to potentially develop into just these replacements.",h3o5191,obiadr,borussiadortmund,2021-07-01 19:14:57,[deleted],55
"The best footballer alongside Rosicky who I saw in a BVB shirt. 

I wish him all the best. The fact that he extended his contract until 2023 when he didn't need to (like Lewandowski did) and helped us financially through his transfer, played a huge role in securing the CL and in winning the DFB Pokal during the pandemic makes him an absolute legend.

Tear it up in the PL and prove everyone of these ''he only did it in the bundesliga'' critics wrong. Show them what we knew and saw since day 1 that you will become one of the very best in the game, which you already are in my book after this season and the mature development you took. 

It was incredbile to witness: From being a wonder boy who was late to team meetings to someone who came back in the second half of this season after a difficult spell as a man who took responsibility.

"Alongside Messi, easily my favourite player in world football. Feel like he matured to an incredible degree here at Dortmund, never threw a fit and in the end carried us to our first trophy in 4 years. 
A wish him all the very best!
That being said, and I know it's irrelevant now, but I don't understand this move career wise for him. And I know he gets to go back to England, play with his homies and be paid a shit ton of money. He career wise in the long term, I don't understand the move for him.
For the last 3 years he was our best player, the best player of a Top 10-15 club in Europe. He is one of the best and most complete offensive players atm. If he intended on leaving Dortmund, it should have been to an absolutely elite club. Like I'm talking creme de la creme. A club that every year has legitimate chances and is among the favorites of winning the CL and the league title. You know the sort of clubs I'm talking about. However Utd isn't a part of that list. At least as of right now. And considering their ownership and the way other teams are improving, there isn't guarantee that that's going to change.
So why take the risk of going to Utd and be trapped in a situation that isn't of his liking, when he could've stayed in Dortmund until an elite club would be interested. That would've inevitably happened within the next 2 years.



 Anyways idk, that's just my take idk why I'm bothered by this. At the end of the day it's up to him. And I hope he will succeed üôè",h3lsa06,ob3klc,borussiadortmund,2021-07-01 04:50:57,alex_0611,9

"I have not hidden the fact I support another club as well that is rivals to theirs. So I am in a double whammy situation in comparsion to others here tonight. Shinji was a different situation all together, where despite my links with Liverpool, I did want him to do well (without that club doing well). Mhki I wasn't happy but I forgot about it after a few days in all honesty. I am a little down, but more so glad we can move on as a fanbase and club. The last year, whether it be here in this sub, r/soccer or Twitter  with their fanbase, or namely Romano and Fj√∏rtoft from the media pissing against the wind clout chasing desperately has been beyond tiresome. 

It would have been nice to get one more season out of Sancho in front of a full capacity stadium, to give him the send off he deserves for his efforts on the pitch over the last few years, but also for his professionalism during the last year. I was confident in Zorc and the tier 1 sources, but I was honestly worried he'd kick off in a push for a move last summer.

"Good to see the young guys in fine form scoring all three and especially cool to see Jude get his first home goal with fans present too!

Gio was lively and Jude is such a warrior. They definitely deserved to get one each and Haaland came to the rescue at the end!

Kobel also had to make some saves. Hoffenheim came to play and made us work for every bit of these three points today. We just about got it over the line in the end.

I'd love to see that Jude goal again though, that was so well handled and taken!

As for the MOTM, I'm inclined to say Reus on this one. He seemed to have his hands in a lot of the fine plays we had going for us, but perhaps there's another shout.

Tough game overall, but now we're going to have these awkward international breaks coming in for September. We'll be back to face Leverkusen in their ground in a couple weeks now.

Btw, any other Americans have trouble with ESPN+ today? I couldn't tell if it was my shoddy internet or the app itself. Seemed to happen a lot at the end of the first half and then again towards the final 20 minutes too gah.

We've conceded 9 goals in 4 matches yet I don't think you'd find too many people arguing that Koble hasn't been outstanding.

"I know we're all happy about the 3points but Im not happy about the game overall. So I do apologize for the negative tone in my comment since it'll be criticizing quite a bit.

- I said it in the match-thread but.. man I really feel for Rose. Our squad is so poorly balanced that he cant have any flexibility or consistency. I truly truly feel for him and hope people have overseight with that.

- Haaland wasnt very good this game. Had a few finishes but general play wasnt very good imo. Scored when it mattered tho which was a difficult angle. Important. It does bother me that people will talk as if he ""took care of it himself"" and similar stuff tbh. He shouldnt be immune to criticism.

- Corners. Absolutly embaressing. Atrocious.

- Kobel. That man deserves clean sheets but gets sold out by defensive errors every game. Absolute class from him so far. 15mill looks cheap rather than debatable at this moment.

- Reyna is still a bit too inconsistent for my taste. Inconsistency is fine at his age but he's too much of it imo. Great finish at the goal tho.

- Very solid appearance by Brandt. Hard to judge his overall form with appearance tho.

- What little I saw from Wolf, I actually think he looked aight. He isnt very technical but he does offer some width and workrate. He's the squadplayer we need imo.

- Bellingham started really meh, just like Malen. But both of them picked up and were really solid later on up until their subs.

- Hoffenheim were proper cunts in a lot of their challenges. A miracle we didnt pick up a big injury.

- Ref was atrocious. And why the fuck didnt we get that super obvious pen via VAR?

- I love the happyness of us celebrating after the whistle, but it also saddens me that we are when you think of the context. 3rd game of the season, home vs Hoffenheim and we barely fought us to 3points at the last minutes. Awesome in the moment, sad in the big picture, for BVB.

- Meunier completely under the ice but he isnt very trained and had corona so Imma give him a little more to get into the grove. Even if I dont have much faith, its only fair.

I REALLY REALLY hope we sign an RB and sneak in a winger at the very least this window. Or we're fucked.



EDIT: So many people responding and struggling to understand what Im saying with the 2nd to last point. Ive explained it over and over in responses.  I dont take issue with us celebrating, Im not calling Hoffenheim a free win, Im not saying we should always stomp everyone. Not once did I say any of those things or discredit Hoffenheim. Im saying that after that awesome initial moment, it reminds me of our consistent inconsistency vs smaller sides that is really sad and infuriating, and also very costly. Some really seem to struggle that you can be introspective without discrediting others and that moment reminded me of our issues once again. Even if that moment was amazing and I not once said we shouldnt celebrate and be happy about the moment and the points.

"Set pieces need work offensively and defensively. Reus killed the offside for the 2:2 otherwise we don't concede. Meunier took a few minutes, but then had a good game.

"Happy to see Jude get a nice clean goal after his work last week. Wolf was a nice surprise. Reyna is inconsistent, usually because he releases the ball a second late, but his highs are consistently some of our most dangerous attacking chances.

My worry remains getting Haaland more involved. At some point the tactics and formation are not getting your most dangerous player the ball in space often enough. I'm not sure it's time to give up on on the diamond yet, but it's almost time to worry.

Also, the defense is terrifying.",halp5qh,pcvfm6,borussiadortmund,2021-08-28 04:37:24,evoboltzmann,8

"The pressing was consistently poor. We put enough numbers into the press but without the necessary intensity which meant there was often a gap for a Hoffenheim player to play a ball out/through and thus cut out about 4/5 Dortmund players.

With the likes of Cavani and Ronaldo at striker, their wing positions can be filled by Rashford, Martial, Greenwood, Daniel James, Lingard, and Sancho.

"Here's my issues with the end of this window from us:

- We clearly had money we were willing to spend, even if we didnt sell any of the ""deadweight"". Yet we didnt have any backup targets in CRUCIAL(!!!) positions like RB or winger?

- We sat on our asses and waited for unlikely loan situations to pan out in the last days? Or what was going on? Makes us look clueless. 

- We GRAVELY overstimated the attraction our ""deadweight"" (burki, wolf, schulz) would have on the market and just sat and hoped theyd be offloaded so we could reinvest and it stalled our window to eventual death. Kinda screams ""out-of-touch"" with the market and the value of some of our own tbh.

- We're not giving Rose a great toolkit to work with and it makes me really sad for him. People are gonna turn on him the second shit goes wrong, and it will, and its gonna be beyond unfair due to his limited options. He was clear in interviews etc early in this window that he didnt want to rely on the diamond and wanted tactical flexibility. Gonna have to bandaid his way through match-days a bit more than he planned now. 

- Saw some news that we apparently extended Wolf when he went on loan, why? Why re-invest in an investment that hasnt shown to be worth the first investment yet? Supposedly also on a upper mid level wage too.

Idk... Im not even infuriated that we didnt sign 15135 players. We obviously arent in a position too. But the way things have been planned and the naivety of our actions are just inexcusable. Also.. why the fuck is Reinier still here? Absolutly 0 flame intended towards him, but he's literally just a waste of cash right now. He doesnt offer depth we need, quality we need or future-planning we need. 

Ofc theres a lot we dont know, looking in from the outside. But we can only judge from what we see and what theyve said in interviews etc. 

Idk.. at this point Id be ecstatic if we're top 4 and can spend some in January. I aint putting anymore expectations than that. The CL group is also gonna be harder than it needs to be, despite ""good draws"".

"Sorry, but this is bullshit.

It's one thing to be conservative with your finances in a difficult period, and it's another to look at Meunier and Passlack and spend the entire transfer period thinking ""yeah that's good enough depth for RB this season"" (with Morey out for who knows how long)

I'm looking at the outgoing transfers and, even you write off Sancho as Malen+Kobel and rest going towards covering COVID losses, you still have some money from Balerdi, Delaney, Toljan and Pisczu's salary taken off the books. Next year we'll get to plug whatever losses we incur this year with Haaland anyway. 

I refuse to believe that there isn't a 10-15 million RB somewhere in the top 10 leagues that couldn't come in and a do way more decent job than Meunier and Passlack. Atalanta took Zappacosta for around that price, who apparently played well on loan at Genoa last season. People around here scoffed at Dumfries, but if he's good enough for Inter to give him a try to replace Hakimi (in a way worse financial situation than we are) he's probably good enough for us to give him a try. Hell, maybe go for Emerson Royal when Barca was still trying to find a way to register Messi. Tomiyasu, Celik, Mazraoui as other names thrown around here - just get someone of that caliber, it's not impossible.

It's just stupid to know that you have a world-class player for just another season and, accepting the fact that you can't afford to build a title-winning squad around him, you don't even try to plug plug the most gaping hole in your entire squad and hope he carries you while Bayern are inconsistent with Naggelsman.",haxs9vl,p9ro2t,borussiadortmund,2021-08-30 23:21:08,Sertorius777,5

"A look at the stats really shows how little things have changed for us. 10 corners and not even one decent chance to show for it, wow that is poor. Unlike under Favre I don't think we're set up to have this much possession (though lots of games under him with similar numbers and similar outcome so what do I know). We do so much better when transitioning now, but we rarely had the chance to do that this game.

Haaland totally marked out of the game, completely ineffectual. Malen was poor in the first half, but he did get a little better; if we can get him turning on his defender like we saw a few times today that can be a great tool for breaking the opposition press. We pretty much just weren't good enough today, as sad as that is to say. We didn't have the right ideas or intensity for far too long into the match. Hopefully with most players coming back from injury we can improve in all areas moving forward. We're gonna need to if we want to seriously compete for anything this season.

"Shit game by the entire squad today. Was hoping Rose had answers for our kryptonite against low-blocking teams but that's gonna be WIP for the season. We need to find our rhythm attacking wide, Freiburg had zero problems compressing in the middle because of that

"Well, I was forced to miss most of the first half (due to technical problems), but it looked like Freiburg really earned their win today just as they did back in February this year with a sadly familiar score line to go with it.

Can't say much about the first half, but I would have liked to see some more solutions on the wing (since that's how our goal came) today. Freiburg was seemingly repeatedly plugging up the middle and then attacking afterwards with great success.

I've always had a great respect for Freiburg. They're tough to beat and always sniffing out some clutch goals. In the past we had great luck against them despite that, but that just isn't the case anymore.

Time to prepare for Hoppenheim's visit on Friday.

Edit: At least several players were able come back. It'll be good to have the likes of Rapha, Brandt, Emre, and Hummels back and I hope Schulz's injury won't be a nagging one.",h9sr060,p8tfg5,borussiadortmund,2021-08-21 23:29:50,Nextgen101,8

"You can excuse the first goal. Fine, that was a wonder-strike. Everything else, however wasn't working. The second goal was just from poor transition defense, and looked sloppy. What worried me is that the area where we are theoretically the strongest, the offense, looked disjointed and narrow. Malen wasted a golden chance, but so did haaland. Freiburg had a way too easy of a time keeping a team of this caliber penned in.

"Every game we have above 55% possession is always a shit one for us. It is better to try make something happen and give the ball away than to pass backwards for half the fucking game with no purpose or conviction. We play best when we are able to move fast and holding on to the ball for 76% of the match on the half way line is an utter disaster. Rose better give them a good talking to for playing with no direction or ambition. Have some guts and play aggressive, dominant football that forces the other team to chase, rather than allow them to sit back all game.

It is also amazing that we had 10 corners and none resulted in a goal, any other team would have made the opposition pay. 

Akanji was good but apart from that no one really did anything. Bellingham made some chances but needs to learn to finish and Passlack was shocking, no matter how much I like him as a person.

"Not a Rose issue. 

We have no Wingers or CBs (Zorc &amp; Kehl only recruiting CMs the last few years for some reason), and the fullbacks are too bad to play offensivt width, except for Rapha who had to forcibly come on after 35min to salvage. 


Freiburg could literally only defend centrally and sit tight on Dahoud and it was sorted, while countering on our injury ridden 1man defense. 

Fair win, beautiful FK goal but still incredibly frustrating.


Also some Haaland flaws very visible here. Still non-existant in the air despite his size and dont recognize when he needs to drop a little. 

Only 2 respectable BVB players on the pitch and it was Bellingham and Akanji. Kobel neutral. Did what he could.

\+ Hummels, Guerreiro and Brandt returning to the pitch

\- Not entirely unexpected due to how improvised our defense is at the moment, but still a bit worrying to see how much we struggle against a high pressing even against a side like Freiburg

\- Malen, Reyna, and ultimately even Haaland not with the best performances upfront

For this match only positive was akanji imo. Biggest negatives passlack, haaland and reus. Biggest problem imo is how we have no midfield, the ball gets stuck in defence, with all our attack in line with the opponents backs. So once the ball gets there, it is extremely tight.

"We never have any problems with teams that go ahead and attack us like Frankfurt, Gladbach or Leipzig.

We need long range shots, 1-2s into the box, someone to keep the ball in the area and look for a penalty or to earn freeckicks on the edge of the box.

With all the greatness of Haaland, he has two weaknesses that he need to work on if he wants to become a legend like Lewandowski:

1- He excels in wide space where he can run, but absolutely struggles in tight games and tight spaces.

"I don‚Äôt have any words for what happened in today‚Äôs game. In short, frustrating and dreadful. These tactics are definitely not working. No wingers and all attacks from the center obviously didn‚Äôt work. Having Passlack supplying haaland is a tragedy and not playing brandt when needed is also a very common issue. We got 85 million from Sancho transfer and we utilised none of it for fixing our defence. I understand that scouting talent is an important part of a clubs functionality, but we also need to find well established players who can bring their experience and already established talent. Kamara, Coulibaly are all bright players but they aren‚Äôt established‚Ä¶ we seriously need to fix the defence.

My solutions:
Ditch the 4-1-2-2 formation and play wide because with all the pace we have, not having wingers is atrocious.
Sign defensive backs. Not a talent or an upcoming youngster but someone who has established themselves. (Klosterman, Halstenberg)
Lastly, someone in the left or right midfield who had accurate crossing ability (Sosa from Stuttgart, Gosens)

We are the only top 10 club in the world that that has a net positive transfer budget, meaning our transfer budget is solely funded by our outgoing transfers. I hate the term of being called a farmer club or a selling club but the management does absolutely nothing to dispel these insults.

The only thing to take away from this match is that Passlack can't be expected to compete against the top end of the league. He is a liability as it is but it can be close to match breaking against the top end teams (Frankfurt won't be one of them).

"akanji was the best defender on the pitch up until the mistake. his diagonal set up the goal, his passing in general was constantly breaking lines and progressing the attack, and he was everywhere defensively. the quality difference was exactly where we knew it would be: the fullbacks and moukoko just weren't good enough. the rest of the side played right up to bayern's level, and that's really the main takeaway i have from a relatively meaningless game.

e: i see praise for moukoko and ‚Äî with the obvious addendum he's 16 and this criticism is only constructive ‚Äî i didn't see it. his runs were poorly timed or angled, and he doesn't have the raw athleticism to make up for the physical limitations of being 16 playing against grown-ups. he's a worthy first team player off the bench but facing a team like bayern is asking too much of him right now.",h9bykyh,p6buhg,borussiadortmund,2021-08-18 04:40:43,tim_cato,30

It's really disappointing to see. We have enough at the front, but the back looks so brittle right now. Freiburg may not be capable of the same clinical punishment this weekend, but with some of these giveaways, many players would savor their chances against us.

"* **the good**: Haaland, Reus and Moukoko triumvirate is an exciting prospect. Also Witsel as centerback, Kobel as sweeper and Dahoud/Bellingham is working. And the public my God. I don't know if the Corona times brutalized me, but it just sounded so strong.  
* **the bad**: Passlack, between him and Meunier we are just dead there. We just need to go to the market, and if it is somebody that can also play as central defender, even more. Also Reyna, kids have a right to be inconsistent, but he's invisible more times than the average, and it is hard to see how he will fit in the diamond when Reus is fit. And Stegemann can get fucked.   
* **the meh**: Schulz and Akanji (he was good beyond the brainfart). Also Malen, he seems to be playing in a different *time* to the rest, but well, he is just starting, lets hope he fits soon.  
  
overall, it wasn't the disaster I expected, but if Reus isn't hurt I can't truly care about a glorified friendly that we played with so many starters absent.",h9bxcdf,p6buhg,borussiadortmund,2021-08-18 04:32:13,LordVelaryon,38

But other than that I wouldn't be too surprised in a negative way. It's expected that someone like Passlack is struggling against such strong opposition and overall we had that many starters missing that you just have to count in defensive lapses.

What you have to consider is that Rose has to implement a completely new style of Football, while Bayern are more or less the same under Nagelsmann. People are being way too negative.

"Not to take away from your general point (we do need a RB), but we did not make 85m from selling Sancho. In total we will receive about ~55m, but not all of it this year - United was rumoured to pay this over five years. Plus, we already spend about 30m on Malen.

"&gt; I could not understand why we're not spending 85M from Sancho to a decent right back and center back.

/u/deniztheraven 

Because we spent 45mill on a VERY needed keeper and a forward that can play wide aswell to fill a creative offensive hole Sancho left after him. Then theres taxes, other fees around it all aswell as paying of some debts and financial leaks due to corona.


It doesnt work in a way where you sell player X for 85mill so you got 85mill in your pocket.

The issue isnt that we havent bought defensive quality and/or depth for Sancho money. The issue is that we've bought way too many midfielders in prior windows instead of recruiting for squadbalance.",h9cmbx1,p6bsi4,borussiadortmund,2021-08-18 07:41:57,Qiluk,17

"Unpopular opinion (?!): No, we don't need more right or center backs, when we don't sell RB or CB before.

We have already the biggest team in the league. It would be just a waste of money to buy another option for these positions.

Of course it's not ideal that we have so many injured players right now and that Can, Passlack, Wolf, Witsel has to play on a position other than their learned position but I wouldn't buy anyone when we don't sell \~10 players (or at least one of the CB and RBs) beforehand.",h9e0xml,p6ahyq,borussiadortmund,2021-08-18 16:49:05,MrChrisis,5

Positives
- Kobel despite letting in three goals is definitely looking like the goal keeper we've needed
- Schulz actually starting to gain some confidence, was arguably our best player today
- Once we have Guerreiro/Hummels/Brandt etc our depth will be rather tasty

Negatives
- Our backline really is missing having Hummels.
- Dahoud is should not be used as a defensive midfielder against more threatening teams. (Although we hardly have an alternative atm)

"New reports (from Bild tho) about the RB from Hamburg, Vagnoman. 

This time a cheaper price cited. ‚Ç¨4m instead of the previous ‚Ç¨7m.

Wouldnt be a bad move. Imagine we sell Delaney for, today reported 6m(offer)-7m(we ask), and then also Burki for a few mill. 

Since Vagnoman is cheap and would be on a lower wage, while we also offloaded Delaney and Burkis wages, we should be able to add a CB on top of Vagnoman. Unless we go uber safe.


Also reports of our continued interest on Halstenberg but its again only if Schulz gets sold. His stock definitely rised a bit after the 2 recent performances but I still suspect we ask for too much and there isnt much interest in him this window.",h9jo4n9,p58naz,borussiadortmund,2021-08-19 23:53:14,Qiluk,14

"Gonna copy and paste my bullet-point comment from the Social Sunday thread yesterday, about why the Delaney sale makes a lot of sense when you think about it:


Delaney moving even for ""just"" ‚Ç¨4m makes more sense the more you think about it. EDIT: 1min after posting this comment RN are reporting that the fee is still being negotiated with us. So 4mill might not be true and too low.

I'll bullet-point it:

- No other team have been reported to be interested, much less concrete interest. So not much leverage by having competition.

- 30 years old and 1 year left on contract. Not a ton of leverage with that in mind.

- Bloated position and most easily replaced with current players. 
- Good squad-pivot to sell a DM/CM to sign a defender.

- Only 2 weeks left in the window, if we wanna finalize the sale and negotiate and sign a new player, we dont have time to fuck around with negotiations for smaller sums.

- Watzke etc have already said we have funds to sign more players but we prefer to sell first.

- Its not all about fees. We want to remove a wage before adding another to not overextend ourselves. Especially since Burki hasnt been offloaded yet and might not even be sold this window at this pace. And being able to offload Schulz on his wages and price we likely are asking in relation to his level, doesnt seem likely atm.

- We want to be accommodating to Delaney whos been very professional and is very liked.

With all that in mind, even the 4mill makes sense. And it is the right move from a squad PoV. Even tho it sucks to see him leave since he is so lovable. Im very happy he gets a genuinely good move too and I hope he succeeds.",h95rp3k,p58naz,borussiadortmund,2021-08-16 22:22:49,Qiluk,23

"Everyone are gonna talk about Haaland so I'll comment on some observations I saw other than him.

- The whole ""mood is amazing right now"" genuinely seems true. From start to end the energy and mood looked incredible. Obviously fans being back and season starting again contributes a lot to that but it was still very very inspiring.

- Conceding from a corner sucks but it makes sense. Its our weakness and this time we even played without our best aerial CB and with tiny passlack. 

- Super sad Kobel didnt get to keep a clean sheet because he really deserved it. I hope the people who underrated him and questioning if he's an upgrade or not reconsider, even if its just 1 game. Incredibly confident, incredibly comfortable with the ball on his feet, VERY good distribution (watch the opposition-angle on that 3rd goal I think it was) and super strong mentally. 

- Schulz having a good game is very very good. I dont even mean in terms of him maybe having a resurgence but it also increases his stock a little and might attract buyers this window. 

- Reus havent missed a step since the end of last season it seems. Jesus he's looking fit and in-form. I'll tell you one thing, when Haaland leaves in the future, theres not gonna be many teams that can offer a partner like Reus for him. 

- Im SO excited to see what Rose and this team can do with a fit Rapha and hopefully a Meunier who proves us wrong and atleast stabilizes / plays in his NT form.

- Tiny appearance by Malen that didnt show much but he had some great ideas and runs. Think he'll fit superbly with Reus and Haaland.",h8xur3w,p4ddc2,borussiadortmund,2021-08-15 02:36:27,Qiluk,95

Makes for a great start to the league though, considering Bayern drew with Gladbach earlier. We have to go for a trip to Freiburg next weekend and that should be good fun.

Haaland is MOTM for me again, but Frankfurt really opened the door up for our attackers in general. It was exactly the kind of space we enjoy and the goals showed that. They fell prey to our effective press too.

But the Gio and Erling partnership is down to their chemistry and understanding of each other. Reyna‚Äôs best games we‚Äôre as a number 10 with Haaland ahead of him, they just know what to do together. I think if Gio plays the way he did last week in the pokal for the rest of the season, we won‚Äôt miss Sancho as much as once thought.

"Just want to clarify something. If Umtiti is willing to take a wage cut(like say 6 millions a year, nobody's gonna pay his barca wages), can we consider him as a cb option in a loan deal? My points supporting the argument-
1) yes, he has injury issues recently. But no one can deny his defensive positioning. The man won the world Cup, looked great the very few moments he played the last season and is looking great this pre season.
2) I really don't believe the ""washed up theory"". The same was said about Hummels when we bought him  and we can see how it turned out. People said the same thing about Thiago silva's move to Chelsea last year and that worked out well too.
3) Our cb position is interesting to say the least, on our good days, we probably have one of the best cb pairing in world football in akanji and hummels. But besides that we have a highly injury prone player in Zags, a versatile cdm in Can, 2 youngsters (coulibably and Collins), 2 untested players with 1 good preseason (Papadopoulos and Maloney). So I am basically saying our recruit doesn't need to be a world beater cb vying for the starting position, just someone who can step up when needed.
4) Buying an extra cb would also help the rb position (actually rwb). We could play a back 3 with Hazard as a starting rwb with passlack as a backup maybe the best option we would have right now. Also a lwb Guerreiro is much better than lb Guerreiro, so that would help too (This idea is actually taken from an article in Fearthewall, which is a great Dortmund fan page, so check it out)
5) Unlike many other clubs who would play hardball for their players in the covid market, barca would instead love it if we could help them reduce their wage bills. There's more chance of us getting a favourable deal dealing with barca than other clubs. Also recent info is that umtiti is open to taking a wage cut as long as the club is competitive in the major competitions. That sounds like us.
6) Finally this is a high risk, high reward situation. The guy is only 27, going to be 28. If this works out well, we would have a great defensive partner for akanji in the coming seasons. And as already pointed out, we have lots of young cbs with high potential, we don't need anymore 18, 19 Yr old cbs. If it's a loan, what's the risk anyway? If it doesn't work, we don't need to continue, it's as simple as that. If it works, he would have a one year contract left, which we would be pretty cheap for a world cup winning cb.",h7ig6s8,ow9d3k,borussiadortmund,2021-08-03 11:36:00,ComprehensiveEbb9431,5

"I'm really curious what out midfield will look like.

From the test against Bologna I'd actually be quite happy with Mo, Brandt and Jude.

Brandt showed so much more defensive workrate than I'm used to, so he might not be as much of a liability and he also did insanely well opening up space for Schulz on the left.

And well... Jude and Mo are Jude and Mo.",h7ew1pn,ow9d3k,borussiadortmund,2021-08-02 18:10:09,napoleonderdiecke,20

"Is it crazy to hope that if we do get at least 75M euros for Haaland next summer, we can spend 60-65 of that on Lautaro Martinez?

"A reliable Leipzig reporter says that the moment Schulz leaves Halstenberg comes. Have there been any links to Schulz lately? I havent heard anything. 

Also, I'm really not happy with how late our business is being done this summer. The EUROs did a number on us, a lot ot our starting players weren't even in Bad Ragaz. The days (more like day) of Brandt, Hazard and Schulz being announced before the beginning of the window seem so far away",h7tqlyg,ow6xg0,borussiadortmund,2021-08-06 00:36:22,RandomAssNword,15
"Over the weekend Sky said we were interested in Jobe Bellingham. 

Pretty low hanging and lazy link but I wouldn‚Äôt complain about getting him given he‚Äôs another seriously talented player. 15 and made a debut for the U23s and got a hat trick in the U18s in the same weekend.",h7nkisc,ow6xg0,borussiadortmund,2021-08-04 16:06:21,CubedMadness,29
"Supposedly Demirals move to Atalanta is a 3m loan fee with a 28m buy option.

Sounds like a perfect move for us but I suppose Demiral wanted to stay in Italy or we didnt committ enough. 

Atalanta do not give out big wages so definitely not that, that ended our interest.",h7mmitl,ow6xg0,borussiadortmund,2021-08-04 09:56:31,Qiluk,8

Doesn't seem super likely. Going from number 3 at Dortmund to number 2 at Atl√©tico is definitely an upgrade, but not sure that's what B√ºrki has in mind.",h7luhxz,ow6xg0,borussiadortmund,2021-08-04 06:11:36,Sarrazin,11

"Demiral to Atalanta, as expected. As I said in the previous transfer thread.. I didnt expect us to be as committing as they would be when it came to obligation/permanent transfer or fee. 

St:Juste chase back on you guys think, or new target? If we already are open to targets that would go for 15-20, I can see us having interesting targets if we sell Delaney &amp; Burki aswell. Should be another 12-15mill.",h7gk0rh,ow6xg0,borussiadortmund,2021-08-03 02:45:00,Qiluk,12
