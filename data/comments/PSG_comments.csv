This year we got 2 positive results against Real, won the Dortmund tie, fought back to win the Atalanta game, dismantled Leipzig, and held our own against Bayern.

He feels like an Ancelotti type manager. Ancelotti has had plenty of bad league games, but the man has coached some incredible big games and has 3 CL finals to his name. 

I'm throwing this back on Leonardo. I think Tuchel knows the types of players he needs. Hopefully we can Choupo back (laugh but he's helpful sub and good influence) and bring Icardi back to form. Letting go of T Silva was supremely stupid. I'm still mad about that.

"ok... one of the reasons I went away for a while was this sub being in love with Tuchel... I still hate those months he made us play 3 at the back...

Gueye and Paredes play the same style they're basically interchangable... subbing out Verratti to compose our midfield with Paredes - Gueye - Draxler is dumb.

Draxler has to go, he keeps getting played out of position and he's just not good enough. Tuchel's insistance on playing him right besides Gueye is dumb as fuck...

Tuchel's insistance on playing with no clear cut 9 made this game a pain to watch none of our attacking players Neymar included had anybody to pass or cross the ball to....

Florenzi was good. Kurzawa needs to go, this is not his first time against l'OM..

our CB pairing Kimpembe - Kehrer doesn't work, Kehrer is at best a rotational RB not starter CB material for PSG.

Tuchel has to know most teams are going to park the bus, he had no answer, specially when the only MF who can make a pass between lines is Verratti. it pisses me off when our coach has no initiative...

Zone defending set pieces, yeah this goal was on Tuchel.... fucking 2020 and this guy can't fucking work on tactics for l'OM....

I'll have to rewatch the match for this but I think Tuchel had the team playing contention instead of high pressure... like why are you playing defensive contention when it was obvious l'OM was parking the bus, fucking pressure to get the ball back quick.

I'm starting to resent Tuchel a lot, if you were going to give up 2 matches in a row at least play the academy kids to see if we have somebody up to the level we need.",g56uuhw,is6mjr,psg,2020-09-14 09:52:32,iHATESTUFF_,4

"I know people will accuse me of overreacting but I truly think Tuchel needs to be fired. And I've had this opinion for a while.

We have been very, very poor in Ligue 1 for over a year now (actually since the second leg against United). Yes we were winning most games last year but we rarely looked convincing. Usually it took a moment of genius from Neymar at the 89th minute.

Then some here will tell me about the CL run. Except that I don't think we were that good during that run. I think we (finally!) got lucky when it mattered. First leg versus Dortmund we were completely dominated and should have lost by more than 1. Second leg we won but it wasn't like full domination. Against Atalanta, we pretty much couldn't do anything for 75 minutes and we just got very fortunate at the end. The only good game was RB Leipzig. as for the final, while we got our chances, we were toothless in the second half. It's like we gave up at the 70th minute even though we just needed one goal.

It's not all Tuchel's fault, our line-up is clearly not that great and Neymar often has to do too much on his own. Neymar has also been complete shit with finishing for weeks now.

I'm just saying, PSG has played mediocre for over a year now, in all competitions. To me it's time to change the coach. Pochettino is available, Allegri too. Heck, Conte might as well. There are choices out there.",g55v1eo,is6mjr,psg,2020-09-14 05:05:45,[deleted],5

"I mean, what were people really expecting in this match ?  
Half of our team is missing, the other half is composed by young guns, some of whom have just come back from their NT duties.  
There's no chemistry, and to people saying Tuchel is shit and not making the proper subs : guys, look at the guys on the bench, only defenders were available, so he's not gonna put a freaking CB up front is he ?

On the positives, we got to see what our young players' level is like.  
Ruiz was pretty good, Bulka made the rookiest of mistakes and really doesn't look that great...  


I don't expect anything of the match against OM, you can't really judge a made up team like this, just hope our main players come back soon and that Leo will get us some good recruits.

"The problem isn't that we lost, it's how we lost.

The lack of energy is really bad. Our overreliance on Verratti really hurts. I'm not saying this to slight him, it's just that when Verratti is the only one who can successfully progress the ball and create danger for the opposing team, it's very easy to isolate him and thus neuter our midfield.


Bulka's mistake isn't that bad honestly. If you think about it, having the creative midfielder drop that deep to pick up the ball is always a gamble. You're giving the opposing team a dangerous situation for free.


We also lost a lot of duels. Way too much. Are we that frail physically? Do we lack that much stamina and grit? 


Ruiz was rather good. Very much hope to see more from him. 

Kalimuendo had some interesting moments, but fell short. Needs more lucidity in the box. Great at holding the ball though, he looked like the only player up front that is not letting himself get dominated physically. It's a shame that the wings did not capitalize on this, though I saw Ruiz try.

Sarabia.... Just why man.


As much as I don't want to criticize Tuchel, I do have to ask questions regarding Bakker up top or putting Kurzawa at RB. With that many defenders fit this should never happen. Not to say that Kurzawa did a bad job, but you can tell RB is not his position.

Putting Kehrer at CB is good. He was originally meant to play CB (though he did play DM in Germany before), but he was decent. If anything, we should have him be the backup CB rather than looking for a new one. We need to invest in other areas.

Our lack of offensive weight aside, what hurts is the lack of intensity. Players have let themselves be pushed around outsped, overtaken way too much. As much as we emphasize getting players that have a certain technical level, we should also ensure that our players can actually last long enough to have those technical abilities make the difference.",g4rfr5g,iqc31s,psg,2020-09-11 06:15:57,Belfura,7

Maybe we should just rip the band aid, fire him and bring Allegri. I’m not particularly fan of the guy but we need an united front in our leadership, We can’t have a trainer and sport director who don’t agree on anything.",g3toh4g,ilon0c,psg,2020-09-03 17:07:07,HugoChinaski,-2

Pereira is a CDM for Portugal and Porto yes but he plays 4-3-3 role of sentinel. Tuchel doesn’t want a Thiago Motta, Tuchel wants a Caseimiro. 

A Thiago Motta when you don’t have the possession reposition himself backward to help the defense and commits tactical fouls in last necessity. 

A Caseimiro straight up step forward and attack the guy with the ball using his speed and mobility to recover the ball quickly or stop the attack and force the opponent to pass back.

"Wtf are you waffling about? Why would a Motta replacement come on the last minute of a transfer window as a loan move from an inferior club that basically wants to dump the player.

Even if he is a Motta replacement he should do more than fine as a CB in a high pressing team. 

A CDM used as a CB is normal in teams that press very high as a defensive action. Look at this season Mourinho where Eric Dier is being used as a CB while their forwards and midfield press very aggressive and high.

Marquinhos has been used as a CDM (Since month 1 of Tuchels arrival) because he provides strong pressing action like Fernandinho and is highly physical and has decent release ball. You don't see his value when he bodied Pogba who is the best midfielder on the planet. During big games he can help in nullyfing any midfield.

"I have to laugh, as a Man United supporter, when so much of the footballing audience is having a go at Tuchel, who in my opinion, is a  fantastic coach. Off the top of my head, I could see the following  problems for which I am not sure Tuchel is entirely to blame:

1. **No creativity from midfield**:  Herrera and Gueye are mediocre players and offer zero creativity.  Danilo is very good as a defensive midfielder but even he doesn't offer  much going forward.
2. **No creativity from the full backs**:  PSG's fullbacks are truly dreadful, if I may be honest. Not very good  in either defence or attack. One only has to look at Robertson and Trent  for Liverpool, Davies and Pavard/Kimmich for Bayern, Alba and Alves for  Guardiola's Barca or Marcelo and Carvajal for Zidane's Madrid to find  attacking full backs who create (or used to create) loads of goal  scoring chances for their forwards. I am sure, for instance, without  Trent and Robertson, regardless of all the talent of Salah and Mane,   Liverpool would have found it much harder to score as many goals as they  did during the last couple of seasons. Moreover, its not just the  dangerous balls that these attacking fullbacks send into the box but  they also widen the opposition back line, leading to more space created  in the centre for the forwards to exploit.
3. **No creativity from the centre backs**:  Of course, this is rarer, but then you consider centre backs like Van  Dijk, Boateng, Hummels, Bonucci and Alaba who provide loads of key  passes throughout the season which often lead to several goal scoring  chances. In contrast, PSG did not have any such centre backs yesterday.
4. **Too reliant on front 3**  : So where did the creativity come from? PSG did have a total of 15  attempts of which 5 were on target. They were all down to the individual  brilliance of Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria without any support from the  other PSG players. Neymar and Mbappe both largely played on the left  interchanging positions between left wing and left centre forward. But  then were often crowded out by Man United players. Whenever, Neymar was  on the left wing, he had Mctominay, Fred and Wan Bissaka all over him  like a rash while in the centre forward position Mbappe had both  Tuanzebe and Lindelof around him. That's 5 Man United players closely  guarding 2 PSG players who were, thus, often severely outnumbered. Di  Maria, on the other hand, was always isolated on the right wing closely  marked by both Shaw and Telles.
5. **Lack of tracking back from the front 3:**  I do not know whether it was a tactical decision from Tuchel, so that  there could be quick counterattacks against Man United or simply the  primadonna behaviour of Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria but whenever Man  United attacked, PSG's front 3 usually refused to help out in defence.  It was such a stark contrast to watch Martial, Rashford and Bruno  pressing as well as tracking back far more intensively than their  counterparts in the PSG lineup.

I do remember the October, November, December and January months of  2019-20 season, when Man United were, simply, dire to watch. That was  the period when Pogba had been injured and Bruno was still playing for Sporting. Watching Lingard and Periera trying to create for Man United's  forwards was utterly excruciating to witness. It was only compounded by  the fact that neither Mctominay nor Fred were particularly good going  forward. Furthermore, our fullbacks Wan Bissaka and Shaw offered nothing  in attack.

But the fans used to have a go at Rashford, particularly, for being terrible and not good  enough for Man United even though the mancunian lad was trying his best  to both create his own chances as well as score goals out of nowhere  without any support, whatsoever, from his teammates. There were also calls for Mata to be sold, primarily because there was nobody in the  starting 11 who could play on the same wavelength as the Spaniard. Our forwards were often isolated and crowded out in the attack.

I see similar issues ailing the Paris St Germain team. As far as Tuchel  is concerned, as an avid watcher of the Bundesliga, I still remember how  utterly exciting it was to watch both his Mainz and Dortmund teams.  Both of them at the time, were two of the finest pressing and  counter-pressing sides in Europe. To see the PSG's players not press  with the same intensity, leads me to believe that it is impossible to  make certain high profile players  play with the same intensity as you  would a bunch of mid table or lower table quality players. For instance,  I do not think Klopp, Bielsa or Rangnick will be a success with PSG,  Barcelona or Real Madrid. Their highly paid primadonnas will simply  refuse the gruelling pressing demands placed on them by those gaffers.

Anyway, to summarise, I don't believe Tuchel is exactly to blame for  yesterday's debacle. I always had a soft spot for the German and would  like to wish him the best of luck for the future.",g9ixb1w,jf8zr6,psg,2020-10-21 17:29:30,[deleted],6
"We've talked a lot about the midfield and attack but the defense should be mentionned too. At some points, we were left too exposed at the back. Kimpembe and Diallo made some miraculous saves but it shouldn't have gotten to this point. And when that didn't happen and we tried a low block, it also didn't work because our midfield systematically dropped back way too low as soon as ManU got the ball and tried to get the ball back at the edge of our box.


And that's another problem. I've seen lots of complaints about the front three not tracking back. But the problem with the midfield dropping as low as described above is that the forwards will also have to drop much much lower to keep the team cohesive. And then run too much back to get scoring opportunities. And another problem right here: as soon as the forwards got the ball, the midfield also stopped and stayed too low. Which means that in both offensive and defensive phases, the trio was too isolated. It's not only that the forwards didn't help defend. It's the midfield that didn't help attack. Even Kimpembe and Diallo had to take the ball up to the front three several times.




Back to the defensive phase, the forwards did try to defend. As soon as they lost the ball, they repositioned themselves or tried to win the ball back on the spot (Neymar and Di Maria mostly). But because our midfield was too low, and ManU's was too, our forwards were in inferiority and easily bypassed. And when the defensive line is already so far from you and nobody pressed forward to help you defend, at some point you just stop and don't care about tracking back and I think that's some of what happened.



In 2018-2019, we would have pressed all over the field. Yesterday, we looked like we couldn't be bothered and that's on the midfield as much as the attack.",g9ivigx,jf8zr6,psg,2020-10-21 16:55:07,no_known_name,6
"You could criticize Tuchel for setting up our team poorly, but in his defence, we didn't have many options. 

We don't know anything behind the scenes. Everyone wants Rafinha to start. I do too, but he was taken off before 60 minutes last game and hasn't played in the international break. Would he have been able to play for at least 60 minutes? Tuchel would know more than us. If Rafinha lacked match fitness, we are literally left with 3 destroyers in midfield and no creativity. But if this is the case, I think Tuchel should have considered starting Florenzi in central midfield and playing Dagba at right back. There can also be the possibility of starting one of our titis (i.e. Fadiga), although that would've been a bit risky.

We were poor, but things will get better soon when we have our pure 9 back, our creative midfielders fit, and Marquinhos back fit again (so we don't have to fucking play 2 left-footed CBs). Still, I hope this will be kind of a wake up call for everyone - our team isn't as good as we think it is. We'll need to win our next few group games or we will be in serious trouble.",g9iumb1,jf8zr6,psg,2020-10-21 16:37:57,DKofFical,10

Does someone want to go pick up Mbappe? He’s still stuck in Wan-Bissaka’s pocket.,g9huhfp,jeyflb,psg,2020-10-21 08:56:08,StripedBandit,5
"Starting from the referee. What was wrong with him? Neymar getting a card because he said Mbappe was fouled in the penalty area? How McTominay kicking Herrera in the back is not a second yellow? They should've been playing with ten since then. Neymar was fouled two times in the beginning by two players at once and the ref did nothing but when he got away from McTominay who was trying to take him down to the ground and passed the ball to Di Maria who could create a scoring chance, he whistles. I felt like I'm watching Ligue 1 match. And how did I know they will get a penalty, lmao. Get ready for at least two more at Old Trafford. Just can't wait!

Whole defensive midfield was bad idea all along but I didn't expect it to be that bad. I shouldn't be surprised tho, knowing that we can't play under pressure. Danilo was the only one who could do anything and cover anyone, he was everywhere. Rafinha looked quite good when he came on but that happened way too late. Why is Tuchel always making those late changes, I will never understand. Neymar had to play with three players at his back all the time and had to be everywhere (and Di Maria), as expected when there is no connection with midfield. Sorry but seeing them pass to Neymar when he is surrounded by four players and expecting him to go past half of the opposing team and make magic happen is laughable sometimes. He was far from being great anyway, but at the same time I can understand why he was done by the end of the match. What Tuchel expects him to do, where to pass, when he has two people just in front of him and who don't let him move. 

Here we are, losing group match at Parc des Princes for the first time since 2004 (is that info correct?). It's not the end of the world but it hurts anyway. It'll be hard one to forget, hopefully the second meeting with them will look different. 

Thank God for Navas.",g9hmp0d,jeyflb,psg,2020-10-21 07:42:49,Desire_Is_Power,13

"For some reason I don't feel anger or frustration like many losses before. I just feel contempt toward Tuchel as a coach. It's not the first time his tactical mediocrity during important games shows so glaringly.

It was such a shameful display, a failure on entire squad level, I can't even pick a player out of this game and say he played at the expected level. Even Kimpembe was disappointing. Maybe Navas was fine?

We got some top tier players (and average ones), but everyone played poorly. They seemed lost on the pitch. The tactic was OBVIOUSLY the wrong one against an opponent like that. Tuchel approached the game as if PSG was in hat 4 and ManUtd in hat 1, at home... damn this guy is becoming unbearable. 

Not even mentioning his constant whining in front of the medias. He forced the club to sign a few mediocre players we can't sell now.

I don't think Tuchel should be sacked yet, but if the PSG doesn't get out of the group phases in first position, that guy can fuck off.",g9h6ye5,jeyflb,psg,2020-10-21 05:29:17,ImNotARobotFOSHO,10

"It's sad that Kurzawa has to be the person driving the ball forward because there's no midfield or tactics, literally dead at the end because of that and gets replaced by a teenager who let's his direct opponent score.


Tuchel is honestly decreasing player value at this point and it's insane Fadiga / Simons doesn't get to play instead of Herrera when Herrera is literally just a slow pawn floating around the pitch losing the ball occasionally and being pushed to the floor by United players that replaced him 2 yrs ago. Sad.


Edit:

It's also very sad that high quality / creative players at PSG are FORCED to make magic happen, they literally have no other option. Neymar and Mbappé have gone from team players to players who receive the ball and have to run past 4 players and score or give an assist because that's what your team expects from you and there's no other way to score a goal.",g9h4esq,jeyflb,psg,2020-10-21 05:11:21,TyquanWorldMessi,17

"All those that are Tuchel fans can you please explain to me what his game plan is?

I am not a random football fan I have been in love with this game for over 40 years and have seen him at Dortmund where I watched his team for the whole period he was there and now at PSG.

I struggle to understand anyone that calls him a tactical master as it seems to me when people talk about tactical genius or whatever it is always when a manager neutralises the threat of his opponent.

It is rarely when they produce great football, to me it seems like a negative football connotation.

I was perturbed when I saw his interview before the game talking about how dangerous United are on the counter and how he aims to counter that.

This is the problem in a nutshell when a manager picks his team solely based on how to neutralise the opposition instead of how to hurt the opponent.

People need to get over last season and see it for what it really was, the opportunity arose as it does for a lot of teams that then do nothing afterwards.

The likes of Blanc, Ancelotti and even Emery would not have minded meeting Dortmund in the second round missing Reus for both legs, having Can sent off and Witsel go off injured; meet Atalanta (playing in their 1st ever cl campaign) in the quarters and RB Leipzig in the semis.

Not a strong Chelsea side or Barcelona and Real Madrid in packed stadia over 2 legs.

I saw the lineup and I was gobsmacked but then I saw United's and had some hope. Even my younger bro who is a United fan was pretty angry with Solskjaer with his choice.

Then the game unfolded and PSG were hopeless for almost the entire game. I would not have been annoyed if his tactics which was to nullify United counters actually bore fruit but United countered at will with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings.

&amp;#x200B;

Any decent manager would have looked at the 1st half and changed it immediately as nothing was really working.

The usual Neymar beating and nutmegging players looking for inspiration, Mbappe trying to find space, they both ended coming so deep as there was absolutely nothing coming their way.

Yes he did something right by bringing on Kean but how many times is he going to try playing Mbappe through the middle when my dead granny knows that never ends well.

Midfield should have been changed asap but this is what Tuchel is comfortable with. Being solid and hoping Neymar, Mbappe or Di maria would do something.

Sometimes I think he makes substitutions for the heck of it as I honestly did not see the point of bring on Dagba, Sarabia and Bakker for like for like subs.

United actually outplayed PsG. That was the most painful part as they thoroughly deserved to win and Keylor Navas would be mightily disappointed that his heroic display came to nought.

The last these 2 teams met PSg played by far the better football and did not deserve to go out but the football has just regressed and what works against the Nimes of this world would not work against teams with pace and quality midfielders.",g9h6xpq,jew0a9,psg,2020-10-21 05:29:09,ukuser1968,3

There is no creativity at all in the midfield. It’s obvious. Verratti needs to sort out his health because he’s always out in the big games with injury recently, and he’s exactly who we need in the midfield right now. Paredes, or even perhaps Rafinha, could be really beneficial right now too.

Rafinha also looks promising, good technique and passes. His assist to Mbappe was great. Wish we could find a space for him in the starting eleven, him together with Neymar would be amazing and would take the burden from Neymar a little bit.  

Herrera also was good imo. Gana too, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention but looks like he starts to play more forward, not only passing backwards all the time. He set the whole action for Sarabia goal.

Mbappe one of the best today, if not the best, and also beautiful gesture with the shirt for Lucas (his little fan).

"I would have preferred for the lineup to be made up of players that hardly play especially kids with potential to show what they are capable of.

Pointless having Mbappe and Kimpembe starting after their exertions for France.

Likewise Paredes and I am not sure if Gueye played for Senegal and if he did then he should not have started.

Bitch move not to start Dagba and frankly what would be negative impact on starting fringe players and kids all over the park in this game?

So what if they lost there is no chance of any team apart from PSG winning the league this season.

There is nothing remotely resembling Jardim's Monaco that won the league with all those awesome players.

All the loan deals indicate that PSG has not the money they used to have in buying players so why not play the kids in games like this?

What message are you sending to them that in a week where there has been 3 internationals per country and with a champions league game away on Tuesday they are not even given a chance against a team like Nimes?

Then when they do a Kouassi and leave and the PR guys brainwash you guys into thinking they were offered something substantial but they left for pasture anew some clown would create a thread about how a 17 year old boy was left out of Bayern's cl team.

As for the game what conclusions can you actually draw from playing a very poor side that were playing with 1 man down for most of the game?

Very little as this was no test at all. Kean did not have a good game and though people say he is a number 9 the best thing he did all game was late on where he beat about 3 players in his own half as he was moved wide to accommodate Jese.

The rest of them performed as you would expect them to against very modest opposition.

-As for Florenzi I feel like he's been with us for months now, seems like a great crosser.

"Is it weird that I'm rooting for Choupo-Moting's success at his new club more than Cavani? 

Cavani is the club's all time top scorer and undoubtedly one of the biggest legends of the club, for many years here he was an absolute professional and did his job despite being misused by Laurent Blanc. He was the only shining light of that awful 2016/17 season when he took up the mantle of the team's talisman and made everyone wonder ""who needs Zlatan?"".

 He broke many records here and made so many fond memories but the way he left leaves an awful taste in my mouth and I'm actually conflicted as to how much I'll support him at his future club, which is weird because I support nearly all PSG players who join other leagues unless they never really broke into the first team or they conducted themselves horribly (like Aurier or Rabiot). But for some reason I'm not feeling particularly strongly about supporting Cavani at his new club. Is it weird to feel cold towards a man I had such immense admiration for only a short while ago?

"Oh my... what a week-end.    

Starts friday evening in a context of a very dire mercato with a unconvincing (lol) 6-1 win, quickly followed by internal strife between Leonardo and Tuchel turning into civil war between PSG supporters.      

Saturday, I watch Chelsea getting its footing back with an imperial Thiago Silva...sigh...   then an amazing Leeds forcing City to play defense and protect the draw     

Woke up late on sunday to a big sigh of relief with Danilo and Kean, watched Leicester crumble, Inter shockingly waste a victory within its grasp, enter the bizarro world with the historic humiliations of Man United and Liverpool while Lyon and Marseille cancelled each (epitome of Ligue1 shocking lack of finishing and quality), intriguing signing of Choupo and Bouna Sarr by Bayern. Cherry on this cake of intense drama on the pitch and outside of it is the opening of the promising subplot of Edinson Cavani to ManU.

Marco Verratti reminded people why he’s one of the best midfielders in the world by his performance. I thought he played really well today. Now, we’ll need him to stay healthy if we hope to win all 3 trophies. 

We desperately need to be more clinical in front of the net. With the Fantastic 4, there’s no reason why we should be struggling to score as much as we do. And I’m glad to see Mauro Icardi return from injury.

"I am really happy with our game.   
They showed heart. No matter how much $$$ you have on the pitch these are human beings, not Ferraris if they are not fit they won't be able to perform, Leipzig players should really be ashamed of being unable to beat a team full of injured and unfit players who did not have rest or preparation between the season and the final 8.  


We just need to survive until the winter break.   
If the club is smart (let's hope), they will sacrifice some ligue 1 games so the team can have a real preparation. And be at 200% for UCL.   


If we do that, this could be our year. Most of the teams from the final 8 are struggling in their league or in CL, they won't be able to focus on UCL. Also, I expect the teams from the top 4, who played through coronavirus last season to collapse in the second part of this season.

"* With Verratti. we become much more press resistant and can move the ball forward. Rafinha also offers better mobility and movement, but that's not really saying much. However, both make a lot of heads-down challenges for 50-50 and interceptions. Great when it works but also results in a lot of reckless fouls and yellows.
* Ander Herrerra. Paredes, and Danilo are horrible in attack or build up (though I think it's ok if Danilo can provide cover for other midfielders). With this type of midfield, our attack will overly rely on Neymar or Mbappe to drop back as a part of the build up and we will struggle. The alternative will be long balls to Mbappe which won't work against teams who are prepared for this type of tactic.

Tuchel switched to 5-3-2 to let the ball to Leipzig who didn’t do much with it (apart from Konaté and Upamecano). Our defense kept pushing them back for 90 minutes.

"Shit match and shit performance, but the team held on, even against that hellish press.

Verratti in 10 minutes completely changed our game which just highlight why our team is so shit right now : we have no midfielders who know how to move forward with the ball, who know how to dribble and create space. Raphinha  is really not that great still. 

It’s a painful performance so I’m not defending Tuchel or anything, but with Herrera, Danilo at the mid and the unreliable Paredes, you can tell why any manager would shit the bed and be unable to make the team play well. 

Our forward were disappointing mainly because none of our mids can create space and launch them in a proper way. Neymar really seems out of form. And I’m infuriated every time i see the front 3 jogging or walking when the ball is like 2 metres away. But then again, they were gassed out so...
Di Maria has another ghost performance, so we really need to think about who can replace him in the long run. 

3 points and the difference ranks us 2nd.
We can still make it and hopefully by next match, we will get back Verratti, Icardi and have a much more decent team.",gdhnipx,k0epio,psg,2020-11-25 06:06:52,HaaamGirl,7
"Damn what a tense last couple of minutes man, the whole game really but wow.

Overall disappointed in the offense but at least you can’t say our defense was bad. Here’s what I think of the players 

Mbappe - dude was just camping waiting for long balls, but maybe that’s what TT told him to do

Neymar - he tried but he’s not 100%, not even close. It was a bit sad really but at least there was effort

DiMaria - ghost

Paredes - risky but not so bad. Was trying to set up the long balls but nothing ever really came up effective. 

Herrera - at least he was free 

Danilo - again not bad pretty solid, not gonna lie didn’t really pay much attention to him but nothing bad stood out this time. 

Bakker - what a guy, do you guys remember when he was ass? Dude’s been making progress.

Florenzi - I will always be thankful for a proper right back

Marquinhos - I love you bby 

Diallo - he had a good game and by that I mean he didn’t concede a penalty.... that’s it... that’s the bar he’s set

Navas - I love you bby 2.0 you can do no wrong in my eyes 

Raphinha - I’ll take three of him 

Verratti - I love you bby 3.0 please have my babies, or I’ll have yours whatever is best for you just let me know 

Kean - dude came on with the triple pump, 4x4, all terrain, hydraulic press 3000

Stressful game but happy for the dub. Let’s work on getting our guys back in form and building that chemistry back.",gdhnglj,k0epio,psg,2020-11-25 06:06:23,96lowky,21

The only good thing about this game is the last 5 minutes where there was some chemistry. Interestingly enough thats when our superstars are off the pitch.

Some players stand in place, don't develop at all. Is that they are really that bad or it's trainings' fault?

Another match, same shit. Hard to believe the players have any confidence and also faith in Tuchel left.

I hope that after the international break is done everyone comes back healthy with new strength and we will win the three matches that are yet to play with high scoring resultats.

"Not grieving at all on my behalf. This was to be expected, a draw would have been a great result. I'm genuinely curious what the TuChEl OuT's arguments are. Let's recap the situation : Neymar, Mbappé, Draxler, Verratti, Paredes, Icardi are out. Di Maria and Rafinha are completely out of form. So basically no creators in the team. The physical condition of the team is a disaster because no pre-season preparation. The mental condition as well because lack of proper summer break to recharge the batteries. The bench ? No forwards, no midfielders, only non experienced youth. For this match, you basically have a made up team with the players available, no guarantees at all.   
So explain to me : what should Tuchel do ? Aside from the Marquinhos/Danilo thing.  
What are his options ? I'm willing to bet that any coach in his situation would have the same problems. None of Guardiola, Zidane, Poch, Allegri. Nobody could do any better in this mess.  


This match is tough to take in since, if Di Maria had scored his penalty, it would have been a completely different match. Unfortunately, that's football. There's still hope to win it, if we win all our future matches. It's not over.

"I am no fan of Tuchel but I can understand both sides of the Tuchel arguments.

For the pro Tuchel guys I too feel that its unfair to not be more understanding of what Tuchel had to deal with regarding yesterday's game.

First he loses Neymar then 3 days to this match he loses Mbappe. 

On paper this was going to be the most difficult fixture and to go into it without your 3 most creative players is really asking a lot.

For this I had sympathy for him and whatever happens in the game anything other than a defeat would be a minor miracle. 

For the anti Tuchel I get them too. My understanding of their anger stems from watching the game and knowing that Leipzig lost 5-0 to Manchester United and 1-0 to monchengladbach recently indicating they are not on good form.

I've seen people on here bemoan lack of quality in PSG squad but from what I saw of Leipzig, man for man PSG has more quality. 

The stupid chances they kept taking at the back when they are not very good players was lunacy. 

Nobody in their midfield was of real high quality as Heidara and Sabitzer are very good players but not top top players. 

I do like Fosberg and olmo but they too are hardly world class while Nkunku is decent at best.

I never understand how you could be losing a game but your opponent makes a change before you do.

I have read people moaning about Paredes not coming on at all and Rafinha coming on way too late.

Personally I'd have preferred Ruiz coming on to those 2 as Rafinha has shown me nothing so far.

Injuries or not that midfield is unacceptable and way too cautious. 

Then again with the nonsensical subs. What in the world was Kehrer coming on to add to the game?

Sarabia is bad but when he does contribute it is usually on the right or through the middle so why not play him there as he was no use to anyone on the left.

I probably would have preferred for Di Maria to have a free role as he was the only creative outlet and there was no Neymar to cramp his creativity. 

What on earth was Kimpembe thinking with the red card? I did say he always has brain freeze but someone  tried to say it's a thing of the past.

His deliberate handball and his red card says otherwise. 

Some say he did it because he was trying to preserve the 2-1 score.

I don't understand people sometimes a) how do they know that Leipzig were going to score from that situation as if Poulsen was not still on the pitch to mess it up b) do they have a crystal ball that told them PSG will win in Paris. It's not as though Ramos didn't do this but real Madrid still got knocked out by ajax and his case was more understandable c) even if Leipzig scored cant PSG beat them on a better score at home?

Whatever the outcome PSG are a better side with Kimpembe than without so it was a very stupid thing to do.

Leipzig showed apprehension and uncertainty at the beginning of the game but Tuchel allowed them to grow into the game by doing his usual nothing to take the game to the opposition. 

All in all circumstances beyond his control were at play here which I empathise but it is the inactivity to change the negative way a game is going that galls on fans.

That midfield did not work at home to United even with Neymar and Mbappe so why does Tuchel think it would work without them?

It happens all the time to be ignored.",gb8m7s4,jo5xl4,psg,2020-11-06 00:04:42,denco2019,2

Im just gonna say the truth because someone hqs to say it.

Gueye was a waste of money have to say it. Sarabia don't know what happened to him. Kurzawa was Shit tonight like always. After Bakker playing well and evolving he still puts Kurzawa. Rafinha comes in 5 minutes before the end, Paredes didn't even play, also Ruiz that played well doesn't even come in.

why there are no attacking tactics? why are we playing Marquinhos in midfield in that horrible midfield with Gueye and Herrera?

if we're playing away why didn't we try to keep possession of the ball and force Leipzig to commit, why is Marquinhos man marking Forsberg in midfield leaving our midfield wide open for RB Leipzig to get possession on our 3rd constantly?

why wasn't Tuchel making any substitutions when we were down while Leipzig was making subs.

The group is out of focus and is struggling physically but especially mentally. It happens. Ask Tottenham what happened to them after their champions League final.

Worrying but we should still be able to get out of this group. This are going to fall back to normal within a few weeks. Bad period right now.",gb66ubz,jo5xl4,psg,2020-11-05 07:39:14,Ofthedoor,2

"I’ll post this here cuz the mods deleted it :

**Im f*ckin done with Tuchel**

I’ve been a Paris fan since the 90’s and even thought we’ve have some rough times I’ve never been so disappointed by a coach. 

Let me get this out of the way : I don’t care that he got us to the final, let’s be honest BVB atalanta and Leipzig aren’t Real Liverpool city juve Barca or whatever, and his coaching didn’t have to do with anything.

It’s gotten to a point where I’m genuinely concerned that he’s crashing us to the ground on purpose to get fired and get that sweet money.

We’ve had coaches that I didn’t agree with but this is just a level of absurd I’ve never seen at our club. 

He is the worst coach of QSI history on paper, he has a worst record than Emery, and as far as I’m concerned he did EVERYTHING wrong :
Recruiting, tactics, in game coaching, Marqui/Danilo, his press conferences, everything.

Tuchel out. You will not be missed, get fired you German douchebag.",gb5wiog,jo5xl4,psg,2020-11-05 06:12:34,HugoChinaski,3

But I'm really gutted about the CBs situation and what it means for the post-Thiago Silva era. Kimpembe's game, wtf. I love this player, and his progression since the United penalty, until his recent masterclass performance with the french NT. I thought he was really done with this kind of shitty game, and here we are with a stupid pen and a red card.

"My opinion is that those with withdrawal symptoms for Tuchel should have a thread exclusively for themselves. 

People like me that do not rate Tuchel as highly should be excluded from said threads .

Great is a word that is completely bastardised in the modern world. 

Casual observers that never watch psg unless it is in the latter stages of cl would say he did a great job.

They go completely by stats, they do not watch each game that psg plays for 90 minutes. 

They do not see nor care that players are played out of positions on a constant basis.

Those with potential are not tried to develop them.

If you are liked by the manager then you play no matter how crap you are.

The ones that are not creative are asked to do stuff they are not equipped to do and they invariably fail drawing the wrath of fans with no patience nor understanding of the player's point of view.

The ones that support the club that are in love with this chap seem to be narrow minded towards champions league. 

Its almost like they need to stop being embarrassed by their friends that psg have never gone beyond a certain stage no matter the money spent.

Tuchel took them to the final no matter how so he is ""great"". 

At last PSG has got to the final so I dare not feel inferior to my friends any longer. This is their way of thinking as there is no other explanation to a thread like this.

Funny how Tuchel is great simply because he took psg to a cl final but Pochettino is not good enough because he has won nothing though he took Tottenham hotspur to their maiden cl final.

For those like me that didn't appreciate the great 1, he has been sacked, we got our wish,  its time to draw a line under this and move on.

We keep regurgitating the same stuff it is boring. 

Let's leave these guys to keep going on about his supposed greatness, reminisce about how it was and what might have been.

"Just a few thoughts about current situation. Tuchel sacking was decided in October when Pochettino met with the Prince in Qatar.

Leo didn't sack Tuchel he cannot decide that otherwise he would have don't it a while ago. 

They waited for the right moment to change the coach as we had games every 3 days it wouldn't have been productive. Also the more we waited the cheaper it became.

Tuchel didn't really help with his behavior and recent declaration. Player shouldn't think themselves above the club the same applies to coaches.

Edit: also important information Tuchel shocked the players when he wanted them to stay on the pitch against Istanbul so we could win by forfeiting the other team. It was a non return point for some players.",ghf5ldp,km8gx9,psg,2020-12-30 03:26:13,FeiLongFlameKick,3

Defenses are evolving. Technical ability doesn't mean much when the press picks you apart or the opposing defense swiftly deals with you. Technical abilities also don't help when your midfield gets dispossessed or your defender makes a crucial mistake that creates a dangerous situation for your team.

"He had some great ideas and especially the first months were really promising. He can tactically compete with the best, but that's about it.

On the other hand, I feel bad for him for being born into a poor footballing culture. When he first broke through in the Bundesliga, he was the best coach as well as Klopp and Heynckes. That was the result of everyone else being dinosaurs and incompetents though. After a certain point (little before he started managing Dortmund), I think either his fame as a tactical genius went to his head, or he hit a wall without being able to reinvent himself, so either way, he wasn't too impressive anymore. Great ideas were still there, but after the departure of his three top players, he relied too much on Dembele and Pulisic (like Neymar and Mbappe).

And if he went abroad earlier, I doubt he would have stood out much. Serie A and La Liga are more technically and tactically sophisticated, so he'd struggle. His problem is he's a big fish in a small pond. He's probably still a genius by Bundesliga standards (no shame in being behind Rose and Nagelsmann), but it's only because the rest of the coaches there (except Bosz) are so bad.

And then he became a vegan and took up ""healthy living habits"", lost a lot of weight, yadda yadda. While there's nothing wrong with either, it can be disastrous when you do stupid things you think are ""healthy"". Likewise, I respect decent people who only became vegans for ethical and environmental reasons, but not the misguided people who think such a diet is inherently healthier or more natural than an otherwise balanced diet that includes animal products. That suggests ignorance and lack of critical thinking abilities, both of which are detrimental in any job done with mental effort including coaching. He's the opposite of Wenger, who became increasingly tactically inept after a lot of years, but still comes across as intelligent and insightful in his interviews. On the other hand, Tuchel's just a one-trick pony who's good at countering opponents but otherwise dull and vapid.

There were rumors that he was also forcing low-carb/keto on his players back in Dortmund. One of his players denied these, saying they were allowed to eat anything, but Tuchel also had a habit of lying and going behind his club's back, so he might have been making him lie. If he was actually forcing low-carb and didn't know it was a bad thing, you could say he wouldn't hide it, but he could be if he figured the knowledge of him doing anything weird would be used against him. Also, even if it wasn't low-carb, there was no guarantee that it wasn't a forced vegan diet. The injuries in his last Dortmund season weren't helping his case either.

On one hand, I feel for him for the circumstances his career began under. If he was Italian or Spanish, he would have received a better coaching education and became a more well-rounded manager. But on the other hand, he's an adult and it's his own fault for failing to improve himself and question his methods. I wish he takes a break, gets rid of the compulsion to buy one-dimensional physical beasts, takes a good look at himself and gets the best staff he can get, not the guys he gets along with. And then swallows his pride and takes a mid-table team in a top-3 league.

"He’s leaving a team with no style, which entirely relies on individual performances. No player has improved under his management (you might say Kimpembe but that might have just been his natural evolution, possibly Marquinhos but he was already a great player before Tuchel’s arrival). This season is a disaster on many aspects and I think the club made the right decision. They had to fire him after the last L1 game, which happened to be on the 23rd. 

I’m not blaming him, but he wasn’t the right man for the job, trying to be friends with players like he seemed to be willing when he arrived isn’t like him.

In Europe, I just ignore everyone. We played the teams something like maybe 6 times in 10 years max ? Barcelona ? yes I don’t like them, but I’m more angry of the ref. To say that I hate them ? Well I hate more the Marseille fans that put Barça or Bayern shirts after we lose to them... I hate Marseille fans that are happy when we lose against Leipzig, even though they are on 13 loosing strike. I despite Marseille player putting their star above their logos even though their club won it 30 years ago and most of the players weren’t born.

For Lyon, kinda the same. I hate the fact that they feel superiors to PSG and always saying “we are as big as PSG, we are Europeans as them, we have a better youth system”. Like stop comparing to us, do your life...

"First half was ugly for us, but a lot of things were happening that were sort of going against us. Lille have 4-5 men collapsing on our 3 man mid-field and it makes distribution of the ball when we are in possession impossible. 

Trying to play it out on the flank isn't working which was obvious for the first 30 minutes of the game. Once we started playing more directly and carrying the ball to their last third, only then did Lille start to look really shaky and vulnerable.

Things that need changing for 2nd half within the next 10-15 minutes or so is to bring Mbappe on against tired legs..we need players who can pivot and turn faster in the midfield and I think Bakker should replace Kurzawa. Moise should stay up top and Di Maria shift to the right, Mbappe on the left and have Gana and Veratti stay middle and keep Rafina floating around in the center, Marquinhos push up and maybe take off Kehrer in place for Pembele.

If we play for a draw its not the end of the world, but we should try to win this game...its very tough game so it'll be ugly nonetheless and this is where league winning teams cut their teeth for the trophies.

People who may have faced racism in their lifetime, would not want exclusively their race to be what people see when they're looked at - Not referring to them by race, is part of that.

Istanbul started getting a few yellow cards from reckless fouls. On the last play, Kimpembe went in for a scissor tackle and got a foul, but no card.

"Yeah idk about that. I don’t think we should fire him before the end of the season but idk about next year we’ll have to see if the team improves after the winter break. But acting like it would be criminal to sack him is just as ridiculous as screaming tuchel out constantly. The whole Danilo as CB saga was so dumb. It showed his stubbornness and reflects poorly on him. His substitutions are still very questionable sometimes. Let’s not forget some of the idiotic substitutions he’s made, or waited to long to make in games we were losing. But what frustrates me the most is his refusal to rest our starters or even subbing them off in ligue 1 games and giving almost no opportunities to our youth players. I’m especially talking about Ruiz, fadiga simons and pembele who have shown they have high potential and the skills to start in the league, or at least get subbed in earlier than the 80th minute.

"Finally get to comment on the match.

Why can’t we play like this every week? This is the PSG that we know and love, this is the team that is considered to be among the best in the world.

Man of the Match for me is Neymar Jr. He scored two important goals, as well as an early goal to set the pressure early on Manchester United. He is considered the third best player in the world, and he showed why today.

I won’t blame Danilo Pereira for the own goal. These things are unfortunate, and happen in football. Despite that, I thought he was brilliant in his positioning tonight, being in the right spots for interceptions, and tackles. I also liked Abdou Diallo, especially in the first half, I thought he played well, and did well on that left side.

Kylian Mbappé needs to sort himself out. It has been 1 year since he last scored in the UEFA Champions League, and that is not good for us. He doesn’t lack confidence, he never does, but maybe he should watch some film in order to put himself in the right spots to score more easily. Sometimes he forces things, and that’s not good. 

The only negative I have tonight is something that does not have to do with us. If RB Leipzig had not scored in the 90th minute, RB Leipzig-Basaksehir would have finished a draw, and we would have qualified for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League tonight.",gefhiw9,k5jdxr,psg,2020-12-03 07:34:03,[deleted],3

"Good game overall fron psg . Di Maria was much better but still makes bad decisions and he needs to release the ball earlier at times.

Icardi played well but should have scored with a free header earlier. 

His off the ball movement could be better but hopefully that will come with a few more games under his belt.

His finishing as always is 1st class.

Mbappe did okay . He has to realise that teams regard him as 1 of the world's best so they will always put 2 or 3 players on him so he needs to find a way to get through that.

He needs to utilise his wonderful pace and always try to get himself 1 on 1 with a defender.

Neymar came on and showed why there are few if any better players anywhere in the world. 

Parades of whom I'm not a fan was the man of the match.

Verratti was a bit off his game while I am struggling to understand what exactly Herrera brings to the team.

I hope this is not another Pochettino obsession with sticking by a useless player as he did with Lamela at spurs. 

He intercepted nothing thoughout. These were done by Verratti,  Parades, Marquinhos, Florenzi and even Kurzawa.

Good thing Kimpembe is back as frankly Diallo is substandard.

Marseille played better than they did when they won earlier in the season. 

The referee was just a disgrace. To not send off that despicable Alvaro was disgusting. 

He knows the history so to allow the idiot to get away with such behaviour is something that should never be allowed.

I like the pace of the game and I hope it is not because it was against marseille.

This should always be the attitude and if they can be even quicker but more secure that would be almost perfect. 

Even better if Herrera is not in the starting xi",gj64p0y,kwr0w0,psg,2021-01-14 07:33:30,denco2019,8
"I’m happy with our performance. I thought we played really well in the first half, we had chances, and we converted. Icardi scored a much needed goal, and I’m happy he is back, as he is one of the best strikers in the world. Leandro Paredes is the Man of the Match, for me. Excellent performance, brilliant tackles, and overall bossed the midfield. I hope he is not injured, and that he will be back in training. Glad to have Neymar back, what a brilliant celebration. Very glad to see the Fantastic 4 back on healthy, now I can’t wait until they are on the pitch all at once. Mbappé was a bit better today, although not great, but not bad.

I’m happy with our performance tonight, and it’s the first trophy won under the Pochettino leadership.

"I really liked how well we progressed the ball forward in the first half. Everyone tracked back and defended on counters.

Verratti shouldn't be played out of position. Other than that, I liked what I saw from Herrera &amp; Di Maria - players who has been disappointing this season.

"Seems like Mbappe is having trouble adapting to the teams playstyle. Everytime he gets the ball, he tries to dribble a ton and it's becoming predictable and low percentage (especially against 2 or more defenders). And his passes during break throughs are pretty bad. A good player recognizes when to do a quick pass and when to take on his man. Like highlights look cool, but don't consistently win games.

The first goal was a well executed long pass that split 3 defenders.",gj5uged,kwr0w0,psg,2021-01-14 06:13:02,jamaltheripper,3

It can't be understated just how good Neymar is and his affect on the game. It was also so nice to see Kimpembe back playing...gives major confidence in the defense.

I know we gave up a late goal in the dying minutes of the game, but we never really looked like we were in trouble for the entire match. During the wet and rainy conditions, we held on to the ball and passed it very well. We were far more organized this game then the last two where we looked a little confused. 

A lot of this is to be expected however, adjustment period under new coach and getting players back from injury. This is when we should start to see the team begin to really jell back together again and look more focused and determined.",gj5sa5v,kwnwxv,psg,2021-01-14 05:57:00,sav86,11

"I liked this game, it was enjoyable to watch.

It was a while since we played like this. We were getting chances offensively, we were solid defensively for the most part, I thought we played well overall. A big thing that stands out to me was Marco Verratti, who I thought was the man of the match. It is crucial for Verratti to stay healthy is we want to win all competitions. Brilliant first game back from Mauro Icardi, who many here forget that he’s one of the best strikers in the world. His assist to Sarabia was beautiful, and Sarabia’s goal was an excellent one. Kylian Mbappé is still tying to do to much, in my opinion, and he is still struggling in front of the net, but I thought he was a bit less selfish today. His run to assist Mauro Icardi was brilliant. Keylor Navas had some key saves. Di Maria continues to play poorly, and it’s been a while since he has done so. I still believe in him though, he’ll be alright. Our fullbacks need to go to crossing school.

This Brest team is no joke. They fought, and put a lot of pressure on us. With the opportunities they had, their finishing prevented them from making this a close game, which it was for most of the time.",gip6tlu,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 06:12:08,[deleted],7
"We improved a lot since st etiennes but with until dagba and bakker are replaced I don't think we can do much better. The number of dangerous situation that they waste is staggering. You could see Mbappe's frustration after yet another missed pass by bakker.

Icardi also reminded us what it feels like playing with an elite 9 on the field. I love kean but I fear he'll never be at that level.",gipcg8m,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 06:58:57,tokyotochicago,7
"Pretty good game overall, although I am a bit disappointed for Brest : they played quite well with good intentions and were not rewarded for it (good for us !), but it's miles better than teams like Strasbourg who came only to defend for 90 minutes.

Their pressing really bothered us and we lost many dangerous balls (Gueye lost at least three, Diallo, Bakker, Herrera and Dagba also gave some away). Against a better team like Barça, this could end badly.

Regarding individual performances : 

* Marquinhos was great
* Mbappé still a bit disappointing, although his 2nd half was better. He's always overcomplicating things and could have done better in his first touches
* Really happy for Icardi with a goal and an assist

"Sarabia had a good run today, when DiMa had to drop to midfield due to Gueye's injury it looked better. Draxler wasn't good.

I like it when we can keep a compact block, on offensive phases we were playing regular 433 with Gueye coming up.

I still can't tell if its by design or due to stamina but Verratti is dropping down around his 60mins.

its really nice to see that we can keep a compact block when we have the ball.

Defensively we need a little bit of work, at times Herrera was not moving to cover his side when we lost the ball.

Kurzawa can stay in the bench, and Icardi looks like he will score a bundle of goals once he completely regains his form.",gip6wm5,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 06:12:48,iHATESTUFF_,7
"We won 3-0 against Brest and all I could see is that we’re going to get savagely kicked out of champions league pretty soon with the current level of this team... 

Bakker, Kehrer, Gueye, Herrera, Kurzawa, Dagba... what do you want to achieve with this in the squad... they’re all bang average, can’t cross, can’t pass forward, can’t tackle, can’t defend if their life depended on it. 

We’re going to get punished. Neymar/Verratti/Navas/Marqui/Kimpembe won’t be enough to save us.

Brest had better defensive transitions than us. Their midfield was better, their pressing was better. We’re talking about Brest here...

When Icardi doesn’t have the ball he doesn’t do anything. When he gets served he scores but in champions league you only get served maybe once or twice in 90 minutes. While the rest of the time midfield and defense has to do all the work... I can’t see us have Neymar, Mbappe, Icardi if the front 3 doesn’t press and track back. We know Neymar can track back and defend but the other two...",gipm5n0,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 08:23:11,Rerel,3

"Nothing change from the game against Saint-Étienne for me. Navas is still the best player in this team, Verratti does what he can with a really poor midfield and defense. Glad to see Icardi back. Mbappé is still unreliable both defensively and in offense, his dribble is magnificent but we need to see him succeed more.",gipl451,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 08:14:21,Rerel,2
"I am going to be fair as I was 1 of the ones that gave Tuchel stick.

Psg should not be making heavy weather of beating teams like this.

The problem stems from picking herrera and Gueye in the same team.

It is a recipe for disaster as neither player is capable of playing the ball forward. 

Happy to see Icardi back and scoring. I've always been a fan but let's not get carried away it was only Brest.

Bakker and Kurzawa are just clowns.

As like under Tuchel they still concede too many chances for comfort but it is early days under Pochettino but if he insists on herrera and Gueye, it will keep happening. 

Di Maria was poor yet again while Mbappe was uneven.

His brilliance in setting up Icardi and ingenuity in spotting the goalie off the line from almost half way point were a couple of highlights but his struggles on the right are a worry.

I know I keep harping on it but I don't understand why you need 2 defensive midfielders against Brest at home.

The play was more cohesive than it has been.

I didn't think it fair that Draxler was brought on in the 86th minute.  It is disrespectful and yes he has been crap for Psg but so has been lots of players but they get minutes and are played in their natural position.

Verratti must have done a sliding tackle whilst coming out of his mother's womb. The guy just loves doing it anywhere on the pitch. 

Down at Barcelona Messi and Griezmann are now scoring goals, Dembele is in form and Pedri is drawing rave reviews so it is imperative that Pochettino starts picking the right players pretty sharpish.

Hopefully by his 5th game he'd realise those 2 midfielders should not be 1st choice.",gipabq1,ku0dx3,psg,2021-01-10 06:41:03,denco2019,3
"After watching how we've played this season and the one before I've come to a stance 

It pains me to say it but we should ship Mbappé on a first class trip to Madrid. 

If we get at least $190-$200, we should make an attempt at Haaland, the boy is a pure goal scorer, unselfish, pacey, tall and more sure of his intentions in front of goal. 

A blind woman could tell you, we are in dire need of fullbacks; 

Florenzi has been great but I don't known if we should keep him after the loan? Maybe extend the loan idk but we need someone like Mukiele at our RB who also doubles as a good CB given Marqui is out for whatever reason. 

Bakker is just not it...he could he a decent sub player for us but we need a LB of starting quality, while Telles is in that shit hole in the UK he could of been our player seasons ago, idk what the hell happened there tbh. Theo Hernandez has been looking stella for Milan and we should consider making a move for him (might be too soon for Milan to let him leave tho) 

We need another CB, worldclass yes how possible is the likelihood that we land one, low I imagine...there are the Ramos to PSG rumours afloat right now but who knows. I say we get someone like Konaté (Leipzig) to continue to develop and make him into our super sub, he's a  giant and he's a good at the back, we could try Upamecano instead but I doubt he wants to warm the bench for us. 

Suggestions for CBs????


Our midfield...dear god our poor midfield.


We need a creative and technical player aside from our Maestro, Aour comes to mind and he can very well start to the left of Verratti. 

There's also the up and coming, rising talent Gabriel Martenilli but he's more of a sub player, he can play the Left Midfield, LW and even as a ST. He's cheap, full of potential waiting to be harnessed. 

We need a proper DM, Zackaria, Konrad Laimer and Wilfred Ndidi comes to mind. Great ball stoppers who can also pick a pass and drive the ball up the field IF needed.  There is this American kid Mckennie I think, he plays for Shalke on loan from Juve, he plays CDM/CM and he shows great potential. 

We need at least 1 attacking midfielder but to mainly hold more of a super sub role for when we need that extra attacking edge in our mid, Ihattaren from PSV comes to mind and he can be a straight swap for the once promising but now barely useful Julian Draxler.


Also I fear Di Maria's time here is quickly coming to an end, I think he should not be extended given his dry run of form and we should take it as sign to ship him off while he's hot and worth something. 

Any replacement suggestions????? Aside from Messi on a free transfer.


Also... 

Players that should be sold 

Kehrer,
Draxler,
And
Dagba to some small English club where he could develop into a better player

"We started out quite poor if you ask me and we still have a lot of improve on. The score line really isn't indicative of how we played, more so that Brest fell apart a bit near the end. I know people will take this opportunity to trash Mbappe, but we are so poor at distributing the ball and quickly to the front fast that it basically makes Mbappe all but worthless in most cases. Any missed opportunities or chances that get squandered are just exasperated at that point.

I know Veratti is trying his hardest out there and Di Maria is kind of struggling to find some bit of form, but it's glaringly obvious how much we are lacking in creativity and how desperate we are to get Neymar back out on the pitch. If there is anything that's going to convince our club to open up the coffers and perform a signing 'masterclass' to get Messi, it's going to be with this game.

As for how open we were defensively in most instances, I'm sort of shocked that we didn't concede given how badly opened we were to Brest's pressure. We really need to tidy up back there when we aren't playing with Kimpembe...he is severely missed right now. I would've pegged a bit more organization from Marquinhos, but I think Diallo/Dagba are struggling when it comes to helping defend.

It's very nice to see Icardi back on the field though, his positioning is...so good, it's nice to have someone like that back playing and not grilling for the team on the sideline. I hope Gueye is okay though, him coming off with a slow walk...we really do not need more injuries at this time. Especially when Barcelona are coming into some sense of form and we have yet to find any consistency in our game.

It's important to remember, the players while they maybe under performing overall, we are still with a new coach and learning a new system and dealing with new training regiments. Everything is still sort of influx at the moment. What's good is that we got a win at home with Poch and Lyon decided to fuck it up today and draw level with Rennes.",gipa4ey,ktybw1,psg,2021-01-10 06:39:22,sav86,3

"People are already judging him as he would be a veteran. He is 22 and for last 4 years he had to develop without even having his main position (he had to play on both wings and as a striker). It's hard to develop when you don't have a true position. Also for couple of last years he is obviously trying to develop his game from super dependant on pace to beeing more skillful player with better playmaking and strength. Also if you think that he is invisible in UCL you are mental. Neymar struggled for 60 minutes against Atalanta, Mbappe came and changed the game completely without him we wouldn't have beaten neither Borrussia nor Atalanta. If you think he is putting horrible performances in Ligue 1. Then, sorry what? You sure you aren't watching games from 2011? Mbappe is leading goal scorer in Ligue 1 with 4 assists, without a doubt the best player in Ligue 1 this season. Friendly reminder that he is still leading assister in UCL since 16/17 season.

"Play him on the right wing and he can do good. Also, theres, atleast how it appears and like you mentioned, a sort of identity-crisis. He plays in ways that is not Mbappe - he tries to be someone he is not. This extreme hype has affected him, which I can totally understand. The pressure he has on him is unreal. 

Having said all of this - I have never seen him as a player who can rival the current GOATS, Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar. He is simply not in their racket in terms of talent, in my estimation. Crazy goal stats for a superior team against inferior teams wont change my perception. 

Having said that, I do believe he has something special, and will for sure be A great player - he even is a great player now (when he plays like himself, and the game is set out for his playstyle). His pace and his ability to beat a man 1on1 (on the right wing, if you ask me) can change games. This has been evident in games against Real Madrid, Bayern, Dortmund and so on. 

From where I stand, PSG shouldnt be desperate to sell nor to keep - if he stays, good; if he leaves, ok. Think of the great players one could sign for the revenue gained from a sale.",gijtim9,kt1eq3,psg,2021-01-08 23:46:06,stoptheJR,8

It's just not possible every single game to have him do spectacular things, couple with the fact that we can't provide good quality service to him as of late he's struggling.

A situation that is similar to what Xavi and Iniesta did to Messi after Iniesta was robbed of Ballon d'or. The clubs media team isn't helping matters either. on Twitter and instagram Mbappe is often portrayed as the star of the team, when it is obvious Neymar is.

in the 2nd half I noticed we changed formations with the substitutions but I couldn't figure out the reason why it's fun to start looking for the patterns that make up Poch's tactics.

I also noticed something else, at times our players are so used to having the front 3 produce magic that they don't involve themselves in the offensive build up, at times one of the front 3 would try to pass and some of the midfield players would be caught ball watching and completely miss the play. those things will take time (and maybe different players) to work on.

Also, Thilo Kehrer needs to go. He's absolutely terrible and honestly doesn't have one redeeming quality. Alongside Draxler, he is probably the most useless player we have in the squad.

He'll sell your one-dimensional physical beasts like Gueye or Kehrer that Tuchel saddled you with, replacing them with players with a modicum of technique and football IQ.

The only thing that might get worse is the scouting and tactical flexibility against opponents, but you don't need a lot of flexibility anyway if you're playing well and have a sustainable style/philosophy in place.

Alot of people don't seem to understand that CL and league games are generally completely different styles.

CL is filled with teams that tend to win leagues, and thus more offensive oriented, while the average team league parks the bus and tries to get a draw. By being more offensive oriented, you leave lots of gaps for the other team to exploit, especially fast counterattackers like mbappe and clinical finishers like icardi and kean. That's why the team was so effective against Barcelona.

At this moment, our team is leaning more defensive with midfielders like herrara and gueye than offensive. While it worked well against a offensive Oriented champion league team (we can contain them, while they allow us enough space to be very threatening despite lack of creative players), it struggles to create chances against a parked team in league.

"Our problem always has been midfield even when Tuchel was there and it remains with Poch. Seriously there is no creativity and Herrera is not someone the team can rely on. Against Barca he was just an extra defensive cover in midfield so he didn't have much responsibility. He's good when he has to be 'the extra'. We seriously need someone other than verratti/Paredes.  Even if one of them doesn't start the mid falls down. Hopefully rafinha can be a regular/rotation like he was showing glimpses under Tuchel. If we can get inter rafinha we will be blessed.


Also we are lucky we dropped points to Monaco who are behind us and all the title race teams dropped points last week. We also have chance to destabilise others as we face Lille and Lyon next month, after Barca if I guess correctly. So we are still in it.

"Well this has brought some people back down to earth. The commentator mentioned that psg has not beaten any of the teams in the top 4 this season. 

If that id true then its really awful. 

You learn more about your side in defeats and the 1 positive that I draw from this game that going forward the likes of Gueye and Herrera are a couple of levels below Rafinha  and Verratti .

They are hopeless when you put pressure on them and if Pochettino has not learnt that they are not of the required standard then this defeat would have been in vain and that will make me very annoyed. 

I never ever want to watch another psg match in which Kurzawa is taking a direct free kick.

I honestly don't know why some players take huge risks in their penalty box.

As disappointing as the result was I must say Monaco defended very well and broke well when they had to.

Psg's crossing was woeful.

They just need to go back to the drawing board.

Kean was impressive especially on the wings though the referee kept picking on him.

I know Kimpembe is adored on here but I'm not feeling the guy at all. He does too many silly things for my liking.

Rafinha and Verratti added much needed quality with Verratti especially able to retain possession under immense pressure. 

Why do players like Danilo with no skills think they can score from 35 yards out.

It drives me nuts when they shoot from that distance .

Kurzawa needs to stop acting like he is a number 9 and getting in the way of strikers(he did it twice) in this game.

It can be ignored when there is a victory but very annoying after a defeat.

He cannot even play his position well let alone someone else's.

Excellent performance by Marco Verratti. He played brilliantly as number 10. Paredes was brilliant too, he did what he had to do. Kean displayed effort. We were solid defensively also, very solid.

It was indeed a penalty for Barcelona if we look at the replay. However, if that was a penalty, we also should have gotten a penalty for Griezzman tackle on Mbappé.

I haven't watched more beautiful football since maybe blanc(although against ligue 1 sides)with the one touch pass especially during the second halves' First 20 mins. 



The whole team showed character especially with possession and the way we dealt with their press.


My man verratti is the GOAT of midfield. Also paredes was away from the limelight but gosh has he improved under poch. He is world class at times.


I've never been more happier to see Herrera lol.


The only meh thing would be icardi. The guy needs to be better off the ball and with his decision making. He can be so much better I am not even hating, he's like the kid with so much potential but doesn't use it. Also Danilo in the end gave me some scares.



NOW FOR THE MAN MBAPPE GIVE THE GUY A 555M CONTRACT. The guy scored bangers and went past  three people at times.


BUY KEAN! Even if he didn't score he would have been praised.


Kimpembe pocketed messi again. 


A HUGE STANDING OVATION FOR MBAPPE AND POCH. 

One of the most important thing. Neither verratti nor paredes got a yellow this means they play the second leg.

I'm shocked we bagged 4 goals and only managed to concede a penalty. I'm also stunned that Poch had the sense to make reasonable and timely substitutions that ended up being tactically sound for us. By the time I saw the 2nd goal, I had full confidence that we were going to manage this game and not lose and/or fall apart near the end.

I'm so proud of this team and what it accomplished in this leg tie today...let's just hope we don't repeat history and get it served back to us on the second leg at home. I can't deal with that kind of pain again. Also Keylor with the legit big time near fuck up of his entire career, that mishap with Griezmann...jesus christ my dude.",gnp37n2,llenk1,psg,2021-02-17 06:12:21,sav86,9

Kurzawa had a superb game both defensively and in attack. His best with PSG so far. Paredes...oh.my.god.

The positioning of the defensive block was perfect against Barca and the wings were always well protected. Barca had won 13 round of 16 games in a row at Camp Neu before this game.

"This was glorious. Mbappe hat trick alongside an overall faultless display will undoubtedly take the headlines rightfully so.

Hopefully his haters will hide their heads in shame. He is only 22 mind you but Messi will be sick of the sight of him.

Kean put in a masterclass on the wing and I will not want him to be dropped for anyone in that position. 

Icardi was wonderful though he should have been less selfless on a couple of occasions but he gave a masterclass in centre forward play.

Paredes and Verratti surpassed my expectations though I think against a more vibrant side Paredes will struggle but the boy can pass the ball better than anyone in that midfield. 

Gueye was rightfully subbed as he is a dickhead that thinks he can play.

He is good when he does the dirty work but unlike kante he has no humility, he thinks he should be a playmaker but loses the ball foolishly. 

Marquinhos and Kimpembe excelled as this Kurzawa. Florenzi had a quiet 1st half but was excellent in the 2nd.

Navas almost made the 1st mistake I've ever seen him make for any team he has played for.

Draxler came on and showed what I said pre game that he is the best ball carrier outside Neymar and Mbappe in the squad with a delightful run and cleverly disguised pass to Mbappe for his hat trick.

Even danilo and Herrera almost combined to create a chance which would have made me turn off the TV as that would have confirmed that I was dreaming. 

Man of the match however was the manager. Pochettino take a bow son, you were superb in every aspect. 

He did things that Tuchel never did that drove me mad.

There is no way that Danilo and Kimpembe would not have been the pairing with Marquinhos in midfield with gueye , Verratti (perhaps as you never knew with him) herrera and Sarabia. 

It won't have surprised me to see Mbappe as a lone striker and Rafinha as an additional midfielder so as not to lose or lose big.

Perhaps there would have been a double pivot of Kurzawa and bakker.

But Pochettino went for it and instead of either icardi or kean, he went for both.

He has earned my respect with his game management,  starters and subs were spot on.

Hopefully no more snide remarks by tuchel lovers that think they are insulting the intelligence of those that know their football. 

The football made sense and the result was proof of this. You put players in their natural or comfortable positions everything else becomes simpler.

Marquinhos is a central defender,  he has always been that and should never be played in midfield as that affects the whole squad and how they play.

This was not a superstar bailing out team mates, everyone played their part.

Hopefully those whose love is now at Chelsea and secretly hoping Pochettino fails will now embrace him as someone that can take this club forward.",gnp9fkp,llenk1,psg,2021-02-17 07:01:37,denco2019,8

I gotta say I can't understand why Griezou decided to  sign for barca, they're just wasting him away.....

this was a beatiful game, but I gotta say barca was giving us a lot of space, Paredes was getting so much freedom he could do his thing without anybody troubling him at all.

offensively we were playing 433 with Paredes as a 6 with Verratti on the left as meneur de jeu and Gueye on the right, Gueye was doing his backpass crap and I think Poch screamed at him and he started passing forward which was excellent.

our fullbacks were very on point defensively they weren't overlapping that much specially Kurzawa leaving Kylian the whole left flank to himself where he ran riots around farza and also **he was cutting in!!**.



Defensively we swapped to 4141 and is were the interesting bits happened we gave their back line space and as soon as they would release into the midfield our midfield and defense line would collapse and press their midfield hardcore, Verratti had the task of closing the passing lanes to de Jong, showing him whos the boss.

this may sound like a broken record but Poch's ability (and style) to keep our team playing in a compact block is all I wanted the team was very compact making our passing crisp.",gnq9f7n,llenk1,psg,2021-02-17 12:15:07,iHATESTUFF_,2

"Not really confident.
Barca are going to be full of confidence after their match against Alaves, have an incredible midfield and Messi and Griezmann are in top form at the moment. 

To be honest, I don’t really expect much from our team this season. We have just changed coaches, the team is incredibly unbalanced, two of our most important players are injured for this game, the team’s physical condition isn’t great. Also we are playing terribly at the moment, we are unable to control the game properly, there’s no play style or identity.
I wouldn’t be surprised to see us lose against Barca. But football can also be surprising. With an incredible Verratti, Navas, Marquinhos and Mbappé, things can go quite differently.

I’ll judge Pochettino when he gets more time to install his ideas, but I’m really far from convinced from what I’ve seen. We are incredibly weak, are giving away way too many opportunities to our opponents, our play style is really disappointing, and our players very poorly inspired.",gndx7za,ljm93y,psg,2021-02-14 19:27:27,HaaamGirl,12

How is your right flank guys?  Messi will be trying to hurt You there by sending pinpoint passes to overlaping Griezmann/ Alba. This is their best, consistent offensive move.

On the other hand Barca defense is really vulnerable on counters and crosses. They have trouble to defend against strong i tall players.",gner51r,ljm93y,psg,2021-02-14 22:35:44,Appropriate_Ebb6022,5
"I've seen this time and time again, we look like shit and our opposition looks to be in top form in the prior games leading up to the match. It's enough to make you nervous, because we see how we play on the regular and for the most of us, we only catch the highlights/goals of our opposition. The former never tells the entire story. 

What we do know is that both teams have new coaches and have had their moments struggling throughout this season. There are a lot of uncertainties coming into this game. I'd argue that from an objective standpoint, we are much more worse off then Barca at this very moment.

If there is anything that I've learned in my time watching Champions League games, is that we won't know how either team will play on Tuesday because these games are like derbies...they exist in their own of bubble, so they can be unpredictable.

What we do know is that Barca have been struggling defensively, but they're attack has been aces as of recent, in addition to that they have their x-factor world destroying player, Messi. It doesn't help that they also have Griezmann and Dembele who have come into form of recent.

If we still had Neymar, we would be like for like, but with his omission we are lacking in the firepower, but what we do have is a strong midfield (assuming Veratti is playing) and a much better defense, I fully expect Marquinhos and Kingpembe to shine for this tie. I'm uncertain how Danilo will slot in...but he's going to have to put in his best ever performance of his career if we are going to have a chance.

All of that is to say...have some faith, we've been in worse off situations than this. It's a two game tie so even if we flounder on the first tie, we can recollect ourselves in the next.",gnfm29s,ljm93y,psg,2021-02-15 00:42:49,sav86,4

"Like Poch is any better tactically lol we’ve been trash for weeks. Poch is a clown. He’s gonna go to Barca either with a Verratti-Paredes pivot which is already stupid or even Verratti at 10 which has never worked. Instead of adapting to the team he’s forcing his ideals that clearly don’t match with this team material, very stubborn guy. It’s already known that this team is mentally weak without Neymar evident in the loss against Man Utd C team. Also the referee is Kuipers who’s a known Barca supporter like everybody else in the Netherlands. Literally everything is against us the only way we go through is if the players want it more like when we played v Chelsea with 10 men when Zlatan got sent off. But I don’t see it happening. This team has no veterans with mentality like Motta, Maxwell, Silva to depend on. WE’RE OUT.

"Maybe now people will realize Tuchel wasn't the problem. Nice could've easily scored 3 or 4 goals if they were more clinical. 

It's so embarrassing hearing the commentators say "" X isn't playing like a team in X position"" because it's us that are playing like a bottom table team. 

This 442 formation just isn't working under Poch. I don't think I've ever seen the team this clueless defensively. We can't cope with bottom table teams' pressure and make silly mistakes. Can't play out from the back and the pressing is so poor the midfielders and the full backs just end up getting caught out of position. 

Also it seems nobody really knew who to mark. So many times 2 players will mark the same person while another will be free.

But we fought, and overall we played well. Top performances from Leandro Paredes(who I thought was man of the match), L. Kurzawa, and Draxler. Kehrer was also solid, for once. Marquinhos was at fault on that goal, but I’m thankful that Kean scored to take the lead. The cross from Mbappé to Icardi, and the connection  between Icardi and Kean was majestic.

"Barcelona's most three important players ( Messi , De Jong , Mats ) are fully fit. On the other hand our three most important players ( Neymar, Verratti , Navas ) are either injured,doubtfull or unfit. We have no attack , no midfield , only our defense is decent/good.

"Have faith guys, we have two teams that are struggling going into Tuesday. If any Barca fans are reading this, we know we are just as equal as Barca, going into this match. Losing Neymar is definitely a setback, but it's not the end of the world. This doesn't change the desired outcome for us, we want to win, and if we are going to do it, we have to put it all out their on the pitch, on the line.

The players will have a tough task ahead of them, but they will be more motivated and driven to win despite the Neymar loss. We have to have faith that our coach Poch will inspire this team to success and glory. While this might be Poch's true first test, we have to trust in his judgement and lineups for the game.

This club has endured a lot of setbacks in the past decade, we have been here before and will do it again, try as we might...survive if we can, this is where players will earn their metal and grit in the toughest competition of this sport. The beauty of soccer is that it's unpredictable and savage at times. As great of a player Messi is, even he can't win it by himself...so why do we think losing Neymar is the end all for us?",gn2nm0r,li50nj,psg,2021-02-13 00:35:58,sav86,5

I think that The game against barcelona will be like against atalanta. We're only going to use counter attack using mbappe speed and kean will be a better option to play by his side,gn1szu9,li50nj,psg,2021-02-12 19:55:24,TsubasaMt,6
"Stopping the Messi - Alba axis is very important so if it was up to me I'd play Mbappe on the right to stop Alba always bombing forward. 

Mbappe 's presence there will put a halt to that due to fear of his pace in counter attacking.

I agree that kean should be played instead of Sarabia but we all know Pochettino will not do that.

In midfield id have Verratti (if fit), Danilo and Rafinha but I think Pochettino will go for Verratti,  Parades and Gueye which in my view is asking for trouble as only Verratti can withstand press and Danilo is best in helping out the defence .

Nightmare scenario no Neymar, di Maria, Verratti and navas.

Barcelona may be having a poor season but they have a great cl pedigree and in Messi they have quite possibly the best cl player of the last 15 years.

Underestimating them will be very foolish especially with Neymar out.",gn1sa1u,li50nj,psg,2021-02-12 19:45:10,denco2019,5

"That team is painful to watch jesus. So many bang average players. Sarabia and Draxler are stealing a living with us. They're hiding all game long, I can't believe we let Diaby and nkunku go for them.

I've had my fair share of criticisms toward bakker and I still think he's nowhere near good enough, but he's giving his all and I respect that. It also must be hard to combine with somebody like Neymar, who cannot play simple in games like that.

I dont know what to say about Kerher. At this point I'm just curious that he hasn't been replaced by some youth player. The worst I've seen in a PSG shirt, and I was there to witness our lord Apoula play.

Neymar shouldn't be here in the first place, no idea what pochettino is thinking, he's the only one who can save that sorry group.

Given how poorly the league is going and how stale our usual replacement are, why not try some youth player in a game like that. Simons and cie can't surely be worse than Sarabia, Draxler, Dagba...

Surprised with how good Danilo was though. If we forget about Kerher's disasterclass, the defense is very solid and that gives me a lot of hope before Barcelona.

All in all, the game was shit, Pochettino's system doesn't seem to be working at all for now, we're still scoring through fast transition plays like Tuchel wanted. I dont think poch will try anything new or too daring before the summer when he'll have time to prepare his own system for the team. So I expect a very similar game to what we did last year in the CL.

"This resembled a Ligue 1 game than a Coupe de France game, it had the physicality that a typical Ligue 1 game has.

Overall, it was a disappointing performance from us, even though we won. They were basically parking the bus, but still, almost 80% possession in the first half but only 1 shot on target, we need to to better than that against such opposition. Things were a bit better in the second half, Draxler unfairly had his goal cancelled because the referee incorrectly thought Sarabia was offside. The worse thing is that Neymar Jr. is now injured, his adductor according to Tanzi, hopefully it’s not serious, since he managed to walk off the pitch. 

It was really great to see **Xavi Simons** make his debut for the club tonight, but I thought he didn’t really do much. He had one misplaced pass that almost led to a Caen goal. I forgive him though, it was his first appearance for the club, he was most likely very nervous. Also, I never realized how tiny he was.

Finally, Thilo Kehrer makes too many mistakes. He needs to be a bench player at most.

"Passing the ball quicker and I like the off the ball runs. 2 incorrect offside calls against Mbappe. 

Best game by di Maria in a while but it must be said that Nimes have been abject.

Every attack they have conjured up has been through errors by Kehrer. The guy is just really terrible. He is pacy but gets beaten for pace. He can't pass the ball and yet he keeps trying to do then losing possession. 

Bakker and Dagba are just no good at all.

Paredes running midfield and if Gueye could stick to winning the ball back he'd be half decent .

"I am a big sports fan and I live in America. I always wanted to get into soccer but never knew what team to support or how to watch and follow because it is not very popular here. I had always heard about PSG since their merger with Jordan Brand but that was the extent of what I knew.

My love for soccer and PSG started just recently during quarantine here in the states. We had more time at home, and there were no sports going on here. That gave me time to really study the game, familiarize myself with the different leagues, cups, and watch highlights of players. As a child, once of my fondest memories was a trip I took to Paris. I fell in love with the city, culture, fashion and food. It felt only right that I support a Parisian team. That lead me to finding out that Mbappe, the hero of the World Cup who I just faintly remember from a few years back, was on the team. I was mesmerized by his highlights. I had to be a PSG fan. Then I remembered Neymar was on the team so it became a double bonus. I fell in love.

I watched all the matches dating back to when Mbappe and Neymar joined. I am now a full on die hard supporter.

I hate OM, people who discredit Ligue 1, and people who shit talk Neymar.

I thought about being a Beyern fan (pre CL final) or a Hotspur fan. But I gravitated towards PSG.

Allez Paris

"I'm having trouble understanding how Poch could have fielded a midfield of Danilo and Paredes last game. I mean, mobility wise, how could he think it could work ? I think Paredes works great but only if paired with Marco, who's game intelligence and skills can make Leo shine.

Another point : the subs. Why did he wait so long before subbing anyone in ? People crapped all over Tuchel's subs, which were often eyebrow raising worthy, but Lorient changed 3 players around the 50th - 60th, while Poch waited till the end of the match. And then he goes on to say the players were gassed because of intensive training. So... why did he not rotate earlier.

Last point : what's up with Rafinha &amp; Keane ? Both were our best players at the end of the 1st half of the season. I know Rafinha caught COVID, but he is back now. Why insist with Di Maria who clearly is close to a liability right now on-field, and Mbappé who was clearly not in his best day and not sub in Rafinha who could have controlled the game in our favor or Keane and his physicality ?",gll2et8,l9wbe4,psg,2021-02-01 18:36:46,HaaamGirl,10

"Today's game was the first I've watched since the beginning of the season (I hated the way we were playing and had to take a break for family issues). 

How did we fall so low in half of a season?  I noticed a lot of the same issues that I noticed at the beginning of the season (Verratti is the only creative midfielder we have, Presnel isn't strong/smart enough to lead the back line, Thilo Kehrer should never have been given a PSG jersey, Mbappe's only gift seems to be speed, but he has to be fed and have a clear path before he will utilize it, Neymar is forced to be the only creative person on the pitch when Verratti isn't playing, the players look exhausted by the 25th minute, Mbappe and Icardi do not know how or just refuse to draw defenders to create some space for Neymar, we should've extended Thiago Silva's contract because our back line is an absolute humiliation of a wreck).

The only difference that I noticed was that the back line is playing higher up the pitch, which didn't exactly work well for us today.

If the main complaint with Tuchel was that he just passed the ball to Neymar all of the time, how has Poch improved that? Neymar was the only player of ours who was really in the game today.",glk433l,l9hndm,psg,2021-02-01 11:41:17,silvaslips,3

We have yet to play at full 100% capacity, we've always been left without some one on the field whether it was due to injury or cards and with the change of coach/management in the middle of the season and other factors such as covid and difficult compact schedules...I can't in good conscious criticize the team right now.",gr34inb,m5wgjj,psg,2021-03-16 11:31:48,sav86,1

"Neymar qualified us he basically saved Tuchel. Now we are playing without Neymar... the best 10 in the world. Of course the team will loose quality and dynamism up front. At least Poch doesn’t play Marqui in the midfield that’s already a step up. Now his best player isn’t on the pitch and he has to work with some players that are currently borderline at the level in champions league. 

Take off KDB at City and they’ve got the same problem, Messi at Barcelona, Ronaldo at Juve, Fernandes at Man U etc... 

I’d rather wait and judge when we have the full team on the pitch and they’ve got a couple of games played in a row together. 

We still have one of the strongest « colonne vertébrale » in the world with Navas Marqui Verratti Neymar M’bappe so I wouldn’t stress too much after 2 bad games. We need them all on the field and in top form. They raise their teammates level and moral instantly. 

Ps: I’ll never forget or disrespect Tuchel though I did live some amazing moments in our run to the champions league final that I’ll never forget.

Poch got tactically outclassed by Koeman and didn’t change anything during the match bar the obvious Gueye and Kurzawa substitutions what is there else to say.

"I find that all the players seemed lost (just see the example of Verratti's positioning) yet Koeman's tactics were known, He recently played in 3-5-2 with Messi and Griezmann who move between the lines for  leave dembele in the middle and the lanes for dest and alba. I find that pochettino did not prepare well for the match upstream by keeping the same tactics and during the match he did nothing to try to readjust because apart from the  4-2-1-3 it has nothing to work. A lot of players played badly like our full-backs who were taking waves without being able to get help otherwise you depopulated the midfielder. The attackers were absent and in particular mbappe who is  return to the wrong place instead of doing like the first leg where he was defending with his side, he made several calls even if he was not served etc. Draxler and Icardi it is a neutral or even negative contribution Paredes is the worst because  he lost balls easily and defensively he helped  otherwise thank you navas, Marquinhos and Kimpembe.",gqjuwl3,m2jjyv,psg,2021-03-11 16:33:14,mohrbix,3
"If we forget Navas, Marquinhos and Kimpembe, Diallo was our solid fourth best player on this match. I usually like Kurzawa (as a backup) but I had doubts it he can fight against both Dembélé and Dest without Kean who can track back and well... My doubts has been confirmed, but Diallo was rock solid and changed the match by himself.

Otherwise offensively we were objectively horrible, but defensively I think we were ok. It's remind me a bit the approach from United on their comeback where the team don't care about the possession but instead try to use the mistake from the opponent (without the success on this case).

Too much space has been given by Kurzawa and exploited by Dembélé, but I don't see that much players who, or as the same qualities as Dembélé with a stronger finishing (except maybe Mbappé), or a real killer in front of the goal with the velocity and dribbling qualities than him.

Also I would like to see PSG a bit more cynical, if we don't play possession I wouldn't mind that we become full Mourinho or full Allegri.",gqjub5h,m2jjyv,psg,2021-03-11 16:26:05,Yiurule,4
Who would you like to get next round?,gqjodsz,m2jjyv,psg,2021-03-11 15:19:40,Fee-Visual,1
"I think it's time to part ways with Kurzawa. Over 2 legs he cost us 2 penalties on fouls he could have clearly avoided by just staying focused on his positioning. The first leg foul with the clipping on De Jong you can argue it's unlucky but I think there is a consistence lack of focus from the player. As soon as Diallo came in we got stronger defensively. Kurzawa can either be repositioned as a left winger/backup of Mbappé or we can simply not play him in Champions League games. 

Draxler was a complete ghost for 60 minutes. No defensive help, no effort to help in the midfield against Barca's pressing. He was wasting a spot the entire time he played on the pitch. Same problem as with Kurzawa, inconsistent, unreliable in important knockout games. Di Maria came him and created more motion on the ring wing instantly. Draxler looks physically weak, broken, like he doesn't want to make the effort, at 27 years old you would expect him to run a lot more. 

Paredes completely missed this game. Completely suffered from Barca's pressing. It's not the first time he fails to resist against a team that presses a lot in CL: Madrid, Man United, Barcelona, Liverpool, Bayern are examples. When he is 2 meters away from the ball you see him walking, you don't see him rushing. Last night, he looked like he was protecting himself, saving himself from physical effort = laziness. We can't afford that in CL and that's a clear example on why. 

We really missed Kean last night in my opinion. Icardi and Mbappé didn't have a good game over 90 minutes. Icardi gets the penalty because of constantly waiting in their box. Appart from that I didn't like what I saw from Icardi personally. Mbappé got more pressing from Dest and Barca overall so he didn't do what he wanted on the left wing.",gqjmdvo,m2jjyv,psg,2021-03-11 14:58:32,Rerel,17

"I think we shouldn't be too hard on the team.    
You need to manage your levels of energy in football, the extraordinary first leg was draining (we immediately lost to Monaco after) and probably cost us in the medium term. It was pretty obvious that Barca were hungry coming in the game while we were to play more conservatively.     
Ofc I didn't expect the gap to be this big in the first half, I was shocked by our midfield (Verratti especially), but there was no question for me that Barca would dominate and that we would rely on Mbappe for counters.    

Knowing that I think Pochettino made a mistake by fielding Kurzawa and Florenzi (our more offensive options) instead of Kehrer and Diallo, I think also that Icardi is horribly useless with clueless positioning and lack of focus/energy, Sarabia would've been a more versatile option, it's also quite obvious that Kean was dearly missing with his massive amounts of energy.       

But Pochettino righted the ship after the 1st half, probably gave a good psychological boost and made good subs (I wish he took out Verratti immediately after Paredes yellow, Marco was restless and looked out of his depth, really ready to make a dumb mistake).      

Now that we passed the psychological hurdle of 1/8th against Barca no less, I think the team should be relieved and can focus on finishing well in Ligue1, everything that'll come in CL will be a bonus for me because the big 3 teams (Bayern, City and Liverpool) are still quite above us and we'll need luck in draws and our ties to advance further.",gqk25fh,m2j81g,psg,2021-03-11 18:06:24,deepfrench,7

"Overall Poch chose a defensive strategy, where we parked the bus and basically didn't even bother with attacking. It worked even though it didn't look pretty. None of Barca's chances were that good apart from the penalty. Ironically, their only goal came from like one out of two times they shot from range. Poch also made nice adjustments after half time and it looked like Barcelona gassed out while we brought fresh subs in.

I'd argue this is good strategy against most teams not named Bayern and Barca, who are at the top of the rankings in offense. Giving them possession makes them a lot more dangerous. However, they clearly lacked finishing (which is generally a tradeoff since most midfielder-like attackers can't shoot or finish, like Verratti and Rafinha for us). Nevertheless the strategy worked. The final score was only 1-1. Probably could have gotten have 1-2 or 0-2 (we would have still went through), but probabilistically it was a good strategy, just a bit risky.

Also remember, we basically played the game without our best player Neymar and also Kean, was is much better in this matchup than Draxler. Furthermore Florenzi was basically playing injured (Poch didn't want to play Kehrer accroding to l'equippe.) and Di Maria is not fully fit.",gqhzvh9,m29y15,psg,2021-03-11 06:03:06,jamaltheripper,6

"No doubt about it, we were shit in the first half, we looked unnerved and way too cautious. It invited Barca to play their game and do what they do...I'm not happy with how we played that first half and I expected much better. Second half we were significantly better, we actually did something with the ball, but we were so poor in our final passes that it didn't amount to anything for us except for one arguably clear cut chance for Mbappe near the end.

What we did do well in the second half was prevent Barca from scoring, we let them danced around our box and inside of it, but we never gave them the shooting outlets to score. Maybe it was a combination of their poor finishing and our ability to stifle and block their shots that helped us see it through to the end of the game...I'll take it.

I'm glad we didn't repeat 2017, it may not have been beautiful football and it may not have been our best game, but this is how the sport goes sometimes. Keylor easily MOTM for us, putting in the work to keep us alive.

"This was really disappointing from the 1st minute. It was an almost complete reversal of the 1st leg.

Psg start very well, Barcelona with Messi scores a penalty out of nowhere then Mbappe equalises with a great goal then goes on to get his hat trick.

This time Mbappe scores a penalty to go an undeserved 1 goal up, Messi scores a scorcher but misses a penalty that put paid to his chance of getting a hattrick. 

Very poor game management by Pochettino and I hope he never does this crap again.

It is a very bad idea to start a game on the back foot just because you are 4-1 up.

Marquinhos and Kimpembe were great especially the former.

Navas did great in stopping the penalty but apparently it should have been retaken.  Something to do with Verratti. I missed what Hoddle and the BT sports presenters were saying.

He did seem nervous with his kicking out and on 1 occasion punched the ball that was so easy catch. Very strange from a multi winning cl player.

Diallo was fantastic when he came on for that complete liability Kurzawa. 

Gueye proved yet again why I keep giving him stick. He lost the ball unnecessarily that led to Messi's goal.

He did it again as his 1st touch is poor which leads to him losing possession. 

Icardi lost the ball but he was the only 1 apart from the guys I mentioned that showed any desire.

He harassed and pressed the entire defence. 

I love Mbappe to bits but his attitude tonight was totally unacceptable. 

He showed very little desire to help the team, gave the ball away alarmingly and needs to cut that out of his play. 

Verratti was awful, holding onto the ball longer than necessary and making bad passes.

Draxler should have done better but he was not bad.

I don't rate Paredes as highly as some on here so his poor performance against top quality midfielders didn't surprise me.

I never in my entire being thought Barcelona stood a chance but they had chances to not just score 4 but win the tie.

Not just half chances huge chances.

Busquets rolled back the years but he would because psg was defending so deep.

Di Maria came on and I thought he will do something but he was hopeless outshone by Diallo and Danilo. 

This side needs players that will scream at them to let them know that loose play is unacceptable especially at this level.

I hope they are all disappointed especially the manager and I will be annoyed to see selfies celebrating this qualification. 

So far Pochettino has only coaxed 1 good performance from this side and that is not just good enough. 

From the optimism of the 1st leg performance to the despair of this rotten performance. 

It does not bear thinking about what is Messi scored that penalty to put them 2-1 up . Good thing for psg that the so called GOAT is somewhat weak mentally. 

His head and performance dropped significantly in the 2nd half.",gqi8nd2,m29y15,psg,2021-03-11 07:13:13,denco2019,4

Rest of the team... well, I guess they followed the tactics set by the coach with this style of the game. Extremely frustrating is watching our forwards just looking around when their defenders are passing the ball. Icardi probably tried the most to put them off with a bit of a pressing. Congrats to Mbappe for executing penalty, at least we did not lose. Imo midfield was poor, even Verratti did not look like his usual self. I wish we would have fought as much as in the first leg but maybe Poch decided not to ""overwork"" the team and played safe. Not the most beautiful match to watch for sure and, that's just my opinion but I'm quite disappointed by our performance but beside that we are in the quarter finals, it's the most important thing right now.

"ok today I noticed some things tactically that were different. defensively they did not press the first half and were on their usual 4141 and the midfield tried to box (seriously 4 players in square shape) the barca midfield. but since barca was playing 4 + griezou who is a beast, they always had an outlet pass to the wing.

Florenzi had a rough match, he needs rest, Diallo is currently our best LB. Kylian walking around still pisses me off, Di Ma was not 100%, Danilo was beast when he came in, Marquinhos needs to scream even more.

sometimes I wonder if the team still needs a mental jolt. but specifically today I don't know if Poch wanted to give up possession.

We get pressed like in Ligue 1 and suddenly we look ordinary again. There’s no way we beat any top team even when Neymar comes back. Pochettino is a clown. Disgraceful game. This Barca team is not good and we looked like Dijon out there. Can you imagine if Barca set up like this in the first leg. That first game was definitely a fluke Barca gave us all the necessary tools to succeed I.E not pressing Paredes and Gueye giving Mbappe loads of space to run into while also not having Dembele covering for Dest. I’m really interested to see how we go head to head with a team like Bayern or Man City who actually know how to press. We’ve played two teams with a back 5 Man Utd and Barca and both times we looked void of ideas everytime time instead of keeping the ball it was “launch the ball to Mbappe”. Before the game Poch talked about attacking. There was zero initiative even after the lucky pen we got. This was a carbon copy of a Emery match. We have to thank the footy gods that we have Navas.

Such a bad match imo. They could have already had few goals tbh. They had a crossbar and Messi had one chance but he slipped. If we continue like this they will score again. Especially if our aces will foul them in penalty area. Attack pretty much does nothing but also gets almost zero help but I don't like how our front players are just walking around when their defenders are passing to each other instead of pressing them a bit. On the other hand I can't state enough how much I love Keylor Navas. My king.,gqhr5x5,m25v1b,psg,2021-03-11 04:59:23,Desire_Is_Power,9

-Kurzawa is terrible and should be replaced with Diallo
-Gueye: hasn't been great 
-Paredes: I love him but he isn't playing well at all this first half
-Draxler: haven't seen much from him
-Mbappe: making decent runs
-Icardi: he's been great off the ball
-Verratti: good defense but he can make more chances
-Marquinhos: saved our asses but he's been a bit shaky
-Kimpembe: needs to put more effort

"I think it's important to say, for new and old PSG fans and supporters, is that this game probably will not be like the first leg. Barca are going to be more intense and are going to try everything to win. They are put into a do or die situation, they're focus is clear, they have to attack, they can not defend...so expect them to be intense and relentless. 

Their desperation could play into our favor or it could prove to be detrimental. This is where the players and coach earn their medals...only time will tell if the tactics, and mentalities brought to the pitch will be enough to see out a win. We've been here before, we've had almost statistical certainties that would guarantee us through, vanish in an instant...let's make sure we get the win today and bring the pain.

"Story of qualifying:

Paris Saint-Germain is set to host Barcelona at the Parc des Princes for the return leg of the UEFA Champions League. Up 4-1 on aggregate, Paris remembers very well their last match against Barcelona, and are desperately looking to avoid a similar result by ensuring qualification to the Quarter-Finals of the UEFA Champions League. To make the evening even more magical, the Parisians are looking to replicate the score from La Remontada, but this time with themselves on the winning side. Can Paris Saint-Germain put their past behind them by defeating Barcelona to advance to the Quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League?

Match Objectives:

•	⁠Win

•	⁠Avoid defeat

•	⁠Score 6 goals, while conceding no more than 1.",gqh7t63,m1f75r,psg,2021-03-11 02:43:41,[deleted],3
"D-day : odds and dynamic largely in our favour but anything can happen in football.      

A couple of things I want us not to do :     

- CHOKE   
- and CHOKE   
   
Seriously though, we must be smart and mentally solid :     

- We bottled against Manchester United when we had nothing to do but let Mbappe score a couple of goals on counters, but we played for possession and the win (because ""it's our DNA, it's PSG in Paris blabla, il faut les salir, etc""), they scored a couple of goals on counters (and massive mistakes), one Bernat and one UEFApenalty and a lot of mental weakness sealed our fate.     
- We lost against Monaco 0-2 easily falling for the same trap, going for fruitless possession while the opponent smartly countered us, even if they needed the win as much if not more than us.      

But I am confident with Pochettino, because he brought with him a couple of helpful things for situations like these :     

- He coached underdogs and he knows you can win games by fast counter attacks. I hope he'll make us more versatile and less predictable.     
- His psychological skills should support our players if things should go quickly awry (imagine a couple of early goals and tons of dubious referee decisions) and avoid another Chernobyl.

Good game to City, major credit to them, we knew even when they went down that they'd remain calm and collected and focused. We are literally our worst enemies in these very tactical games and we just made it a whole lot worse for us.

At this point my realistic expectations for the second leg is utter pure chaos and not to play to City's strengths. I fully expect a very motivated and driven PSG to at the very least try and score away. I'm literally baffled as to what had changed from halftime to have us play so poorly.

It’s like they never practiced defending walls or something… 

Why would you put Verratti on the ground if the entire fucking wall is moving. Just block the damn ball…

"This is a fucking disgrace. I’m beyond pissed.

The game was lost in the second half. The first half was good, we did what we had to do, and we played well. The game was lost in the second half. It was disgusting. A schoolboy error by Navas, and a wall that was utterly shameful were the cause of our two goals today. We never conceded a goal from a free-kick, and Navas never makes those types of mistakes. City was not better than us today. 

I’m most angry at Mauricio Pochettino though. He made absolutely no tactical changes in the second half. He made two subs today, and one of them was because Idrissa Gueye acted like an idiot and got sent off. We needed to score, but Pochettino puts Ander Herrera, who offers no creativity in the midfield, and does not even put on Mauro Icardi, who’s one of the best strikers in the world, or Kean, who really could of helped us.

Luckily for us, we still have a chance to go to the finals. However, we’ll need to win in Manchester. A draw won’t be enough, unless it’s a very high scoring game. There is still hope, and a good chance at qualification. Ici c’est Paris.",gw7wkz7,n0ok2x,psg,2021-04-29 05:04:40,[deleted],9

I honestly think we lost the game because of Poch coaching. He clearly saw that the team was struggling in second half but changed nothing.

He is chasing the ball then suddenly stops lmfao. He can't do shit. I'm so fucking mad... How can people in the wall act so stupid. Kimpembe and Paredes fucked up so bad, mostly Kimp. What did he imagine to turn like this.  Are you scared to take the ball on yourself? Then what are you doing there... After such a great first half, we lost us a match. Neymar and Di Maria were both very good, they tried so much. They were helping everywhere. Mbappe was invisible the whole second half, the first wasn't much better. Also, what was Poch's plan for the second half? Why did we play so passive? It was 1-0, not 3-0 to play on our own half. Why did he wait so long to make a change. Why did he let Bakker play till the end knowing that he puts his own teammates in difficulties. And then Gana takes red... Some of our players act like amateurs.

I don't know. It's going to be so hard to qualify now. And it's after we had this match in our hands. We are once again losing on our own. I don't understand this. This team is mental, really.",gw7y3vv,n0ok2x,psg,2021-04-29 05:15:47,Desire_Is_Power,5
"I had to miss a lot of the start of the season, so I'm still not sure why we got rid of Tuchel.

I am not a Poch fan, but I have given him the benefit of the doubt *until now*. Parking the bus for an entire half when your strength is in your offense is just ridiculous. 

Also, he needed to sub Gueye off earlier; both Gueye and Paredes are known to garner plenty of yellows and occasional reds, they played hard, and it was getting really dirty. Poch should've seen that red and yellow coming from a mile away.

And what was his brain thinking when he subbed off Fideo???? Fideo is our greatest for assists, he was having a great game, and Poch took him off. Why not remove Mbappe (who was, once again, invisible) and leave DiMa on so we could have a chance at scoring????

And lastly,  HOW MANY MORE YEARS WILL WE GO WITHOUT REPLACING MOTTA AND MAXWELL????? Bakker and Kurzawa shouldn't be on our squad, and Diallo (because he's made of glass) should only be a backup. Paredes is just muscle and rage; we need a Thiago Motta type (muscle, pace-setting, and occasional rage).

I can't blame our loss on our players, because I really think the coaching was the problem. Mbappe and Bakker were disappointing, but they usually are. I can't blame Bakker, because he's so young, and he just isn't at this level -- I blame all of the Athletic Directors since Maxwell left for not taking our fullback situation seriously.

For everyone who still thinks Mbappe is the next Messi or Ronaldo, please watch all of our huge games again. Mbappe is greedy with the ball, he doesn't defend, he rarely draws away defense so someone else can make a play, and he rarely builds any kind of play.

"First off all credit to Manchester city for staying the course and pressing for 90 minutes regardless if they were down or not. Paris beat them at their own game in the first half but second half looked we got sloppy. I wouldn't necessarily blame Bakkar Kimpembe or even Gueye for that matter. The first half was quite good but the issue remained...PSG could not finish in the final third. Besides a beautifully played corner kick, the offense was non existent. The midfield play and build up was magnificent but City responded in the second half and pressed with more authority and stayed home on the Florenzi wing runs. That first half was really opened up by Florenzi catching Foden sleeping more than once defensively when they were pressing.

I do agree that PSG did let their foot off the gas pedal quite a bit in the second half but City just played much better overall. They kept the pressure and never let up. And even when they scored two...they were looking for more! PSG has these 15-20 minute lapses every single game that just boggle my mind. I mean just look at the Bayern first leg game! Up 2-0 and they let Munich bring it back 2-2. It is quite frustrating and PSG is much better than what they showed in that second half especially that awful tackle by Gueye. I mean come on, what was that?!

Finally, Let us also acknowledge this is two world class titans duking it out, someone has to lose and overall the game left a lot to be desired especially for us as PSG fans having a home game. But the goals were so flukey. I agree with some have said 2-1 with a red card was almost a best case scenario at that point in the game, it could have gone way worse. PSG has to clean it up and play more consistent. Besides the wall blunder, the defense was stellar. Marquinhos is top class. Di Maria is an absolute wizard in huge games and he deserves so much credit for how well he played today as well. Florenzi was great as usual too.

I pray they come with the energy and chip on their shoulder like they did at the Camp Nou against Barcelona. We really need that.

Neymar is, as always, confident af heading into this game, and why shouldn’t he? He continues to dominate against the best teams - today will be no exception.

Honestly bruh we just gotta score more before City and win this game because City is one of those teams that will pass the shit of you the whole game and even when you do get the ball their defense is super solid so it’d be a real pain if they had the lead going into the next game.Regardless of that I am confident in our  team winning this.ALLEZ PARIS !!,gw5v7kz,mzw6fk,psg,2021-04-28 20:04:45,asvpmamba,1

"Man city's defense looks slow compared to the Bayern back line.

KDB doe, their midfield looks set, Gueye is gonna have to put up another shift.

EDIT: watching their game.

EDIT2: they're bringing 5 every attack on the box, on the offensive they keep 3 at the back, haven't paid enough attention to notice where they overload. They press the ball when they lose it, but like I said a couple of days ago not with the same level of aggression as Bayern does.

EDIT3: every time I see Lucas Moura I can't forget how shook he was against farca during the Aytekin robbery they pulled on us

EDIT4: these 2 teams are flawed in their attack in having no 9, when Harry Kane comes back out to pick and carry the ball he leaves a hole no spur can cover making it easy on city's defense. also the spurs got Laporte a yellow and now refuse to keep atacking his side....

"I was thinking about the next seasons with the new formula of UCL and the fact that we will have to play more games. 

I wanted to ask you guys, how would you feel if big clubs decided to play their U21 on national cups.

Don’t get me wrong, I love cups and I know Paris has a special history with cups, but with the augmentation of games, it’s too much for the health of players and we need to give them some rest.

It would give time to the titis the same way you traditionally play the second GK on cup games. We could really develop our youth team like this.

It would also even the completion and allow smaller clubs to win it. Cuz let’s face it, we don’t need the 2 millions or whatever the prize money is, but that would help a lot of clubs. 

I would like if that became a sort of tradition amongst top clubs that play European football aswell.

"Let's keep in mind, the biggest attraction of the esl is not the league itself, but no RELEGATION.
If the esl was like it was but without the founders clause, I guarantee you no one will join.

Why? Manchester united, spurs, arsenal, and barca would probably get immediately kicked out and usurped by smaller well-managed teams, who would then be the new big clubs due to esl revenue split.

 As of now, man u can barely make top 4 despite being the 2-3rd largest club in the world and with a huge financial advantage. People seem to not know that they have had higher net spending than psg since qatar took over. 

The real reason esl started is that teams like liverpool, arsenal, man u and spurs cannot guarantee cl despite having a huge domestic market and they are afraid of losing their brand value from poor performances. 

Spanish and Italian teams are joining because they are in financial distress from all the debt they took on in the past decade. 

As successful as perez has been for real madrid, people tend to forget or overlook the main reason for his success is massive spending through borrowing or subsidized in some way by the spanish government.

It goes to show how the major European clubs have their own mafia-esque network and have impressive PR and legal teams. PR teams initiate leaks to judge public reception and legal teams have perfected this format since it was proposed in way back by Perez. Ultimately the 5 team qualification and continuation of domestic football normally means that all this will have zero *legal* ramifications.

This is Perez's brainchild, he knows what he's doing and he has made his first important move. All UEFA can do is employ some scare tactics but sadly the moment the sponsors decide to look the other way, champions league football will be doomed.

It is not as though psg has a healthy lead so why not pick best team available?

At home against such modest opponents why do you have Danilo and Herrera in the same lineup?

For the 1st goal conceded where was kehrer as Kimpembe had to dash to cover his man but all in vain.

I will continue to say it until I'm blue Rico is useless.

Better to have a hot prospect learn under Navas than have this tool.

Again if Navas can play in cl he can play in the league.

Not sure why Verratti did not start cos if Florenzi can so can he.

Mbappe saved the team yet again. 

This sub is full of those that love and hate.

The hatred of icardi is both baffling and ignorant. 

He is the only proper 9 in the squad. 

The biggest reason why psg has this appalling home record especially against those that park the bus is his absence. 

People are looking for a number 9 to be doing stuff outside the box not me.

Not many pure goal scorers like icardi and for me he is pure gold.

Watched city vs Chelsea yesterday in which Jesus was absolutely useless. 

Always doing things that have nothing to do with a 9.

People on here love kean even if he is not a pure 9, has a horrible 1st touch, no skills just hustle. 

He is excellent as an attacking right wing forward but he is too crude in his committing of fouls.

Rafinha did not play well but I'd have preferred if he started with Verratti not instead of.

Why was Neymar not playing I thought he collected 2 yellow cards against Lille and not a straight red.

2 yellows = 1 match suspension which he served vs strasbourg unless they added more due to something I'm not aware of.",guyvmh1,mtcbn3,psg,2021-04-18 21:54:15,denco2019,0

"First of all I wanted to say that I like this Subreddit a lot because we can talk about our club however I noticed a few people who insult others (saying that they would not be real supporters lol) who have  different ideas and opinions on the performance of the collective and individualities.
 In short concerning the performance of the team, we failed in the game plan put in place by pochettino who undoubtedly wanted to help the side by blocking the wings but in vain on the other hand even if tactically he was in.  failure, he was strong mentally and the LDC is the mind above all.
 We were able to count on the hearts of the players who all ran for the collective with clean balls that allowed us to score three goals on five shots.
 Navas is still so monstrous and they are starting to seriously knock on the door of the Ballon D’or.
 The first half was much more balanced than the second where unfortunately we had an experimental defense. This second period is also marked by the ball that we no longer see but also a technical waste.
 In short, the most important thing is that it has been 52 years since Bayern lost to a French team (behind team: ASSE) in direct elimination and the first away win in PSG history.

Danilo, apart from Choupos header, did formidable.

Neymar, whilst not matchfit, yet again decisive on the biggest stage. For me, the best player in the world. 

Mbappe - what a finish! Such a threat, the young prodigy. 

3 away goals and a victory against the best team in the world. Forget about how superior they were; PSGs midfield was simply not good enough to maintain possession and play out from the back - we knew this. Let them keep the ball and create chances - we will counter them.

Navas is MOTM after how many times he saved their shots but our attackers worked well too. Mbappe's two goals and Neymar's magic is what we need. The way he fooled their defense with his first assist and freed Mbappe, and that second cross to Marquinhos. The first half was basically Brazilians vs Bayern lol.

I was feeling bad for Dagba as Flick loaded him with Coman and Davies but the kid survived and hung in there. So happy for him. Bakker continues to be a liability, he isn't at the level to play ucl but we were short on players. Gueye had a good game. Neymar was brilliant - no diving, no showboating and stuck to the plan. There are very few players like him when he is in his groove. Mbappe did his thing and the 3rd goal was superb  kudos to him 👏

"Excellent game. Our boys left it all on the pitch just as expected. Not gonna cap and say that I was optimistic about this game, but some of the rhetoric on this sub is extremely dramatic. The fact of the matter is we have a world-class keeper, a world-class midfielder (in verratti), and 2 world-class attackers....anyone is going to have a tough time beating us when we go balls to the wall. A few things that I think contributed to the W today:

1.)  **Everyone showed up:** Finally everyone was on the same page. It's a shame that it takes playing the best team in Europe to elicit that response but hey...we'll work on that later. We played team offense, with our wingbacks providing width when needed but staying goalside of their marker (for the most part). We played team defense with Neymar, Mbappe, DiMa, and Drax pressuring Bayern's backline to make them mess up passes to their midfield. Lastly, we held it down in defense during Bayern's 1000-cross barrage.

2.) **Poch/PSG's** **Tactics:** We sat back and let Bayern play their game, but stayed loyal to ours. More importantly, we took advantage of our opportunities when we had them on offense while maintaining shape on defense. Mbappe made streaking runs across a pretty immobile defense all night long. Bayern's high-press helped them and hurt them. They were able to fluster our midfield and keep it in our half, but Mbappe's pace and Neymar's decision-making were too lethal on the counter-attack and it kind of nullified the offensive opportunities Bayern was getting.

3.) **We didn't start Kehrer:** Didn't even sub the man in....**love it.**",gtqj29j,mmbswq,psg,2021-04-08 05:30:49,JustinG4,8

"Entire defense was okay, Diallo sucks at tackling the ball back but whatever. Bakker is not a first league level player. Navas is a god.



Neymar is one of the best of all time it’s almost normal to us he creates so many chances we wouldn’t have a single goal today without him, and honestly he should’ve gotten a penalty too.



Mbappé scored but his first finish was horrible he shot straight at Neuer’s body just like in the final. He also did zero pressing which lead to Bayern building up in peace which gave them way too many chances. He really shouldn’t start next game and for those who don’t believe me go watch the game back and see how many Bayern chances could’ve been prevented if Mbappé showed as much effort as the 21 other players. Also the guy makes weird jittery runs on the offside line instead of natural runs like I’ve seen players like Robben Ribery Henry RvP do for 20 years or something.


Draxler and Di Maria kinda useless most of the time both offensively and defensively, didn’t really neglect their tasks though.


I’m happy, and I’ve been saying we’d win for weeks but realistically Bayern should’ve scored like 5+ times.


Gueye was immense too. Herrera was good. Dagba thank you for existing and not making Coman look like Messi’s son fuck Kehrer.


Idk if I sound too negative but 24 shots from Bayern goddamn that’s extreme lol.

"First, 3 away goals and a win is incredible. Our players pushed through to make it happen!

But omg that was stressful as hell. Our defense managed to hold it together right until the end. But we were barely able to withstand Munich's constant pressure. Our open play was terrible, mainly because of the high press against us. Every time the ball was passed back into our half, it was never easy. There was hardly any time for our players to calm down and be comfortable with the ball. Yes, there were moments of brilliance and our counter-attacks were threatening, but that was an exhausting game for the players. If we hadn't scored those goals, we would have been utterly destroyed.

"It's not over guys, this was just the first leg, we have to get it done again at home. Bayern just showed us they can lay it on thick for the entire 90 minutes. We conceded two goals in that time and we know it's going to be difficult to prevent them scoring on our home soil. 

Our biggest concerns is Marquinhos...the extent of his injury is a big problem for us right now. We have shown we can still play without him, but it's going to be incredibly nervy for us going forward.

The biggest positives is that I think we played well enough and we were disciplined enough to not sustain too many yellow cards and that we absorbed as much pressure as we could. It's quite incredible the lifelines that Navas have given us, because on his worst day the scoreline would be completely different.",gtqh9rn,mmbswq,psg,2021-04-08 05:17:03,sav86,14

"Great game and it's such a douche move that 1 of these 2 sides will not be in the semis.

This tie is far from over and such a pity about all the injuries and covid.

Special mention to guys that usually get stick on here from me included but they stood up tonight.

Dagba is substandard but he tried his best and acquitted himself very well.

My biggest problem with gueye is that like Emre Can he thinks he is good on the ball but when he plays to his strengths like he did tonight then he is useful.

Danilo played well in defence.

Draxler put in a very good shift.

I have never had any time for anyone that talks about selling Mbappe as no matter how it is explained I can never understand the logic behind such thinking. 

More than any other player psg winning the cl depends on him.

He is not as talented as Neymar (when on form no one is imo) but he is more reliable (fitness wise and attendance) and he is more cold blooded.

Personally I think anyone that mentions he should be sold needs to be banned.

Whatever it is that he wants please give it to him within reason of course. 

He is only 22 and an absolute monster of a player that against the better sides in cl that wants to play football and not park the bus, is almost unplayable. 

Pochettino did lots of things right but his best decision was to give 0 minutes to Kehrer. Absolute genius. 

The 2nd leg though should be feared as psg has not beaten anyone of note under Pochettino at home.

90 minutes without Marquinhos will be painful.

They Absolutely cannot afford to play like they did against Barcelona .

Di Maria needs to step up as he was average tonight. I'd be tempted to start with kean on the left.

Not sure I want Paredes to start. Verratti will be nice though unlikely. 

Neymar needs to play against strasbourg to get his match fitness up.

Whatever happens it will be a crying shame that 1 of these 2 sides will go out.

Oh yeah chuppo moting scoring was such a bummer but his other misses made up for that.

Amazing the 4 quarter finalists on this side of the draw regardless of both results tonight and yesterday all have a great chance of qualifying. 

All 4 sides can score goals anywhere. They will all be confident of qualifying and rightfully so.

A lot will depend on if Goretzka will be fit as boy he is difficult to contain.

Hopefully sane will be as hopeless as he has been tonight and most season if I'm being honest. 

No matter who is unfit though please Pochettino do not be tempted to play Kehrer. 

Chelsea have qualified as I don't see Porto scoring 3 and Liverpool beating Real Madrid at home with the season they have had at home is extremely unlikely.",gtqtrlw,mmbswq,psg,2021-04-08 06:57:02,denco2019,3

Bad performers include Angel Di Maria, and Thilo Kehrer. Kehrer got beat so many times, it was necessary to sub him out. 

Boneheaded move by Neymar to get himself sent off in the last minutes of the match. He needs to calm down, he’s very hot headed, but I can understand why he’s like that. Being very competitive does that to you.

"My two-cents on Paris Saint Germain (PSG) vs. Lillie: 

International break is over! In France, Lille edged past a lack-luster PSG in the Parc des Prince by a goal to zero. Here’s my opinion on the clash between first and second in Ligue I: 

Bravo to Lille for performing well after the international break. They did well to control the tempo of the game. They minimized the shots on target that PSG had, and they dealt with the shots that PSG did get in. The goalkeeper and defense controlled the threat of the electric Mbappe well, not allowing the youngster to have too much creativity with the ball. 

Thumbs down for PSG. They had much possession throughout the game (65% to Lille’s 35%). Pochetino, do something with that possession! Everything was decent.The passes and crosses found PSG players, who were open in the box. However, PSG’s shots, which were quite powerful, had no real accuracy. Neymar was extremely disappointing in the attack today. I wouldn’t even expect that childish behavior from a 13-year-old kid playing in the little leagues. Nevertheless, a 30-year-old, experienced, professional like Neymar, playing a key Ligue I match. All in all, PSG performed decently, but the goals just weren’t coming for them today. And that’s something I don’t say regularly. 

As for the men in the defense: BLAH! PSG needs to improve its defensive shape once they lose the ball. Lillie had so much space to exploit in counter-attack, with PSG’s high defensive line. The goal was outrageous coming from a PSG perspective. If PSG pressed more, the initial pass that led to the goal would not have happened. Also, why was Kehrer trying to contain David? I understand caution in the penalty area. However, when a player has that much time and space in the box, they are obviously going to shoot. David and Lille did get some Lady Luck with the deflection, but it was still a poor defensive error from PSG. 

Overall, Lille had much more discipline and control of the game than PSG, despite Djalo’s  red card in stoppage time. Marvelous matchday for Lille as they go top of the table with 66 points, 3 points ahead of runners-up PSG. As for PSG, they better hope this was just a chink in their quite shiny armor. If PSG’s form continues, Ligue I won’t be the only thing at stake...

PSG will look to win against the German giants Bayern Munich in the first-leg, quarter final clash of the Champions League. Lille will focus on keeping the winning streak away at Metz.

Paredes and DiMa very underwhelming, so was Kean. Gueye is a Savage and always seems in danger of being sent off before Half time when he plays.

"so I've been reading unusual media sources lately (mainly Argentinean due to the amount of Argentineans in the team) and their rumors are in line with what we get from the usual sources.

the idea behind selling Icardi has to do with remaining flexible to extend Neymar and Kylian. I understand what both players mean to the club but what I can't understand is how are we ever going to have a balanced midfield with someone other than Verratti....

I mean at some point you need common sense to dictate your recruitment towards a balanced squad.. we basically already have only 1 decent midfielder in Verratti if we only stick to Kean we'll basically end up with Kylian who refuses to understand he's not a 9 or a LW and Kean who is seriously very rough around the edges..... and I haven't even said a word about our full backs situation.....

"Probably untrue, but it would be great.  


Icardi is too much of a poacher type striker, when we need one who, similarly to Benzema, can combine with Neymar and Mbappé, set-up plays and be lethal.  
Also, Icardi never really gives that impression of being fully-invested, his social media posts certainly don't contribute to giving him a good image, he is injury prone and his physical form is questionnable. I'm thinking he is maybe a bit too distracted in a city like Paris.  


Kean on the other hand gives everything on the pitch, is young and promising, and brings in much needed physicality, in a team of players who aren't very physical (except for Danilo and Kimpembe).

Ideally, Icardi's transfer would open up room to secure Mbappé and/or Neymar's extension, as well as Kean's transfer. It's a shame because Icardi is one hell of a striker but it doesn't look like he is a good fit here.",gt4l13t,mifygx,psg,2021-04-02 18:04:35,HaaamGirl,20

* Mitchell Bakker on loan 

* Thilo Kehrer for to BL team for €10m 

* Fadiga for €4M   % of re-sale.

* Sergio Ramos free transfer

* Moise Kean if Everton settle for €30m

Total expenses: €70M to €105M.

We will not be signing a left back, when Bernat comes back he’ll be undisputed starter with Diallo/Kurzawa as backups, and Bakker will go on loan in hopes of replacing kurzawa in the future 

It’s Nordi Mukiele that will solve the RB situation, Pereira has regressed due to the acl so he’s now overvalued 

We can only afford 1 world class midfield signing, that will have to push someone out the other way

At least someone understands Herrera’s influence

Ricardo Pereira didn't he suffer a serious injury already? I like Caqueret more than Aouar.

how good is Ait Nouri defending?

Depay ia not the striker we need. he doesn't defend....

EDIT: huge edit below

sell:

* Kehrer
* Paredes
* Kurzawa
* Herrera
* Diallo
* Gueye
* Icardi, not because he's bad I just get the feeling he doesn't want to be here
* Danilo, if we can get Brozovic
* GKs, keep 3, only 3
* Fadiga, sell with buy back option
* Kalimuendo, sell with buy back option
* Dina Ebimbe, sell with buy back option

our club needs to figure out a strategy to develop the titis.. loans, buy back options, something is better than nothing.

"I’d get rid of :

Sarabia- if sevilla’s interested in him, let them get him back for 10-15 mil. We paid 18mil so its not a big loss

Herrera - whatever

Paredes - we’ll surely get at least 35m out of him , i’d keep him only in case we get rid of all the others. He’s average, but i love the way he plays. Gives 100% of him every match, but his abilities surely have limits.

Rafinha - whatever, he can even go for free

Kurzawa - no one would actually pay for him, so lets fucking give him for free. Any team who’d get him would do us a favor😂

Bakker- no need to sell him, a loan would be fine knowing that he’s still 20 years old, i’d be willing to give him another chance. A 2 year loan would be nice. Send him in Holland.


Kehrer- 10-15 mil is a nice price.

And i’d go for :

Aouar- 30-35 mil max, his inconsistency/injuries this season kinda did us a favor. He’s still class tho’. 

Camavinga - dont care if we overpay or not, we need him and we all like him. 55-60 is an okay price. We have to understand Rennes. They’re pretty much doing the same thing we’re doing w Mbappe. Hopefully Kiki will extend


Angelino- Bernat’s not reliable, Angelino is a beast when it comes to attacking. 

No right back - Dagba and Pembele are more than enough, another right back would make us send pembele on loan. And Pembele will be one of the best in the world.

Depay for free or Antony/Neres - Depay’s really close to barca so i doubt we got any chance on getting him but Neres and Antony are young and good. We need to start thinking about Di Maria’s replacement. Antony can become a starter in a year or two. Neres’s more of a left wing but he can do the right wing too.

For Icardi/Kean/Gueye i’m 50/50 . A better midfield would help our forwards a lot and we’d see more stuff from Icardi. But if any team’s willing to pay 45m for him we need to let him go and get a big name. Kean’s not enough. Making Kalimuendo our second choice would be a better idea. And Xavi needs to play, thats why i want all of our midfielders we got right now to go!",gzeis3p,nkrirp,psg,2021-05-25 23:45:22,KFlow99,-1
"**The conditions for a tough tug of war are being set up between the French international, Rennes and PSG.**

It's not just a question of the player's future, it's also a question of the player's future,"" he said. ""If he doesn't extend, we'll have to consider a departure."" It's the way Stade Rennais president Nicolas Holveck spoke about the Camavinga case at a press conference on Monday. ""But there are no deadlines, that doesn't exist in football. But there is no deadline, that doesn't exist in football. And the best thing for everyone would be for him to stay. I am a perpetual optimist. We have to find the best solution for him and for Stade Rennais. Playing in Europe, now that it's a done deal, can change a lot of things. If Eduardo can do one more season at Stade Rennais, we won't miss out.

It's a pious hope, because according to our information, the midfielder's advisors have told the Stade Rennais management that he will not extend his stay in Brittany. The player is at the end of his contract in June 2022. For several months, discussions had been taking place between the club and the player, but the salary demands of the French football hopeful, and in particular his request for a signing bonus, were deemed ""exorbitant"" by the Breton club's management.

### Camavinga wants to go to PSG!

The midfielder's entourage already has an idea in mind for the future of Edouardo Camavinga. According to several sources, the player wants to stay in France in order to continue his progression and he believes that his evolution goes through one club, Paris Saint Germain. The midfielder wants to join the capital club this summer. And the interest of PSG is reciprocal. According to our information, Camavinga is one of the priorities of PSG this summer. The file is managed by the Parisian president Nasser Al Khelaifi. The Parisian president has contacted the president of Stade Rennais to officially inform him of the interest of the Parisian club this summer. For the moment, no offer has been made by Mauricio Pochettino's club.

### Rennes demand €100m for midfielder

But talks between PSG and Stade Rennais are likely to be complicated. The Breton club have informed the player's entourage that the club is demanding €100 million this summer for Camavinga's departure. It is a sum that Rennes consider normal for one of the greatest hopes of world football, but which still sets the bar quite high: only Eden Hazard had left a club with a single year's contract for a nine-figure sum. And that was before the economic and health crisis of Covid.

It's not like they're going to negotiate much about the price of their midfielder. The club's owner, François Pinault, the world's 27th richest man, is following the case very closely and according to several reports is even adamant about the amount asked. Especially in view of the interest of the big English clubs for the Breton hopeful.

The summer of Edouardo Camavinga looks very hot.

"I like his tough upbringing, his judo (judoka know how to get on the ground, and get up quickly and effectively) background, his grit and skill in breaking up play.  I don't like his current overvaluation, nor his lack of use of that right foot.  He still has development to do, and could do it with a teaching coach/manager, but I'm not sure we're the club right now for that.  I DO think he's gone as far as he will go, development-wise, with Rennes.  I'd love to see him freeing up Verratti (when he's fully healthy, another reason to sider Camavinga) and Paredes to distribute while being active box to box in either breaking up play in front of CBs or supporting keeping the ball in the opponent's half.  But if he thinks he's the finished article, that would be a mistake.  If he's prepared to work even harder to be all he can be, he could be a LEGEND at PSG.

"Born and raised in Grenoble, spent a bit of time in Lyon and also spent a lot of time in Bangkok, Thailand. My mother is from France and my dad is Thai. I have since immigrated to United States and just been in love with French football since forever, never changed. I was for a long time a OL fan, but have sort of fallen out of love with them and when Zlatan came to PSG I started following Paris a lot more, at this point in time I'm comfortably a dedicated and albeit damaged PSG fan, roll with the punches, but I do pull for Lyon when it comes to the European competitions and just any French club in general.

"My own recap of yesterday:   

-  Florenzi: unfair to blame him for the 1st goal, he defended correctly (not perfectly) by pushing Laborde on the side and closing the angles, not getting too close to let him take the inside, it was Laborde exceptional speed of execution and perfect strike that made it possible. I'm pretty sure the xG of a shot like that is &lt;0.05. But still Florenzi had a lot of room to deliver excellent crosses, only one was good, the others were subpar (but gave us corners). Gassed, or suffering from post-Covid, but he's definitely way below the level he started with us and the level we need a RB to be.     
- Kean, Di Maria, Neymar : weak, slow and subpar    
- Rafinha : good technically but slow and weak    
- Paredes : average, I guess we could award him a good point for not doing anything reckless given the fact that it's always a shitshow with Montpellier      
- Gueye : very good, he's the Gueye of the 3-0 against RM. I think we should definitely keep him, he's our Kanté.     
- Bakker : good to see him accelerate, dribble and combine on the left, his crosses are still subpar, showed clear and constant progress over the season especially since Poch's arrival. At this point he's better imo than Kurz. But that doesn't mean much. This horrible season for us was a good one for Bakker's career. I don't know if we'll keep him, but we could easily sell him (I think his agent is Raiola).     
- Icardi : bottled many chances but one shot was very good and saved by a defender on the line. The first time in ages he wasn't invisible at all, he moved a lot, opened spaces, tried to combine, delivered an xA of 0.8 to Sarabia. Clear progress from the lows he hit, but still a lot of room to progress on his positioning (why is he never near the first post?is he hiding?) and finishing. My opinion is that he's still not versatile enough for us and more importantly he seems to be mentally broken/depressed/unhappy. He didn't recover from the falling from grace he had at Inter.      
- Sarabia : Like Icardi, Florenzi and couple of others, he is a good football player who started perfectly with us, scoring no bullshit goals left and right, some of them decisive in games where our  stars (Ney, Mbappe, Cavani, Icardi) were unable to finish, his confidence is shot. Biggest letdown of the game imo. Pretty sad.     
- MBappe : stellar, a beast, very intelligent and unselfish game from him, he showed true leadership. I'm being paranoid here : yesterday's game was a demonstration by Mbappé&amp;Poch to show the yuuuuuuge gap between Kylian &amp; the rest of the team and push his legitimate demands of serious recruitments and a solid sporting project if we want to renew him. I'm ofc 100% behind this, Mbappe had long periods of lows but he showed that he has the mental strenght of a top winner, we absolutely need him.     
- Pochettino : I think he setup correctly the team prematch, good thing he benched Neymar (even if it's a PR ploy), but the way he handles the match inplay is completely shambolic. It gives me vibes of hectic PL games, yes physicality, intensity, mental fortitude are all important to win PL games, but they look more like boxing matches than games of chess. He seems totally clueless to make tactical adjustments inplay and relies just on vibes and energy and even at that he seems to ooze fearful vibes of Spurs bottling. Going forward this will be a huge liability when we face good tactitians especially in the instances when our team configuration relies on a couple of key players (like how City easily extinguished us). I hope I'm wrong and that next season will show us a more assertive and tactically confident Mauricio.",gxyljz4,nbal2n,psg,2021-05-13 17:59:40,deepfrench,7

The last games were just heartbreaking with late equalizers and somehow don’t feel like PSG felt like. Somehow I think: let’s cross this season out and hope for a newstart as the team we know after a real training phase in the summer as they didn’t have it last year. Maybe some of the players that don’t perform well will go and hope for a good signing too.,gxyayhk,nbal2n,psg,2021-05-13 15:13:04,ClabusterBerry,7

"Haha good thing we won, score should have been 4-1 by the 75' and against ten players.      
Mbappé on his own planet.    
Despite the shocking absence of conversion, I think we played collectively pretty good, outside of our cheat code, Bakker and Icardi were better than usual, Gueye good, Florenzi and Sarabia much worse than usual (ouch!!!) and Pochettino's coaching seemed totally random lol.      
     
And also, fuck Der Zakarian;",gxwiz0h,nazeyd,psg,2021-05-13 05:19:06,deepfrench,9
"I know people here are still raging about particular players playing bad. It's definitely true. 

But my feeling seems to be, it is a coaching fault. A coach's first job is to strengthen the defense of a team. 

It was clear as day with the Chelsea team. Under lampard they were leaking in goals every match. Players were out of position, defenders making mistakes. Every fan wanted better players. 

But as soon as Tuchel came in, within one day the same defenders totally changed and Chelsea became the best defense in EPL. 

It's a coach's job to play a system depending on the players they have and to set up the team so the final line of defense does not get so much exposed. 

Every time I see PSG with any opposition, I see the opponents running in through PSg defense and numerous 1v1 situations being created. 

In 1v1 situation anything can happen. And then we criticize the players. 

It is a coach's job to setup the team such that 1v1 situations rarely happen. 

The way any team in France can expose and cut open our defenses is a joke. 

I am betting you guys, we can have the best defenders in the world, yet we will be exposed time and again unless our coach puts up a tighter system.",gxx6ju5,nazeyd,psg,2021-05-13 08:22:47,bill220,3
We desperately need full backs. Both Montpellier goals could have been avoided with a better right back than florenzi. Bakker was actually decent for once which made florenzi’s defensive struggles even more clear,gxwhpyp,nazeyd,psg,2021-05-13 05:10:12,UCLAlex,10
"Honestly, I'd completely understand if Mbappe decides to leave. He has been carrying us for a while now while the rest of the team are dead weights. Both Mbappe and Icardi unselfishly give the ball to Sarabia who wastes it. The second goal is because the ""back passer"" Bakker lost track of his man while Florenzi is just awful...  Also Icardi, the supposed poacher couldn't score from 2 sitters...

We can barely win the Ligue with some of these average players, let alone the UCL.",gxwh9zq,nazeyd,psg,2021-05-13 05:06:59,AskewScissors,7

Theo Hernandez: LB, young, he’s very good attacking but a little leaker defensively but that can be improved upon.

Kean: Works hard with the ball, young and promising.

Sancho(If Mbappe leaves):. Young and is already world class.  Can play RW and LW.

"Placing this here in case the post drops too much. Our game against city, exposes what Tuchel wanted to address last summer: Our midfield has technical quality, but doesn't use it to create danger in the final third or scoring chances for ourselves. 

It's kind of impressive how our wingers/central forwards are the ones who create danger and score, but that does beg the question : what do our midfielders not named Gueye and Danilo actually do in the pitch? 

(I also put Verratti in there because he's kind of an Iniesta that doesn't necessarily goes up with the ball to create the assist in the final third.) 

This is the main reason why I want the club to sell Paredes. He's good when he's in top form and technically sound, but he doesn't create danger in the final third and isn't that much of an offensive threat that the opposition has to really be careful about the game plan of isolating Neymar and Mbappé. 

Ultimately we need to get better at deciding what players we should go after. Rather than looking at price tag or reputation (or even position) , we would do better business if we'd actually recruit players based on specific traits we want. 

 Unfortunately for us, this is close to the Liverpool / Dortmund style of extensive data driven scouting that Leonardo seems to dislike (he did fire a bunch of people in charge of data within our recruitment cell if I recall correctly).",gxlmbnr,n8y62m,psg,2021-05-10 20:25:33,Belfura,12

How can you lose 2 league titles in the last 5 years to teams with 1/10th your budget? The team is a disgrace, I have never been more disappointed as a PSG fan in my entire life as I have been this season. At least there were 0 expectations back in the 90s or 2000s.

other fans may think differently and that's fine, but the league is what I always want us to win and the players should have the respect to give it their all in the league no rash tackles when things don't go your way, no checking out because you're out of the CL, but always wanting to win the league.

"I will say something what i think and probably got downvotes and comments like “you are not psg supporter”, so lets go.
First of all i am happy with his contract signing , and was happy when he came in PSG and will always be happy to have Neymar in team. But i dont like him when he got the ball in feet and keep it that way for 7-8 seconds trying joga bonito instead of fast build up or fast passing, everytime he got the ball he will keep it minimum 5-6 seconds. I dont like when other players are open and they decide to pass it to Neymar instead open player just beacuse he is Neymar. What happened against city when he didnt pass to Icardi or Di Maria when they were going 3v2 that was his ego for ballon d or and that needs to stop happening, i remember that excatly situation 2018 vs Real Madrid 1st leg. He is great player and i like him but everyone needs to understand that 3 City players were marking him and he is out of play even he wants to force it going his ways but he cant. We need to buy world class midfielder because no one knows except Mbappe to play Neymars way and nobody cant follow Neymars play. That needs to be changed ASAP. Now we keep Mbappe and buy world class midfielder, without that we cant compete for Champions league based on what will Neymar and Mbappe do in game.

I’m grateful that Ney brought new fans to psg etc etc... but like Mbappe I feel they are too powerful inside our club’s hierarchy and a club can’t function that way.

When I Hear that Neymar and Mbappe are asking for better players during the transfer window that makes me sick.

First, That’s disrespectful for their teammates, and second, a good player makes his teammates better. He helps them, inspires them, raises their level, drives the team, instead of yelling at a the 3rd LB that he isn’t good enough.",gxez6pk,n7obqd,psg,2021-05-09 02:59:43,HugoChinaski,2

"According to transfermark (I know) :

Fabiàn Ruiz: 44 M

Kessie: 50 M

Theo Hernandez: 50 M 

Emerson Royal: free.


We need to secure Emerson, even if his football  IQ ain’t that good, he is prime cafu compared to dagba and Florenzi.  And he is young, fast and has potential. And he is free we can still buy someone else.

Leonardo should try to persuade Camavinga to run down his contract and sign him next January.


The other players prices can be negociated, especially if their club doesn’t qualify for UCL, and they are going to need money with covid and all.

Only with those changes, we adress the majority of our problems, improve the quality of the team, and vastly improve the physicality of the team.

Unlike our current midfield and right fullback, these players are used to play with a lot of intensity.

Icardi can be included in one of those moves.

Paredes too (if we really decide to change the style of the team, if not we should keep him).

There was a VertiMax machine, with elasticated bands attached to a plate, players running out and coming back. There was a Keiser power rack, which Pochettino’s staff would push back down just as the players were squatting it back up. “We used to do weight training, running, and it was really difficult,” Lambert says. “They loved Luke Shaw because he was 17 at the time and he broke all sorts of records. Poch created an environment where lads would be in competition with each other, trying to get fitter and stronger.”

“The first few times I remember thinking, ‘What the hell is going on here?’,” Fox says. “I remember lads going outside to be sick. But it was all part of Mauricio’s plan to get everyone as fit as possible.”

But there is more to Pochettino’s training than just double sessions and power. He also likes doing cognitive training with the players, covering walls with electric lights that players have to reach, to test their reaction times.

And not all of the double sessions are decided by Pochettino himself. At Tottenham, the group of attacking players (usually Kane, Son, Dele and Eriksen) would organise a second double session during clear weeks, as well as the power session everyone did. The strikers, led by Kane, would spend 45 minutes working with three academy goalkeepers (never the professionals), practising different attacking movements and patterns and finishes. They would go back through old clips of their recent attacking performances, rival strikers, rival goalkeepers, seeing which keepers come off their line and which stay on it, testing out which finish might work under different conditions. Anything to get an edge.

“I’m not going to lie, I didn’t like him at first because he pushed me to my limit,” Lambert says. “He did actually break me at one point. It wasn’t nice at the time but once you accept it, and go along with him, that’s when you see the true benefits. Physically and mentally, he pushes your game to a whole new level.”

In the summer of 2013, Pochettino wanted to find a way to take his Southampton team to the next level. So he called his old friend Xesco Espar, the former coach of the FC Barcelona handball team. When Pochettino had started coaching at Espanyol he had read Espar’s book, Jugar con el corazon (“Play from your heart”), loved it, and struck up a friendship with Espar.

A few years later, Pochettino went to Espar for advice. He told his old friend that he had an incredible team at Southampton, but that they did not believe in themselves enough. They only wanted to stay in the Premier League, Pochettino wanted to expand their ambitions, to do something with their hearts and minds.

So in pre-season, Pochettino took his players to Espar’s base in Spain to try out his motivational techniques. “At first with footballers, especially from British culture, it’s a bit like you’re not going to do that,” Fox remembers. “But everyone was on board. And then he sent us outside.”

Espar had the Saints players and staff walk over hot coals, a technique he had learned from American motivational speaker Tony Robbins. The players were told to take their shoes off and focus on something that motivates them as they walked across. Danny Fox remembers walking across and shouting “No more Gacon runs!” as he completed his.

Six years later, Pochettino called Espar again. Tottenham had just qualified for the Champions League final, against Liverpool in Madrid. They had done the impossible in getting that far but now Pochettino wanted to focus on their mentality ahead of the final. He wanted to make sure the players would recognise their fears, tackle them and overcome them in the build-up to the final.

He set aside 45 minutes every morning in the build-up to the final to work on his players’ mentality, as well as bringing Espar over, 10 days before the final, to run some more sessions, to develop the players’ emotional state.

As well as walking on coals, Espar also had the players snap an arrow with their necks, to show the courage and strength required for a task like that. And Espar taught the Spurs players something he has discussed with Pochettino many times, about the four pillars that create your emotional state.

The first pillar is your posture, which creates your emotion. The second pillar is movement. The third pillar is where you focus. And the fourth pillar is your inner dialogue. With these four pillars the players could manage their emotional state.

They did exercises to show the importance of each pillar. They shook hands with one another, first with the idea that they were wasting their time, then with the idea that they were a salesman on commission, desperate to impress a customer. They were asked to recreate their celebrations on reaching the Champions League final, embodying that emotion, as difficult as that is.

Equipped with this knowledge, the players could walk over the hot coals knowing that, no matter what happened or whatever setbacks they may face, they could not change their emotional state. “It’s not that you have no pain,” Espar explains to The Athletic. “It is that the universal energy protects you when your emotional certainty is at its top level.”

If there is a final ingredient to the Pochettino management, beyond the intricate style of play, the intense training and gym work, it is this spiritual side. Pochettino is a great believer in “energia universal”. “It is a superior energy that you can connect with, if you are open, if you have opened your mind,” he explained to a few journalists in a room at Spurs’ training centre just before the 2019 Champions League final. “With some strategies, you can connect with this energy, this energy that is so powerful, that makes you feel invincible.”

All Pochettino’s life he has felt a connection with this energy, and all of his career he has felt able to read and channel and embody it. (That is why his office at Spurs contained a bowl of lemons, because they absorb negative energy.)

For Espar, this almost spiritual ability is Pochettino’s greatest strength. “One of the main traits of great leaders is you have to inspire people to be better than what they are,” Espar says of Pochettino. “Because you see the greatness in the players before they even see it. He is able to talk with the players, convey that universal energy, and make them even bigger than what they are now. This is his gift. He believes in other people, and other people, when they talk with him, believe in themselves.”",gx97xa5,n6sj3p,psg,2021-05-07 17:48:39,BAHOTVELLA,6

The same was true at Southampton, and explains why even players who lost their places and were even let go by Pochettino speak so warmly about him. “He was so encouraging to everyone in the squad,” Fox remembers. “He treated every single person the same regardless of who they were, whether that was the likes of Rickie, Adam (Lallana), Morgan (Schneiderlin), or players like myself who had only played a few games, or were on the bench a lot. We were all treated the same.”

“The toughest job is keeping everyone happy, especially when you’ve got a lot of good players like we did at Southampton. Everyone seemed to be happy whether they were in the squad or not. Everyone liked and had the respect for Mauricio and his staff. He treated us all like human beings.”

Motivation alone is not enough. Not to win games as consistently as Pochettino’s teams have done. For that, you need the other crucial aspect of his coaching: trying to improve every single player. Whether in terms of technique, fitness, psychology, every aspect of the game is there to be worked on.

Underneath all the hugs and meetings and handshakes lies a vast network of numbers, measurements and science, all to make sure that every one of his players is progressing in the right way. While some aspects of Pochettino’s methods have stayed the same since Espanyol, others have evolved with the progress of sports science.

To have a training process that pushes players to the limit but not beyond, you need a functioning monitoring regime first. So players have saliva tests every morning before breakfast, with Pochettino’s staff keen to measure their muscle damage, fatigue and hormone response. This way they can measure the players’ readiness to train and to see if any of their players are more likely to pick up an injury. Prevention of injuries is hugely important and nothing is left to chance.

This allows Pochettino and his staff to push the players as hard as they can, to get them ready to play that physically demanding, high-pressing football. Because if you are one of Pochettino’s players, you have to work exceptionally hard.

It all starts in pre-season.

Pochettino’s favourite way to get his players fit in pre-season is the Gacon test. This was invented by Georges Gacon, a French fitness coach who worked with middle-distance runners before moving into football. The test gets the players to run for 45 seconds then rest for 15 seconds, with the distance they cover increasing 6.25 metres each time from an initial 150 metres. Gacon invented the test to push players’ maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max).

Gacon worked at PSG in the late 1990s, trying to improve the players’ physical condition, where he introduced the test. When Pochettino signed for PSG in 2001, Gacon had left but his test was still a big part of how PSG trained, and it has been part of Pochettino’s approach ever since. “I am honored that he is a fan of my 45+15 test”, Gacon told The Athletic via email.

“I remember going to Austria and Spain for pre-season, it was so tough,” Fox remembers. “He had us doing Gacon runs, he would be telling us it was easy, we would run for a bit, then wait, then go again. But it seemed to keep going and going. He’d be saying it was easy, ‘Keep going!’. But, oh my god!”

But the hard work does not stop when the season starts. Rickie Lambert remembers how demanding the physical training was on Mondays, when the players used to do 12 horseshoe runs of the training pitch.

“Training was so intense after games on Mondays,” Lambert says. “I used to think, ‘What the fuck is this?’. For the fit lads it was just a jog for them, but for the big lumps like me it was a tough ask.”

So Lambert went to Pochettino to complain. “When myself and Jos (Hooivelt) went to see Poch he had a big smile on his face. Poch was nodding his head and saying ‘I understand, Rickie’. I was probably foolish to think he was listening to what I was saying. I’ve gone back to the lads to give them the good news, and I’m buzzing with myself.”

Lambert was in for a shock. “We played on Saturday, had training on Monday and instead of doing 12 horseshoe runs, we do 24. That was the point where it was like: you either go with him or you don’t. That was the moment where we decided to go with it. Not one of us said anything about it after. Poch really pushed us when he started to know us more. Initially I thought, ‘Wow, this guy is crazy’. But we all improved, and that was the fittest I had ever been in my career.”

Playing for Pochettino means having to work harder than you have ever worked before, and you do it all not only under the watchful eyes of his loyal staff, but in front of the cameras too. Pochettino likes to record every session, even in the gym, just so he knows who has been working and who has not.

You also get fewer days off than you would for other managers. For Pochettino, the point is to respect the game, the principles of elite sport and the players themselves. That respect is conveyed by trying to make all the players better, even the ones that are not in the first team. During international breaks it might be easier to give the non-selected players time off, but if you play for Pochettino you will still be working hard. Some players might not enjoy it but when Lucas Moura hit a second-half hat-trick at Ajax at the end of a tiring 2018-19 season in which he had never played for Brazil but still pushed to his limits with Tottenham, you could see that it was worth it.

At the heart of the Pochettino approach is the double session. In the middle of a week when there is not a midweek game, the players will have to train twice. After their morning session and then a three-hour rest break, the players will be back in for a second session. This session will take place in the gym, but it is not a traditional weight-lifting session. It is about functional movement, and the patterns of movements that players need in a game.

The theory is that in playing football there are four actions: running, jumping, competing for the ball and kicking (or throwing) the ball. These power sessions focus on each of those four actions, with varying resistance and repetitions, trying to build up the players’ power and endurance over time.

At Tottenham, Pochettino was able to work in a high-quality gym, thought to be the best power gym for footballers in the world. But at Southampton he had to work in a Portakabin, for what they called “Spanish Gym”.

“Wednesday was the gym day,” says Fox. “It was 11-v-11, everyone had to be at it, it was all go. The way Mauricio is on the sidelines, he wants everyone to press and win the ball back as high as possible. Then we’d go home and come back for the gym. It was something I have never done before, and I’ve never done since I left Southampton",gx97v21,n6sj3p,psg,2021-05-07 17:47:40,BAHOTVELLA,4
"P3

Pochettino’s job, and one that he relishes, is to make his players feel part of something. Those bonds of loyalty are what make the football come to life on the pitch.

In some jobs, this is easier than others. At Espanyol, Pochettino took over a struggling team, and while he arrived with the credit that comes from being a legendary player there, he still had to convince his former team-mates that they were good enough to fight their way out of the relegation zone. At Southampton, Pochettino arrived with no experience of English football but he found a team on an upward trajectory. They had earned consecutive promotions, they were pushed by the ambitious Nicola Cortese and the players believed they could achieve anything.

But Pochettino still needed to win his new players over, even across the language barrier. Danny Fox remembers one day, a couple of weeks after Pochettino arrived, being called into his office by assistant Jesus Perez, who interpreted between the two men.

“I remember Mauricio asking me to tell him everything about myself,” Fox tells The Athletic. “I reeled off a few things. He asked, ‘Why didn’t you say that you were a Premier League footballer?’. I replied that’s just not the way I am, I would never say that. He told me I am a Premier League footballer, and that I should say that. It was little things like that. I was in his office for close to two hours. This was a fella who can’t speak English, but talking through his assistant there was no awkwardness. It was just people who enjoyed talking about football.”

That meeting is very typical of Pochettino. Of course, all managers speak to their own players but Pochettino is a man who wants to share everything with his players, clearing space in his diary, often making sure he has no scheduled meetings after training, so that he can speak with whoever he wants, for as long as they need. Everything should naturally flow.

Lambert tells a similar story about getting called into Pochettino’s office to be told that he had been called up for Roy Hodgson’s England squad for the first time. “It was a lovely moment for me, my family and Poch,” Lambert says. “I could tell how much it meant to him. He called me into his office and gave me a big hug.”


Pochettino enjoyed a good relationship with his Southampton players (Photo: Getty)
At Tottenham the initial task was harder because of the mess that Pochettino inherited after the 2013-14 season, when neither Andre Villas-Boas nor Tim Sherwood could organise or motivate a disaffected squad.

In an attempt to bring the players together, Pochettino instituted handshakes at Spurs every morning before training. After he had planned the day’s activities, Pochettino would sit on a sofa in the canteen, waiting for the players to arrive for breakfast. They would shake hands with him and with each other. (When Dele Alli did not shake hands with Pochettino before a canteen meeting early on in his time at the club, he was warned not to make the same mistake again.)

That encapsulates one of the challenges of management, finding the right balance between encouraging the players to act a certain way while not forcing them to. So while Pochettino has high expectations in terms of behaviour, he does not want to enforce them.

For that reason, Pochettino has never believed in fining his players for minor disciplinary issues. In his view, the players deserve their salaries, and even then the club cannot especially hurt players by fining them when they are already so rich. The challenge of motivating the squad is to get all the players to buy into the group ethic and the manager’s philosophy because they sincerely believe in it, not because they are scared of getting punished if they do not.

While Pochettino wants a close relationship with his players, there still must be some distance. Pochettino and his staff will never go into the players’ dressing room at the training ground. They believe that space is the players’ sanctuary and the coaching staff have no business there.

Every manager in football can keep the first eleven happy. The challenge is to make sure that the whole squad is engaged in the success of the team, even the ones who are not playing. Pochettino is not very keen on being asked by players why they are not in the team, and some who have confronted him in the past about a lack of opportunities have not got much of a reply. But in Pochettino’s mind, no player has an automatic right to get in the team. As he always says, when a player signs a contract at a club, he signs to train, and to be available to play. The contract itself does not convey a right to play.

At the start of Pochettino’s first season at Spurs, Harry Kane was behind Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor in the pecking order. If Danny Welbeck had joined Spurs rather than Arsenal, Kane would have been fourth choice and might even have gone back out on loan. After a poor display away at Partizan Belgrade he did not even make the bench for a league game against West Brom. Kane was dismayed and wanted answers from Pochettino. But that was the moment when he realised he had to improve to get into the team.

One of the successes of Pochettino’s time at Spurs was forging those same bonds of loyalty even with the players who were not always in his first eleven. The key for him and his staff was to keep the other players in good condition, able to help the team and most importantly believing that they would be useful.

Every Christmas, when the games are relentless and the players are tired, Pochettino would rotate more, bringing in players who were not first choices before. And his Spurs team was consistently the best in the country over that busy Christmas period. From their four league games over Christmas, they took 10 points in 2014-15 and 2015-16, a full 12 points in 2016-17, back to 10 in 2017-18 and then nine in 2018-19.",gx97tb5,n6sj3p,psg,2021-05-07 17:46:55,BAHOTVELLA,3

Another Pochettino favourite came from November 2015, just over one year into his tenure. Spurs were 2-1 up on Aston Villa in added time. Kyle Walker won the ball, found Erik Lamela, who exchanged passes with Eric Dier, and went back to Toby Alderweireld, who returned the ball to Lloris. He played out to Ben Davies who drove forward, played a one-two with Josh Onomah, found Eriksen, who played in Lamela, who played a first-time pass to Kane, who nailed his finish. Eleven passes, 33 seconds, nine players.

In all three of these goals, and plenty of others scored in Pochettino’s 12-year managerial career, the same characteristics are there. The precise way they play out from the back, never hoofing the ball long. The way the centre-backs split and drop. The way the full-backs provide width. The way possession is used as a means to dominate, but never the end in itself. The way the attacking players adopt the correct positions to give their team-mates options approaching the final third.

The striking thing about these goals, and Pochettino’s teams at their best, is how well structured they are in possession. They are not quite as rigid as Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, but that is the closest comparison from any other style of play in the game. And the advantage of being this organised in possession is that it allows Pochettino’s teams to do the one thing they are most famous for: press.

It takes a good organisation and structure in possession to be able to win the ball back quickly. Pochettino likes to tell his players to press hard for the first three seconds after they lose the ball before retreating. And to do that effectively, they need to be in the right positions. You defend the way you attack, as Pochettino says, rather than the other way round.

This vision of the game informs everything Pochettino does on the training pitch. All of the double sessions, Gacon endurance tests, walking on hot coals and so on are geared towards getting his team to play like this. No matter which team he is coaching, he drills the players to see the game like he does, to take up the positions he demands, and to dominate the game through their positions on the pitch.

Just ask Rickie Lambert, one of the stars of Pochettino’s Saints.

“The biggest difference between Poch and all the other managers I played under was the way he looked at football”, Lambert tells The Athletic. “He sets you up in a specific position, and so much detail goes into it.

“For example, say a ball comes from a throw-in and the other team scores a goal. Poch won’t say anything about the goal, he’ll go back to the throw-in and say someone wasn’t stood in the right position, or we let someone out too easily. He’d say that’s where we need to improve. It was brilliant the way he changed my way of thinking.”

Or Jos Hooiveld, who quickly learned about the game Pochettino wanted to play. “He was really clear about his ideas,” he tells The Athletic. “He came with respect, but it was his idea and his vision. He just had to make sure everyone believed in his vision by showing them it could work. We picked it up fairly early on because he was very detailed.”

Pochettino has such belief in the positional game that he always wants his teams to play this way, no matter who they are up against. That has been true throughout his career, whatever level of players he is coaching. Southampton learned that in their second match under Pochettino.

“He set up us in all these positions so we could press the other team,” Lambert remembers. “He didn’t care who it was, whether it was home or away, we were always going to press. We played Man United and I think we went 1-0 up but they came back and won 2-1. Alex Ferguson later said that we were the best team they played at Old Trafford all season.”

Between the theory and the realisation on the pitch lies mountains of work. And what underpins all of that work is the second aspect of Pochettino’s approach to management: his relationship with his squad. Because all that tactical theory would be irrelevant if Pochettino could not convince the players to believe in him.",gx97rly,n6sj3p,psg,2021-05-07 17:46:10,BAHOTVELLA,3
"
Pochettino's Philosophy

Part 1

Additional reporting: Dan Sheldon and Roshane Thomas.
It all starts with an idea.

Marquinhos intercepts the pass, and plays back to Keylor Navas. Under pressure from Lionel Messi, Navas passes to Idrissa Gueye, who plays back to Marquinhos, who passes forward to Marco Verratti. He plays out to Layvin Kurzawa, who returns the ball to Verratti, who passes to Leandro Paredes, who finds Gueye, who passes to Moise Kean, who comes back to Marquinhos. He spreads the ball left to Kurzawa, who crosses to Verratti, who flicks it onto Kylian Mbappe, who makes it 1-1 in the Nou Camp. Thirteen passes, 38 seconds, from one end of the pitch to the other, with eight players involved.

The fundamental idea of Mauricio Pochettino’s management is the positional game. Whether he is coaching the stars of Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur, or the more humble academy graduates of Southampton or Espanyol, the idea is the same: to dominate the game by controlling the space, pursuing numerical superiority through your positions on the pitch.

Mbappe’s equaliser at the Nou Camp, the first goal of his hat-trick, was the perfect example of how Pochettino wants his teams to build up through the goalkeeper, dominate and attack.

It was a special goal but not a unique one. Remember when Spurs beat Everton 4-0 at Wembley in January 2018, and the glorious fourth that day. Hugo Lloris to Jan Vertonghen to Victor Wanyama to Ben Davies to Christian Eriksen, out on the left-wing. Eriksen back to Davies to Mousa Dembele to Vertonghen to Davinson Sanchez to Serge Aurier, forward to Harry Kane. He holds the ball up, feeds Aurier on the right, who finds Son Heung-min, who clips it forward to Dele Alli, who backheels the ball to Christian Eriksen, who sweeps the ball in. Fourteen passes, 35 seconds, from end to the other, with all 11 players involved.

That was one of Pochettino’s favourite Tottenham goals, the perfect example of the positional game in action, Spurs moving around and through Everton.",gx97ps2,n6sj3p,psg,2021-05-07 17:45:24,BAHOTVELLA,5

"Of course good fullbacks on both side would change everything for us.

But our main problem is that our group of players is old fashioned.

Look at our players we look like a 2010 team not a 2020.

Verratti is quality but he doesn’t fit this era or he needs the team to be set up for him.

Same thing for Neymar who is the best player in the word individually but needs the team to be set up for him.

Same thing for mbappe who is not really a 9 and not really a winger either and won’t defend.
 
Paredes is quality but he ain’t quality enough to make up for his lack of athleticism. Let alone the lack of athleticism of his teammates.

All these players are good, and are UCL level and more, but together they do not compensate each other’s weaknesses.
Also we need players willing to play at full intensity all the games.

Let’s say Mbappe leaves.

And we wanna build a good team than can help Neymar.

So we need possession, we need physicality, we need reliable guys on the wings. The goal is for Neymar to be up front, press the  central defenders but no tracking back on the wings.

The only way we can provide him with that is playing a back 3.

Central defense :
????? —— Marquinhos —— Kimpembe.

If we play a back 3, we need 6 CB so we can rotate.

Kimpembe can be subbed by Diallo.
Marquinhos can be subbed by Danilo, and Marquinhos can play on the right of the trio if needed. But i prefer him at the center spot.

So we need two Mobile CBs, one starter and one good sub.

Kounde is the dream but he his gonna be way too expensive. For the sub, we can try to get any of Atalanta CBs.

For the two wingers/ fullbacks

The obvious choice for the left flank is Theo Hernandez. If we have Hernandez and Bernat it will be paradise. Theo is skilled, very fast and like Bernat is football IQ is very good.

On the right... i don’t know. Hakimi is the dream but I don’t see inter selling him. Maybe get a right fast midfielder and make him play deeper like Juve does with Cuadrado.

Doku from Rennes maybe ? I really don’t know.

Emerson royal from betis seems like a good short term solution but I heard his football IQ is abysmal.


Now  the central midfield :


We need stronger guys, more powerful guys. Guys who will run and shoot the ball, but still with quality.

I think we need 6 quality mids. Like city. There’s more and more games every seasons we need more good players. And Marco, Gueye and Paredes are often unavailable.

1) Get Kessie at all coast. He has everything.
Good football IQ. Great skills and ball control, press resistant. Great offensive presence. Scores goals. Great at recovering the ball. Fast. Able to get past one or 2 players. And he is a fucking tank, he bossed Manchester midfield by himself. On average he runs more than 11,5 km per game. Which is important for us. And he is young

2) Get Fabiàn from Napoli. Another complete midfielder. Very tall, strong, fast, goot ball control great passing skills, good at shooting.
Also runs more than 11,5 km per game.
It’s the perfect time to get him, napoli needs money and he is unhappy with his contract.


3) Get Camavinga, now that he is gonna be cheap we should get him. His potential his incredible and in our team i can see him contribute.


For the attack:

If we play a front three: Ney —- ???? —— Di Maria 


If we play a duo: Ney or DI Maria —- ????

???? Needs to be fast, to be able to build up, good ball control. And be an aerial presence. 

Basically a Lukaku like.

With this kind of line up, we become a threat on the wings, we can block counters, wan can dominate the midfield and let Neymar focus on what he does best.


Of course we needs quality on the bench.
Any player on out bench should be able to start at Lyon (like Manchester city).

I really like Matheus Cunha.",gx4r874,n61crh,psg,2021-05-06 17:33:32,el_walou,7
"I am looking forward for a few things

- Kalimuendo as secondary striker to Kean 
( I like Icardi but he doesn't fit our playing style ) 

- Xavi in the Midfield as sub with regular playing time, let Verratti mentor him.  

- Dagba right back or really good right back. Don't spend money on someone average. 

- Strong Tall Midfielder ( Thiago Motta like ) 
Can anyone suggest who could be a good fit ? 

- 1 fast paced winger / attacker for subbing 
( Even for subbing on fifa ffs 😂 ) 

- possible slow and steady development of Pembele

We had to go through Barca, Bayern and City, literally the top 3 highest rated teams. We managed to beat 2 already. What else do you want?

Under Tuchel, we got incredibly lucky to even get out the fucking group. We were one non-existent penalty away to play the Europa League. Holy shit people, can you not think critically?

People call his UCL run lucky but forget we completed and were in the game against the best Bayern side(or European side) in recent years with a midfield of Herrera, paredes and marquinhos.


When he left PSG was one point off the top. When poch came in he got 2,3 chances to get back up by beating relegation fighting teams like lorient.

People here slandered him for having no tactics and only ""pass to Neymar"". Imagine calling one of the best tacticians in the game having no tactics. We ignored the fact that we had no creativity except Neymar and still don't.

He wanted Rudiger and Bruno but instead we got kurzawa extension and the SD booted him.

Kicking him out is like pool fans getting against klopp for this season. We could have atleast waited for the end.

We had a coach who wasn't definitely happy with us, and didn't like the players he got. Since Poch arrived, we have Paredes, Danilo, Gueye, Draxler, Diallo and so on who plays way better.

Meanwhile, Tuchel was always a fan of the PL, he got a team with less individual qualities, but more adapted to his gameplan. And that's actually matter, guys like Verratti, Neymar, Di Maria or Mbappé can make you win match, while at Chelsea, they don't have this, so the players should listen more the coach.

We had a coach more adapted to our players, and Chelsea had a really good coach for them.

Seriously the reaction for this sub is a little bit disgusting, against City the match was terrible, but we still arrived in semi final beating Bayern and Barcelona.

"Too many people are overreacting emotionally to the loss. A CL isn't deserved. It is earned. And you don't earn it by feeling entitled thinking you can eventually win it while every other team is making calculated moves.

In reality, these past two seasons have shown that we can compete with the best of the best. There is no such thing as ""CL champion caliber team"", you either win it or you don't. Chelsea has a very good chance of winning playing Atletico, Porto, Real Madrid to get to the finals, none of which are seen as contenders. Even City played some small german club and dortmund before us. We were close last season with a very tight finals match. And this season we competed against the toughest road possible Leipzig, Man U, Barca, Bayern, Man City.

....and we all did that in the last two seasons with Bakker and Kehrer starting. Imagine if we replaced them with top players; the difference would be huge. We are really one or two players away from back to competing/possibly exceeding our competition and people want to blow the team up and rebuild?

One bad match against City doesn't take that away. In the first game, Manchester City scored 2 goals with &lt;1 XG. Even with the eye test, they looked very ""forunate"" goals. Mahrez even said he was trying to bend his freekick around the wall and somehow just happened to go through the hole. Pep said that it was ridiculous to expect his team to make it to the finals every year when they won the first match with that freekick. He was basically saying there is a lot chance involved in football. We have to remember that we came into the 2nd game on a 2 goal deficit against a very good defensive team. No one team has a made comeback this season in the CL. Even so, we had our chances with Di Maria's attempt on open goal and Marquinhos header. People forget these aren't ligue 1 teams. In matches between high level teams, you'll only get one or two quality chances a match. There have been many semi finals with aggregate 1-0 or 2-1. Had the first game ended 1-0 in our favor or 1-1, it would have been a totally different second game.

Second, the idea that Manchester City's depth is the model team is laughable. You cannot be saying this after we just lost a tight series to them if you didn't say this before match, or  when City lost to lyon last season, Spurs the season before, and Liverpool before... People are just saying this in hindsight bias. You can't say x is the team to model after, **after they win the champion league.** Then you will always be behind them. Rather you need to anticipate which teams will be good.

This is the first time City has made it to the semi's under Pep's management. Depth is overrated for the CL and more suitable for the league. Their depth didn't make much of a difference. The starters decided the game. In CL, you need to field the best starting 11 possible. Rather, the model to emulate should be the Real Madrid squad that made **8 CL semi's in a row.** What was their winning formula? Superstars + solid players in every position + luck.

I think PSG is very close to that if Mbappe and Neymar both renew and the team can focus on improving other positions. It would not be good if Mbappe or Neymar. We would essentially have to start over again, which is not easy. As much as people have nostalgia for the first QSI-era teams, they were not that good. Balanced team and stomped ligue 1, but never could get past the quarterfinals. Why? Because Barcelona and Real madrid had well rounded teams + superstars.

Imagine if Icardi's transfer had been spent on rb and Bernat didn't injured, and ligue 1 didn't restart so early and no internationals..... But that's all in the past, we can only focus on the future. And the future is not grim even though we just lost our last game.",gx1onvm,n59r39,psg,2021-05-06 00:57:37,jamaltheripper,7

We do need some rebuild, but let's not throw out everything just because yesterday's loss was a disgrace.

"Do people not realize that reaching the semi, losing to City (the best team in the competition) after eliminating Barca and Bayern, was already a huge over achievement for this team and squad?

This is a team that is struggling to win Ligue 1! A team that can't score on Lille when they defend well. Why are so many of you surprised we couldn't score more on City?

Look at the ratings on 538 (or use another site), we are far below City, Bayern and even Barca. And it has been the case for months. We struggled to get out of (an admittedly tough) the group and we needed some crazy luck in our last two games to do so. Then we trashed Barca in one of their off nights. In the return leg, they could have scored 4 in the first half.

Bayern: we scored 3 goals on like 2 occasions lol While Bayern tried everything and we got saved by Navas or luck.

We have been a good-but-not-great team for a while now, including last year. We have moments where we are awesome (first leg Barca, first half return leg Bayern, first half City) but we aren't that good and consistent. We can create an upset against good teams with a weakness like Barca and Bayern (their defense), but we can't really hope to beat City over two legs. it would be a huge surprise if we did.

You can write stupid things like ""if only we kept Tuchel"" but you're kidding yourself. You think a team with such inferior full backs and such an empty midfield can really win the CL? Again, a team that might not even win Ligue 1? Yeah sure, we could, with a lot of luck (like Chelsea 2012). We got a very tough path to the final and made it to the semi. It's great, let's be proud of this.

The one thing we really need to improve is our mental fortitude. We can't be little baby bitches like we were yesterday. That's pathetic.",gx09lu0,n59r39,psg,2021-05-05 17:15:01,MarginOfCorrectness,16
"Now that we are out, it's time for the team to pour everything they have into winning all the remaining ligue and cup games. And once the season is over, I really hope Leonardo, Poch and the higher ups sit down and think long and hard about the future of this team.  
What made the difference in yesterday's match was squad building, squad behavior and squad ability. It was basically 11 players playing collectively as a team vs a team of individualities. 11 players who fit a system and play true to that system vs 11 players with flashes of brillance but with profiles who don't fit together. A team where the danger can come from anywhere - the midfield, the wings, the wingbacks, the forwards - vs a team whose attack pattern is predictable and where the only danger will come from Neymar, Mbappé and Di Maria. Add to that the fact that Guardiola has had many years to instill his philosophy and shape the team with the players he wants vs Poch only being here for a few months and having to make due with an unbalanced squad, multiple injuries and out of shape players.  


But despite that, we still performed honorably (except the awful shameful behavior from yesterday) and people shouldn't forget that given our terrible start to the season, COVID and players who were completely burnt out, it's really incredible that we managed to reach the semi-final, while eliminating Barca et Bayern in the process, all with a newly appointed manager.   


The end of the season comes with many question marks, the biggest of them being Neymar and Mbappé : will they sign a new contract or not ? IMO, PSG should do everything they can to make Mbappé stay and build the project around him. He proved it this season : he is our main guy and his stats this season are absolutely incredible. However much I like Neymar and seeing him play, his misses way too many games, is too selfish at times and most of all has an incredibly high salary which doesn't give us a lot of leeway to filling out the positions of our team where we are the weakest.   


It's going to be crucial to bring some structure to this team. A lot of players we have are either not a required level for such a team, not a good fit on account of their profile, or vastly overpaid compared to what they bring. Take for example Icardi : a pure poacher, slow and invisible when he doesn't get the ball, who plays in a high press team where our wingers don't provide him any service. It will never work out. Same goes for Florenzi, Kehrer, Kurzawa... the list is long. Our midfielders and wingback hardly EVER contribute in attack, the threat hardly ever comes from them. We also have a bunch of incredibly talented youngsters and a great youth academy made out of players... who hardly get any playtime in our team. No wonder they feel like going elsewhere. Before anything, it's therefore important that PSG figure out what exactly is their project for this team. Buying random players and big names to fill out positions, as it was showed yesterday, has its limits. If this team is to go any further and hope to win the big cup, it needs a concrete project,  it needs the appropriate players for it,  it needs  the team to play as a team, and it needs our main attacking threats to receive support and not to be obliged to do everything themselves.",gx07gvd,n59r39,psg,2021-05-05 16:40:32,HaaamGirl,2

- As for who we should sign I’ve been repeating it forever but we should be all over Memphis Depay. He can play false 9 and winger and participate in the build up and is good for linkup play. 

- Jose Gaya at LB: 25 years old, over 200 games with Valencia, consistent, solid defensively. Nuff said

- At RB there aren’t too many reasonable options. Probably mukiele? I know people mention Emerson but I’ve never seen him play so idk. Just no Aurier or bellerin pls. Dagba will be a good backup for the league. 

- At CB we don’t even need to recruit anyone if we just play Pembele who can also play RB

- In the midfield SMS would be great but most likely too expensive. Aouar has not been playing recently but I think the potential is still there.

"They outclassed us tactically. 4 players on neymar. Icardi didn't receive much. Cut us off. 

Why am I upset tho ? 
- Because for how well they have played , the times we conceded were due to our own errors. 
How can we consistently fuck up ? 
Di Maria, as much as I'd want it to be an ""orange"", it was so unnecessary. 

- Neymar should play lesser of a free roam role. Because then he's never released to attack. And what good is verratti if ney is doing the work ? 

- Marquinhos needs to do what Fernandinho did to Zinchenko. Scream at your team. Tell them to calm down.

Whatever hate we'll get rn is completely deserved. Gg city, wish we could've played like we did in the first half of the first leg the whole time but they deservedly got the dub. Conceding those two dumb goals in the first leg forced us to play too offensively this game which inevitably City took advantage of. Either way I'm gonna avoid soccer threads for a while and just look forward to the Euro in which France is definitely one of the biggest contenders.

"Arsenal fan here. (Same popular opinion from me as well, Thought the ref and the commentators sucked. Had to mute because of their orgasms at every little thing man City did right.)

Btw, Can I ask some questions?

1) I see skepticism over Ney and Mbappe leaving. But what about Di Maria and Veratti? How many years do they have for their contracts?

Because the few times I've seen psg, it has looked to me like it always rides the excellence of these 4 players in particular. And it feels like the team could go a larger distance if only a few spots could be even manned with average players. 

2) what are the positions that you all think needs to be upgraded instantly and potentials targets you might want?

One I could suggest is Lacazatte from my club. I think a decent striker who can fall in and provide very nice link up can be so instrumental. Neymar gets less burdened this way and Di Maria gets room to really cut in and go for goals. But another winger on the left would be needed.

I just feel like Lacazatte would be a perfect fit. He is entering his last year of contract with us. And his personality is something that would go very well with Neymar's extrovertedness but at the same time can actually function as a leader who can calm the team from imploding.",gwy7453,n4y0y3,psg,2021-05-05 05:15:46,Forsaken-Currency404,4

"Not much to say, I'm sad and depressed, having come so close last year and going through the gauntlet this season to get to here. It's an expected loss, City were just a much better team to overcome and we gave them a mountain for us to try and climb. I think it was pretty clear that we lost the game in the first leg and that it was going to be too difficult to come back.

We knew we had to be risky, we knew we were also down Mbappe and we were also without a defending midfielder from the red card in the first game...we were well and truly outmatched...and even if we did some how win, we were going to give up yellow cards and be in a worse off position for the finale. As painfully as I would like to admit, but we just didn't deserve to go through this time.

I was hoping this would have been a sweet win for us and for the anti-ESL movement...but I guess life doesn't always work out like you want it to be. I won't deny my utter frustration, not necessarily towards the players or the management, but to the whole circus of it. I think the officiating was conveniently lenient when it wanted to be at the detriment to us, but I won't say that the officiating was bad overall, mostly fair I would say.

There's always next season, but if I don't see us lopping off some of the dead weight from our past sporting director and Tuchel...I don't realistically seeing us coming back this far into the competition again for awhile. No clue if Mbappe stays, most likely it's a combo deal with Neymar and Mbappe and if either goes then I'm sure we are going to need a big signing to help push us along.",gwy6tno,n4y0y3,psg,2021-05-05 05:13:42,sav86,3

The match was decided in the first tie, where manchester got two weird (low percentage) goals. Football matches are not deterministic and there is luck involved. The two goals scored today were due to loosening defense because we were far behind and needed to score. 

Let's not pretend man city are leagues beyond our team. We dominated them the first half of last game. It only went downhill when they scored those low percentage goals. The red cards though? That was very petulant and make the team look bad.

The team is far from trash like some people suggest. There's always room for improvement, but lets not forget the team made two semi finals in a row now. Before the team couldn't even consistently get past ro16.

And let's not forget, man city lost to lyon last season did they just give up and rebuild? Fuck no! They got their shit together, improved and are back to competing.

"1. I don't want Leonardo to be in this club any longer. He fired in my opinion one of the best coaches we had in QSI era after repeatedly refusing to sign players he wanted. The only very good arrival under him was Navas, the others were average/decent at best.

2. As much as I hate to say it I have no faith in Pocchetino's plan. We were inconsistent under him, we've already lost 8 matches under him. In champions league we had some moments when we were terrible such as pretty much the whole game vs Barca in Paris. However I don't think that the board would want to terminate his contract, but I'd still rather see some like Enrique or Allegri as a head coach.

3. We need new transfers and we need them now. As for the loaned players I hope we'll keep Kean and Florenzi, as they've shown that they're good when in form, but that's about it. I wouldn't necessarily miss Danilo if we don't decide to extend his stay. I've had enough of Icardi, I hope he departs this summer, he's shown little consistency since February 2020 and he just doesn't seem to be worth the money we paid for him. I think that some other players should also end their spell in Paris, specifically Kehrer, Draxler and Kurzawa as they contribute little to the team. The possible midfield partners to Verratti in the form of Gueye, Paredes, Rafinha or Herrera might not be enough, but I think that all of them should be kept in the club. I'd gladly see a new defender signed to imorove the squad depth, maybe someone like Davison Sanchez, who has been a backup to Dier and Toby for most of this season. I'd also try to sign Coutinho, he is a genuinely talented player but is underutalised in Barcelona, but could find his form alongside Neymar. I'd also be happy to see Thuram in Paris, as we could definitely use a physical attacker, who could play on both right wing and up front. I think that we should also improve our midfield, and for that we could sign Saul, who is a talented player and seems to want to depart from Atletico, as well as de Roon, who has put some solid performances for Atalanta this season. We shoud also enhance our wing back options and for that I believe Grimaldo would be fine for a left back as Benfica won't probably play in the UCL next season so that may convince him to sign for us, and for a right back position we could sign Konate from Leipzig.",gwyi0xz,n4xf5y,psg,2021-05-05 06:35:38,darealkrkchnia,3

"I understand perfectly that Kylian Mbappé is injured. But at 75%, he is still better than most in the world. He needs to come on at the start of the second half. Sub Mbappé for Paredes or Ander Herrera, put Mbappé on the left, Neymar in the middle, and Verratti drops deep in the midfield, his natural position.

We need to attack, and have as many shots as possible. The problem is that they are absolutely suffocating on defence. Neymar and Di Maria always have 2 men on them. If Mbappé goes on, he’ll help massively take the load of on Neymar and Di Maria.

Mauricio Pochettino cannnot mess this up. He cannot do the late subs as he usually does. He has to sub early. We need goals. Desperately. We are still in this, if we avoid conceding any more goals, while scoring 2, we go to extra time.

"The thing is him missing that penalty is going to hurt a lot of French fans and his performance. This will humble him and make him think and reflect as he said on his Instagram. Criticism is needed so it will allow him to understand he cannot do everything and think he’s above everyone just because he’s won significant things or become a high profile athlete. If Mbappé wants to leave then let him, I don’t want him being rude and doing stunts that will make the club struggle. The club already has enough problems going on. But if he decides to stay I hope he learns to be humble and start being more logical. There are moments when I think he’s just trying too much. Like in the game against Bayern in the final where he had an opportunity. The same opportunity last night during extra time and as well penalty

The correct question is not ""does he want to leave?"" (which he does).

Basically, there is nowhere he can go. Hence he will stay, and leave for free next summer.

But to answer your question: I think his mind has been set a long time ago, he's just waiting for Real to be able to put the money on the table. Also there's no way in Hell that PSG will let him go for free.",h3fvosj,oa48r1,psg,2021-06-29 22:10:00,MrForndog,3

 - D: Kehrer, Bernat, Bakker, Diallo, Florenzi

- A: Choupo-Moting, Sarabia, Icardi, Kean

"Leonardo built modern PSG (without him Nasser would have bought Nasri, Ben Harfa and Taraabt).

When he came back he found a mess of team, we still didn’t replace Silva, Motta, Maxwell, Ibra and Verratti (who needs competition for his spot)… all the players he got us in the first place.


He solved the Neymar drama like a lord.
He got us Navas for 16 M (best PSG player ever).

He let Silva go, a painful decision but a good one as we need to set Kimpembe and Marquinhos as our main CB duo.  (Leonardo bought Marquinhos too).

He let Cavani go, another painful but important decision as Cavani was in a bad relationship with other players, always injured and was asking for an insane salary.

He let Meunier go, another good decision, yes Florenzi was worst but the Belgian bitch had to go.

Taking painful decision is important.
When Leonardo left no one was actually capable of taking them.


On low budget for a top club he got us Sarabia who was a good player.
Danilo who actually helped us this season. 
The only big mistake is Icardi, but at the time, PSG needed a striker and Icardi was still seen as one of the top poachers in the world. 


Now Leo bamboozled Barca with Wini, he got us the next Buffon for the next 10 years.

That’s what I love about him he is always planning for the future. He got us Verratti, Marquinhos and now Donnarumma.


Great football management people like Leonardo or Perez are not afraid of having a « bad » season to prepare the future.

No more ben Harfa, no more kherer, no more david luiz.

Also funny how we got to the UCL final as soon as Leo got back.

My only regret is Tuchel, i loved that coach, but somehow tuchel always end up fighting with management.


So now we have 2 of the best GK in the world. One of them being 2 years away from retirement the other one maybe not even in his prime yet.
That’s what being a top club is. If you complain about it….. then you deserve another 10 years of Edel/Sirigu/Trapp/Areola. 

Wini will be helpful. Like a lot. Dutch Matuidi (more skills).
Now we need hakimi, theo Hernandez, Camavinga (or another promising Mid with fresh legs) and a mobile striker to play with mbappe.

Get me Pogba and i’ll change my name to Leo.

Fuck Luis Campos.
We are not a trading team or a mid table ligue 1 team trying to make a run for the league.

And Leo is a former (good) player.


We would be nowhere without Leo.
We were a circus in 2011 before him, and actually we were a worst circus when he came back 2019.

"From a Liverpool fan, you've got yourself a truly excellent player.

- His press resistance is so good, you sometimes laugh.
- Always looking to move into positions to receive the ball.
- Consistently elite pass completion %
- Tireless runner.
- Great attitude and leadership qualities.
- Always available to play (rarely injured, tired, or suspended).
- Excellent in the air for someone who's not the tallest.
- Tactically intelligent and versatile (played a very disciplined role for us, whereas plays more offensively for the Netherlands, and Newcastle before).

Detractors (including some Liverpool fans) will say he doesn't get enough goals and assists - those people don't understand how Liverpool play, and what Klopp wants of our midfield '8s'.  

It is not a coincidence that Gini was virtually ever present in our league, and champions league winning seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

1. He's always fit (so will be available to play in pretty much every game).
2. He's very consistent (can't remember the last time he had a bad game).
3. He's very versatile (can play as an 8, a 10 or even do a good job as a CDM).
4. He's got\* a very high work rate and will put in 100% for 90+ minutes.
5. He's a really nice guy that will bring a lot of positive energy in w/e team he plays for.

Pretty much all Liverpool fans are upset that he is leaving. The Barca fans telling you that they are are happy he is not signing for them, are probably still upset about the goals he scored against them in the UCL at Anfield a few years ago.",h0s8mxc,nthxra,psg,2021-06-06 19:17:50,sanyu-,104

"I’m very angry against Leonardo but the problem is club wide. Not just Leonardo. The entire organisation of the club isn’t focused on the sportive side. Jean-Claude Blanc seems to have done really well on the economic side, the growth, the finances, the development of the youth center in Poissy. 

But the sportive side is the most important in a football club. Right now Nasser, the management of the club, the big heads who have the power to make decisions or block decisions, the entourage around the management, all of those have no organisation, no appropriate communication, no efficient decision making **sportive** (sporting?) wise. 

It’s like a group of politicians who try to make decisions on nuclear energy. They have no clue. They’re missing on amazing opportunities from the Parisian region. They’re allowing german clubs to steal the years of hard work in our academy. They’re attracting players who don’t have the qualities we need. They’re letting them get comfortable instead of focusing them on the **sportive** (sporting?) side. 

We can’t trust Leonardo to make the right decisions anymore, too many mistakes have happened. Even if we splash 150-200 million euros this summer that won’t fix the underlying problems. The sportive root of the club isn’t the priority. It’s all about marketing, advertising, selling, selling, selling. 

It’s been two managers now who can’t stand the way things are run by the management of the club. It’s not a coincidence.

We need someone who runs, has strength, is good at passing and link up play and who also knows how to create space for his fellow attackers.

"This is just so salty...we all love pogba here...and to be fair he did play in a very deep position this season for man u..and thats why he lost possession in dangerous areas time and time again not to mention the NT just has a better defense than man u period. But...if  play him at an advance postion and give him freedom to show his own flair he can bail us out in many situations which even poch wouldn't have figured out at that moment. Yes but we have to understand...if we have gini pogba verratti gueye...none of them can play as a defensive midfielder or to be more clear none of them is at their best in that position..so we cannot sacrifice gini's goal scoring threat or verratti's creativity and narrow passing ability in the final third by playing them in a deeper position and gueye got a resurrection playing CM plus he is 30 so... I would keep him for bench strength...so that leaves us with either play paredes or Danilo as our 8. I am not convinced in this last part. So if we do get pogba....either paredes or danilo has to evolve into a worldclass DM or...we gotta play with a 4-3-1-2  [bernat,ramos,marqui,hakimi--gueye/marqui (if possible), verratti, pogba--gini -- ney,kyky]",h6cwpum,oqln9k,psg,2021-07-24 20:17:26,International-Home97,-1

"Interesting mercato so far but will be rendered useless if the players are played out of positions. 

If Wijjnaldum is used other than as an attacking midfielder then it will not turn out well.

He is not a holding midfielder and he is not a playmaker. He takes far too long on the ball for him to be that.

He is however great at entering the penalty box late which none of the present midfielders does.

As for Hakimi it will be a grave error to play him as a full back as he really sucks at it but as a wing back he is world class.

If Pochettino can replicate the Walker - Rose axis he did at spurs with Hakimi and Bernat then this should be an interesting season. 

Neymar and Verratti have to steer clear of injuries as its no exaggeration to say there is no way Lille wins the league if they stayed fit.

It is bemusing that this side doesn't score more from corner kicks especially from the right as no one in world football plays better inswingers than Di Maria. 

Lastly and most importantly Pochettino has to work on the synergy of the group. 

Mbappe didn't like passing to Kean, Neymar does not pass to anyone that is not Verratti,  di Maria and especially Mbappe. 

This has to stop. If a player is free and in a good position, give him the ball.

Too many ignorant comments on how bad icardi is .How can he not lose form and confidence if his team mates especially Neymar does not give him the ball.

The irritating thing is that Neymar does not do this for Brazil as if he can pass to Fred then passing to Draxler should not be an issue. 

I don't care which striker is bought if his team mates are as discriminatory as these psg players then he will suffer.

I have no doubt that Icardi will score far more goals if he is fed chances.

It happened to Cavani and hearing Giroud say those things .It is not good at all.

"We won, but that was an underwhelming performance.

The only major positives I could think of was Messi’s debut, in which he showed a bit of rust, but mostly well. I can’t wait to see him in the starting XI with Di Maria, and Neymar Jr. Marquinhos (c) had a solid performance, but Abdou Diallo did struggle a bit. Good to see Verratti healthy. I’m not worrrid about Wijnaldum’s performances, he just joined the club, and he needs to adapt. It’s only his 3rd or 4th game, a bit of patience.  

We got outmanaged badly. It was bad, and Reims were the better team at many points in the match.

Naturally I would like to attend the match, but currently only tickets for the next match PSG vs. Clermont are on sale second-hand at the Ticketplace https://billetterie.psg.fr/en/. Is it because the later matches are too far away in the future? Or does it mean that I won't get a chance to buy second-hand tickets for PSG - Lyon via the Ticketplace anymore? A quick search doesn't seem to turn up relevant information.

If there is still a chance, when should I visit the website again to find out if there are second-hand tickets on sale? (I am aware that the ticket prices might be quite high for this match, of course.)

Anyway not really a surprise than Real Madrid are a spoiled fanbase.

"I think it's all about history and legacy. We're still building ours so it will take some time to get there.

But for example, a lot of people in my generation are fans of OM, because at that time, they were very strong and successful. Then a generation later, there were a lot of OL fans because they dominated the league and Juninho was magical. Then as for the current generation, kids are growing while watching PSG with players like Neymar, Mbappe, etc.

Let's not fool ourselves, when we were young, we loved our idols, and in the early 2000s, Juventus, Milan, Barca, Real, Bayern and other PL teams had amazing players...

And kids love that, and once they grow, obviously, they'll want to play in the club they loved to watch, Mbappe falls in the generation where CR7 and Messi were (and are still) at the top.

Well, that's what I think. In a few years, a lot of youngsters will want to play where Neymar, etc. played. Simple as that.",hamc0c7,pcsc13,psg,2021-08-28 07:29:34,Xentylia,6

Marseille last year was a total disgrace. Performances like those don't do any good to the image of the league and most players want to have competition to grow and get better.

And second thing is that PSG is historically a very young club that started to be succesful not that long ago. We're still building our history. It all depends of the person honestly, everybody is different. You will have players who will want to join something new and be the first to build history and you will have others who will want to play for the most famous clubs in the world with already established image. We had Moise who really wanted to stay and chose PSG over Juventus, also a big club, and we have now Camavinga who reportedly prefers PSG over English or Spanish clubs. All of this is really about personal preferences.

And yes, of course we need to finally win Champions League too. We talk about it for years now but still without real success. We need this win to show others that PSG is the right place to fight for all the trophies.",hal64nf,pcsc13,psg,2021-08-28 02:25:28,Desire_Is_Power,5

the case of Bayern and the bundesliga is a question of strategy, PSG has never wanted to crush the other teams like Bayern do with the rest of the bundesliga teams, Ligue1 teams really refuse to deal with us in good faith when its for their own interest.

"This is might  to be a slightly unpopular opinion here.

 The lack of champions league by French clubs (with the exception of Marseille) and absence of major dominance in the league means that over the time there is no real historical club in France. Certain generations have been big fans of different clubs but none that 
Have stayed throughout the generations. Thinking Lyon in the 00s, Marseille in the  80/90s, St-Etienne before that and Reims on the 50s/60s

Regional clubs sometime are in the heart of their supporters but none have a dominant national reputation that means all kids aspire to play for them. It is my opinion why you see a lot more french kid wanting to transfer abroad to more historical clubs than care to stay in France. That combined 

A huge untapped market by both our clubs (Paris and the rest of the league) and the league is Africa. Lots of the African populace speaks french and it could be an easy marketing target as so.  Besides African players don't count against the foreigner quota in France which makes it an even higher incentive.  Marseille has a bit of a reputation in Africa, why is Paris not attempting to build one or has never attempted to do so?

Paris as of today has always marketed itself hugely to south Americans (the list of significant players from there to have played for Paris goes on and on) however i don't think we are quit there yet in terms of appeal for those regions or are we?",hao2e7k,pcsc13,psg,2021-08-28 18:47:47,mmdoublem,1
"That's never going to happen while Ligue 1 teams get roasted in the CL consistently, Monaco the latest. PSG is the only club that can win titles and not get picked apart by the vultures of other leagues. We can see the only two winners of Ligue 1 since PSG have been Monaco and Lille, both have been absolutely plundered the summer of their win. It's just never going to happen while the league is still so weak. PSG winning the CL would be great, but it won't actually matter in regards to Ligue 1 as a whole and stopping talents from going abroad. 

The Bundesliga is similar to Ligue 1, but their infrastructures are much, much better, bigger stadiums, and people are more passionate about football there than in France. As much as I would like to see Ligue 1 be more competitive, it's hard to see how that happens short of billionaires coming in and pumping money into their clubs but with the TV rights revenue deals Ligue 1 gets as opposed to a team in the Premier League, no real businessmen would invest the hundreds of millions that would be necessary without a guaranteed return like the PL's TV rights give you. 

This season especially highlights that, the Premier League has a really juicy season ahead of them, between CR7's return to United, City's dominance, Chelsea's winning the CL, and Liverpool still being a factor, it's as exciting as it gets. I hate to say it because English people's head already get so big about a league that's incredible without having much to do with actual English talent, but it's right now far away of what Ligue 1 could hope to produce in terms of entertainment and, most importantly, revenue",hanads7,pcsc13,psg,2021-08-28 12:31:05,GimmeSomeCovfefe,0

"In hindsight, it was the wrong decision to let go of Silva. But at the time, our rationale for moving on from him was a combination of negotiations going wrong and that we wanted to entrust the Kimpembe and Marquinhos defensive pairing in the future. 

Kimpembe ended up being quite poor without any competition for his spot, and it clearly showed he needed some leadership next to him. When Marquinhos was not next to him, he looked lost. We assumed Kimpembe would be able to step up as another leader in our defence, but he hasn't really shown it before when Silva was still around.

Last season proved we needed a new CB, so we brought in Ramos, another leader. It was a shame we let go of Silva just like that last year, and he has the right to feel hard done by this, but Silva wasn't in the market this summer so we got whoever's available in the market. If Silva was available this summer, I'm pretty sure we would've at least considered bringing him back.

"i didn’t follow soccer when he first signed, but i’ve always loved watching him play and has been my second favorite behind Neymar. The way he moves and operates on the field is so aesthetically appealing to me. 

I’ll always like Mbappe and I have a france and PSG kit with his name on it, but I’ve lost some respect for him the last few months. I wish he had publicly made his intentions more clear a few months ago if he knew he wouldn’t be staying past this contract. Leaving a week before the window is over backed us into a corner and this is an urgent season for this group, not being able to properly replace him will sting. We are his hometown club, after all. I knew he wanted to go to Madrid eventually, but I wish he gave our project more urgency and could have given us another two seasons or so. If he promised he wouldn’t leave for free, couldn’t he sign a one year extension, give MNM a run and then depart for a fee next summer? He is still so young and has time to go to RM.

"I wasn’t too thrilled about him signing at first so I’d say that I was neutral. Then my opinion changed positively after a few months.

Then I noticed that on the field he was mostly looking/playing with Neymar and his game became predictable. Or how when he’s been frustrated/underperforming he would be way too selfish (understandable to some degree) and that would end up in missed occasion. But others then that you can’t deny that he’s talented and it was really nice to see him play for the club. 

And honestly I didn’t believe the reports about his attitude at first. But as time gone by I was getting more and more annoyed. And tbh I was just hoping that he didn’t leave the club for free. Especially after all his demands about having a competitive team but still wanting to leave when they have met his demands. I don’t get it.

Real is not the same team they were a few years ago, they have alot of old players who are at the end of their prime time.

He is 22 years old, he could leave in 2 years and still be young as fuck.

It is very very tempting for him and I don’t blame him one bit for wanting to leave for that. However, why would you want to leave now when you have the chance of playing with Neymar and Messi in what could be the best front three of all time. He doesn’t even know what the situation in Real could be in a year, there squad is very old and ageing quick, no one is getting any younger and there young players now doesn’t really look like they could replace what Benzema, Modric, Kroos, Marcelo are doing now. We will see though what is to come soon.",haho6g0,pc9e4t,psg,2021-08-27 07:43:25,Erayy102,1

Yes, Real Madrid is similar but the spotlight of being on a team fronted by Mbappe, Neymar, Messi must burn. If you lose a match the world will be so cruel. I bet just being Messi adjacent can be painful for life even when you are already a superstar.

"I think the majority of PSG fans won’t remember him positively at all. Reddit doesn’t represent supporters really well since it’s mainly an American website community. 

French PSG fans hate him for betraying the club. He pretended to have the perfect communication all along and just couldn’t admit he just wanted to go to Real Madrid. 

Right now, all the videos picturing him negatively are coming out on social media. Him speaking Spanish in the corridor before games to non-Spanish speaking players. Him getting in a rant with Tuchel, being disrespectful to staff members. All his previous interviews with France Football, RMC, etc are getting pulled out word for word. 

Right now, there is even an interview of the FFF president Noel le Graet where he says Kylian was begging him for support after the game against Switzerland when he missed his penalty. He created a whole rant during the Euros about who should be penalty takers… 

Now Olivier Giroud isn’t part of l’équipe de France anymore because of him and Benzema so his image is deteriorating in France.

"The problem I have with Mbappe leaving is :

&amp;#x200B;

1) He's young  
2) He's french  
3) He's world class and will probably be top 3 or top 5 itw

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that's hard to replace, he was, imo, perfect for us. If he leaves, that will leave us with only Kimpembe as the only french starter... In a french team... (We're not even sure how it'll turn out once Ramos is able to play again)  


As for his replacement, I'm definitely against any 30+ players (CR7, Lewan, etc.).   
Haaland seems unlikely, as much as I'd want him to come, he's against World Cup in Qatar and Dortmund don't want to sell him.  


So what can we do? Nothing aside from strenghtening other lines, especially our left back. The best thing we could do is probably get : T. Hernandez, Camavinga and why not bring back Coman since Di Maria is getting old.   
That would bump up the squad to 4 french players, and we can always try our chance for Haaland or another world class player to replace Mbappe next summer.  


One thing for sure though, I hope we won't do some bullshit panic buy (Richarlison, etc.)... We should invest smartly, and not rashly for the sake of not losing face.",hafe6y9,pbxpuc,psg,2021-08-26 22:20:53,Xentylia,8

"We need a number 9, but I don't think there are many top-class strikers in the market. Lewandowski and Haaland are probably unrealistic, the former for his age and that Bayern are unlikely to sell late in the window, and the latter because our whole squad trolled him. 

We can spread the Mbappe money across our squad (to improve obvious positions). I can't think of any strikers though. Maybe we can take Moise Kean back on a loan (or permanently for less than 30m).

I know he’s close to sign with City, but considering the wage cut he accepted and the relatively low transfer fee, wouldn’t it make sense to sign him for 2 years to go all out in UCL with Messi and Ramos, who most probably will stay for only 2 years as well?

Also as someone who’s watched pretty much every game of Messi for last 4-5 years, he’s not effective as a false 9 in the last couple of years as he was in 2010-2013.

"I remember how elated I was when we signed Kylian, how optimistic it made me about the future of Ligue 1. I was convinced of his potential to be the face of world football and it's next big star. The golden boy who would inspire other French youth to stay home &amp; elevate their domestic competition. 

I thought we'd get to see him grow under Tuchel along with Diaby, Nkunku, Kouassi, Weah, Aouchiche, etc. That we were trending towards a French team, led by French &amp; Parisian players, that would lay the foundations of something truly unique &amp; special. 

Fast forward to today, and I'm as sad about the outlook of our club as as I've ever been. I hardly even recognize who we are anymore, and I no longer have faith in our leadership or direction. In fact I fear that when Kylian leaves, it will cement us as a club without a soul. 

So what we signed Messi &amp; Ramos? It's deeper than the names on the back of the shirts, and they're relics of quickly fading era besides. Once the story on their respective careers closes within the next few years, where do we go from there?

"If Mbappé leaves, do you guys think a 3-5-2 system could work with Messi and Neymar upfront? 

I am asking this because PSG might not have the time to buy a decent forward. Nonetheless, the 3-5-2 worked pretty well for Koeman's Barcelona, as it provided width and rapid ball progression. For example, Hakimi could be a perfect fit to mimic Jordi Alba's role as a wingback.

I don't see Messi working as a False 9 anymore. He lacks the pace and stamina needed to drop back constantly and execute the role properly. 35yr Messi works best moving between opposition's lines.

"# LEONARDO: ""KYLIAN MBAPPÉ HAS ALWAYS PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE THE CLUB FREE""

**While Real Madrid have passed on a €160m bid to secure the services of Kylian Mbappé this mercato, PSG sporting director Leonardo is countering.**

_How do you react to the offer from Real Madrid?_

Leonardo: We haven't had much public communication about it, but our position has always been to keep Kylian, to extend him, that has always been our objective and that is still the case. We made two important offers to Kylian: one at the level of the top players in the squad two months ago and one above those players very recently. We want to prove to him that he is an important player, at the centre of the project, but not above the project. In relation to Real's position, it looks like a strategy to get a no from us, to show that they have tried everything and to wait a year to get him free. Real has been behaving like this for two years, it's wrong, illegal even, because they have contacted the player. It's unacceptable for us, because it's not right. This is the proof of the strategy: an offer comes a year before the end of his contract and 7 days before the end of the mercato. They want a refusal to show Kylian that they have tried everything and start negotiating for next year.

_Did you refuse this offer?_

Leonardo: Yes, we said no verbally. But we are not holding anyone back. If someone wants to leave and our conditions are met, we will see. But we have created a dream with our players this summer and we won't let anyone destroy it. We see the offer as a far cry from what Kylian represents today. We also owe some of this money to Monaco and we consider that the offer is not enough.

_It is indeed an offer of 160 million?_

Leonardo: I can't confirm the figures, but it's around that. It's less than what we paid him. But it's mainly the way Real Madrid do things that we don't like.

_Does Mbappe want to leave?_

Leonardo: Kylian Mbappé wants to leave, that seems clear to me. If Real Madrid makes an offer, that seems clear to me... I give a position, which I think is clear to everyone. We can't change our plans in the last week of the mercato. If he wants to leave, we won't hold him back, but it's on our terms.

_Have you spoken with Kylian Mbappé?_

Leonardo: With Kylian, we spoke a lot, he always told us the same things.  Kylian has always promised that he would not leave the club for free. That's what he always told us.

_Is the door open for him to leave?_

Leonardo: We have never opened the door to a departure. NEVER. People say I want to sell and Nasser doesn't, but I or Nasser think the same thing. We are on the same wavelength. We defend the club. Our objective is to extend him and keep him. But if a player wants to leave, it's on our terms, it's not just for Kylian, it's for all the players.

_Are you expecting a new offer?_

Leonardo: We don't plan to talk to Real Madrid again. The deadline is midnight on 31 August. That's how the mercato is, for us it's clear: we keep him and we extend him. But we're not going to let him go for less than we paid for him when we still owe Monaco money.

_Do you have a plan B?_

Leonardo: I'm not preparing anything on the market at the moment. He has a one-year contract, we want to extend him. We have never thought of a plan B. We have created a very positive atmosphere. We won't let anyone change that.

"Madrid fan here, coming in peace. I just don't understand Leonardo. Why is he comparing the 160mil to how much they paid for Mbappe. It's not the same thing. Mbappe is on last year of contract and wants to leave. It's obvious he's gonna sign with Madrid for free next year if he's not sold. Considering that, 160mil is an amazing offer because it's either than or nothing. 

He's accusing Perez of being disrespectful but he was very respectful the whole window. He asked for negotiations but Psg basically told him to fuck off. Khelaifi said Mbappe will NOT leave. You don't just bid the maximum you can afford to. That's what negotiations are for. If he still has a figure in mind for which he'd be willing to sell Mbappe for he should just give an amount like every other club does .

"# Leonardo on Mbappé transfer: ""Real's offer is far from what we consider sufficient""

**PSG's sporting director confirms that Real Madrid have indeed sent an offer of around €160m for Mbappé. But this proposal is largely insufficient in the eyes of the Parisian leaders.**

Leonardo, the sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain, returned this Wednesday afternoon, during a conference call with some media, on the offer of Real Madrid of 160 million euros transmitted to the club of the capital to buy the last year of contract of Kylian Mbappé. The Brazilian manager confirmed that an offer close to that amount had indeed arrived on his desk. But we have verbally said no to Real Madrid,"" he said. It is far from what we consider to be a sufficient value, far from what we paid for the same player at 18 years old (editor's note: 180 million euros), especially since we will have to pay part of that sum to Monaco (about 35 million euros).""

PSG is therefore putting the ball back in Real Madrid's court and expects the Spanish club to increase its offer by the end of the summer mercato scheduled for 31 August. The sporting director has indeed repeated that Mbappé remains the club's priority for the next few seasons, but for the first time he has clearly opened the door to a departure of his 2018 world champion.

""The club's position has always been to keep and renew Kylian's contract. There have been several meetings in this sense, and it remains our objective.

We're not closing the door on anyone but we haven't received a new offer (editor's note: from Real for Mbappé).""

In passing, Leo complains about the attitude of the Spanish club. ""This proposal seven days before the end of the mercato looks like a strategy of Real Madrid to get a no from us, and then say that they have tried everything to have the player free in less than a year,"" notes the Brazilian. But it's been two years that Real have a disrespectful, incorrect and even illegal attitude since you don't have the right to contact a player directly. It's unacceptable.""

The Tricolor striker also took a swipe at the club, as if the link between the two parties had been permanently broken. ""Kylian has always promised that he would never leave the club free. So we can't say we're happy,"" Leonardo sighed.",haalqs4,pbbyn1,psg,2021-08-25 22:09:06,Rerel,1

"What had to happen happened...  

We can blame several entities for this fall: French clubs, LFP (also its superior the FFF), and UEFA.   

• French clubs fight every year to get into the UCL or UEL, but most of the time it's only to benefit from the bonuses they are entitled to when they are in these competitions. Once in, it always becomes an excuse not to play some matches (in Ligue 1 or UEL): we have already seen clubs sending B (or C) teams in UEL, clubs saying in press conferences that the players are tired because they have already played during the week (like Rudi Garcia at OM)...   
We can also talk about the fact of systematically selling its best players abroad while no club in Europe does that at the same level...   

• LFP (Ligue de Football Professionnel) should take care of managing and developing its championship as well and as much as possible... NO. When they saw that France was world champion, they put in their mind that Ligue 1 is the best championship in the world and therefore that TV broadcasting rights are worth a lot, very much; the most expensive possible (""if the Premier League is worth 1 Billion per year, why not us? We deserve it anyway, don't we?). This demotion has been a sword of Damocles for years... Ligue 1 could only be caught up since it was so far from Bundesliga...  
What kind of league is the Ligue 1? Offensive (like the Bundesliga)? Defensive (like Serie A)? Intense (like the Premier League)? Technical (like La Liga)? No one knows since there is no clear common direction... In this case, how can you be someone who counts, how do you want to be a leader, without even having a strategy?   

• Do we have to specify the methods of UEFA? Always liked to discuss with the big historical clubs \[fortunately we managed to be able to discuss with them too\], champion of corruption \[oops, Čeferin said that to fight against it, we should not talk about it...\]. The famous ranking is based on a number of points accumulated in UEFA competitions, except that the bigger you are as a club and the more points you accumulate since you're in the best competitions (UEL points are worth almost nothing against UCL points), especially since for a few years the top 4 in the ranking are entitled to 4 direct qualifiers; so almost impossible to overtake these 4...    
By the way UEFA you write it as you want: U€FA, MafiUEFA, etc... It's not very important and above all; it means the same thing   

We hope that Monaco will beat Donestk tonight to take back these points (and our place)...",habsraq,pbb6i8,psg,2021-08-26 02:59:49,LukeGeme,18

I personally think it's totally backwards. Bundesliga is way less competitive but this archaic coefficient crap puts more teams in ucl. It's a self fulfilling prophecy with little room for other leagues to get better chances. Ligue 1 is a farmers league but it's where everyone poaches talent from. The best league is where the money is. It used to be serie A bc they had the money. Then premiere league was formed to make a boatload of money and what do you know all the good players go there and people say it's the best league.

"Disagree. A motivated Mbappé is a joy to watch and one of my favourite players. However, even if he is on the team, that's not a guarantee of winning the Champions. Him being on the team and a January agreement with Real has potential to cause issues in the locker room.

Why not sell Mbappe for like 180M and get Ronaldo + Camavinga + Theo Hernandez?",ha7bs6b,pauipm,psg,2021-08-25 03:59:14,mrkesh,50

"He is shitting on us with lies about the competitivity of the team, he even said during euros ""i call nasser everyday to see who he is gonna buy"" He just wanted a reason to leave and not get trashed by fans. Unlucky for him we had one of the biggest transfer window in history. I'm disapointed in him, if he said clearly that Real is his dream club there wont be any problems but the lies man...

"Weird situation, Real is absolutely dumb for signing a player for that amount of money with a year left on his contract, but on the other hand PSG is absolutely dumb for rejecting an offer with a player one year left on his contract. Take the money reinvest in the weak spots such as LB, such as Theo Hernandez, get another midfielder, such as Camavinga or Pogba (Although unlikely at this point), and maybe a striker? Although I think Neymar-Messi-Di Maria will still be a deadly front three.

As for Mbappe, he is absolutely dumb for leaving this team, which is the best chance they will have at winning the UCL. Run the last year, and get even more money in your pockets from Real next season when you sign for free.",ha7sqee,pauipm,psg,2021-08-25 05:55:23,Uyemaz,4

"Might get downvoted but I’m going to be honest ... Mbappe leaving will hurt me much more than the happiness I received by seeing messi is now in Paris. 
I know it seems like there’s no way he will stay regardless but I really hoped he did as our future .

"Mbappé will be gone by the end of the week, let's face it. interview with a spanish media the morning, offer in the evening, come on. But you can still salute Nasser for actually making profit in this transfer window where there is basically no money and with all those recruits. And let's be honest, selling your asset 160M€ in his last year of contract is a miracle, that will cover any comptable move in the next five year when a new FPF will be set up (and it will). Being in good terms with UEFA is more important for Qatar than Mbappé.",ha7fe0p,pauipm,psg,2021-08-25 04:23:16,Mathiuuus,6

It also tells you how much money the ownership has.  Any other club would be forced to sell to get a hefty transfer fee.

"The scoreline flatters us tbh. Last week we got bailed out by Navas and a red card, this week we got bailed out Navas and brest gifting us goals(yes the strike was good but any decent gk saves it). 

It's been happening since last season, we just shut off during the end or even second half. 

Also it's not like kehrer has been dogshit or something, it's clear the system at times is leaving holes. Especially the fullback positions.

Ik it's just early days and the whole squad is left to come but still we don't need Messi Ramos for all that, it's stills pretty unacceptable. 

Either way ALLEZ PARIS and so happy to see ADM score(and that too the winner).",h9plpmc,p8duke,psg,2021-08-21 05:04:32,Inte24,24

"Positives : 

- We are shooting and scoring from the midfield, I cannot believe my eyes.

- Hakimi, what a player.

Negatives : 

- Our defense is a Swiss cheese 

- Our system. I seriously don’t understand Poch. We are clearly overrun and losing a lot of balls uselessly, Brest is breathing down our neck, getting closer and closer to scoring. Why the hell does he not do something ? Stop the losange, go for a system where we can contain the adversity better. We are already leading, contain the score, get some control back in the game. Honestly I’m really not a fan so far, and I’m a bit worried since I am yet to see a play style of something that looks like a strategy…",h9pq6dv,p8duke,psg,2021-08-21 05:36:21,HaaamGirl,10
"We won, but the victory had a little bitterness to it.

Kimpembe and Diallo were absolutely shocking today. Diallo especially, I like him a lot, but he was getting massacred on the left side.

Thilo Kehrer was very decent today.

Hakimi, Mbappé, and Verratti were very interesting today. Good to see Verratti back today.

All 4 of our goals were great goals, a rare occasion. Gueye’s goal will be a contender for the goal of the season.

I hope Mauro Icardi’s injury is nothing serious.

I got high hope for him I'm sure he'll find his marks in the games to come

&amp;#x200B;

Thats not gonna happen on PSG, if the try to defend Messi with 3/4 players, Mbappe and Neymar will have alot of space to play, the same will happen to Neymar and Mbappe.

I don't think the same thing applies to Real Madrid.  We actually have a relationship with RM that's respectful.  I don't know how desperate the failure - right now - of the ESL makes Madrid/Florentino, but not so desperate that they want to have a PR disaster like coming hard for Kylian and still missing.  That would make PSG the king, and LaLiga titans all the king's serfs...",h9ah843,p5zm8u,psg,2021-08-17 21:59:58,UniversalNoir,3

Messi should play more centrally. That’s where he performs best. He’s not a true winger and won’t track back but if you have Neymar and Mbappe on the wings those are spaces they can both exploit with their pace.

"I’m against transferring Mbappé for multiple reasons: 

- first we won’t be able to get 170-180 millions and that’s what we should be selling him for since 35 million of the transfer would go to Monaco and we need money to replace him
- we can’t replace him this summer, Dortmund isn’t going to sell Haaland within the last two weeks of the mercato
- there isn’t enough time to negotiate with Madrid, Dortmund and Haaland.
- keeping Mbappé and playing him along Neymar and Messi will piss a lot of Madrid fans who will see him as the guy who loves playing with ex-Barca players. 
- I would rather not make any money, disgust millions of Real fans by forcing them to see Mbappé hug Neymar and Messi for another season.

I feel we should re-examine Tuchel's infamous idea of playing Marquinhos as 6. He's our only player smart enough to articulate our play in front of our defense and anticipate the risks. We're so vulnerable on transitions and counters especially with Pochettino's risky style that leads to many losses of dangerous balls. Our gegen-press is not on City/Chelsea/Liverpool/etc levels (and will never probably be except for big CL-level ties) to hope that we'll extinguish our opponents quick transitions. I fear we'll concede too many goals in the next months until something is done in the defensive midfield part.,h90irfi,p4orv4,psg,2021-08-15 17:48:05,deepfrench,8
"Kimpembe is kimpembe he does stupid things all the time.

But where was his partner Kehrer in both headed goals? 

He was nowhere to be seen both time and that is not good enough at all.

Kimpembe cannot be expected to cover his partner and do his job at the same time all the time

They also need legs in midfield somebody that can cover the ground very well and very quickly.

What's with all the pampering of the players? Ricarlison play down scored for Everton yesterday and he played in the Olympics final after playing in the Copa America final.

I am sure Pau Lopez played in the super cup final as did Jorginho who also played yesterday. He took part in the champions League final as well as the European championship final but he's back.

Yesterday in the stands I saw Paredes, Di Maria and Neymar.

Marquinos on the bench.

Man of the Maych is Kylian Mbappé for me, he had a couple of assists, and was unplayable on the left flank. Draxler played really well also, and Hakimi too. Kimpembe and Kehrer were disappointments.

"Gini had a good first half but disappeared in the second half..mostly because of the opponents keeping a lot of possession in the first 15 mins after half time which forced him to play deep which just only gives us the liverpool Winjaldam. 

He is all over the pitch but hardly gets a touch and is not as good as gueye in that role but he is anti-press and is almost impossible to get the ball off him but that's about it really....he plays deep.. Keeps the ball and passes it sideways or backwards since he plays so deep theres no urgency to give vertical passes.

You can’t just make a line up that fits all your studs just because it looks good on paper. Some people are gonna get benched and I think these people already know that. This a good thing though because we finally have quality back ups for when we inevitably get injuries mid season. Di Maria, Kimpembe, and Donnaruma are gonna be depth players and that’s ok. Our fullbacks are extremely offensive so we’re gonna have to play with a DM that most likely is gonna include one of Gueye or Danilo (whether people like it or not because that’s what we have) maybe Marqui plays up there or we play a 3 man back line.",h8v2103,p3ra2f,psg,2021-08-14 10:08:00,96lowky,2
"I highly doubt.

I've being following Messi in Barcelona and Argentina for 10+ years, and although he was tested there as an attacking midfielder (classic 10), he was just ok at best.

There he's too far from the opposing goal, placed in a crowded area surrounded by 2 to 3 opposing midfielders. He'll end up being always shut down (sometimes coming back deep to the DM or even CB position, cause the times he was tested as an attacking mid, he was always dropping close to Busquets or even Piqué just to receive the ball freely) and you'll just get half of what Messi can actually do. It works on a video game, it may feel like he just works fine there with his vision and passing, but I never ever saw him play well there.

The thing about being a false 9, is that Messi is placed in a void between the defenders and DM, so no one is sure who's really responsible for marking the number 30.
If the DM tries to man mark the argentinian, he'll leave a lot of space for Verrati and Wijnaldum. And a defender can't man mark Messi, cause he can't disrupt the offside line.

With a striker up high, the midfielders can focus their eyes on Messi, while the lone attacker is against 2 defenders.

Current Messi's best position is a hybrid of False 9, Classic 10, RW and 2nd Striker coming from the right to the middle.

He needs space and freedom to roam in that huge area.

Also, he won't help defending. Rarely you'll see him running back and being tactically well positioned in the defensive phase.

Unfortunately Di Maria will end up warming the bench  at least against TOP teams (unless the opponent parks the bus and wait for counter attacks all game. Guess in this situation, your formation is welcomed, but still risky). Guess he'll have to adapt his game if he wants to be part of the starting XI in the Champions League, or replace a tired Mbappé.

Honestly, Paredes needs to play more than Di Maria if they want a well balanced team.

We are in August now and just recruited Messi. Mbappé hasn’t liked a single Instagram post of PSG recently. He hasn’t made a single declaration on his decision for his future. The longer he stays silent the worse it gets. 

I think Mbappé was betting on a new blunder transfer window from our now honorary DS to have the pretext of his legitimate departure.

But anyways, I’m coming from the US in September to visit the Parc. I’ve always wanted to experience soccer in a European country. With Messi coming and playing for the club, the experience of watching soccer in the stands with the sound of ultras just got 100x better with the presence of a GOAT playing on the field. Which I feel is a once in a life time experience for me! 

I am super excited for this experience. And one of the biggest things I am looking for in my trip to Paris. See y’all at the Parc against Clermont.",h8iduh9,p27vnt,psg,2021-08-11 15:47:20,FeezusShuttlesworth,11
"Hi PSG fans one frustrating thing about messi is that he strolls on the pitch a lot. In games where it’s very tight this May anger you. He usually makes it up because he would have created or scored at that point but it’s honestly something very frustrating.

Also no matter who you have in the squad or gonna sign, signing either Messi or CR7 gonna boost your club’s reputation and image in every corner of the world, especially since it’s the first time Messi joined a club in his pro career after Barca.

"Paris could pull off something epic next season.

Kylian Mbappé clearly wants to go to Real Madrid. He’s been complaining about Paris’s sporting project, but now he has no excuses not to be convinced by it. Paris could extend his contract by a short period, then sell him next summer after the World Cup. Recuperate the money, then sign Cristiano Ronaldo, who will see his contract expire next summer, for free. This leads to an attack of Neymar - C. Ronaldo - Messi, and it accomplishes the dream of many people who want to see Messi and C. Ronaldo play together.

It’s a very short term plan due to the ages of C. Ronaldo and Messi, but it would be epic nonetheless.",h8gbu4r,p1xc2t,psg,2021-08-11 04:29:59,ParisLake2,7

"From what i saw yesterday Hakimi isnt a fullback but a wingback so the best formation for PSG imo would be 

         Neymar.  Mbappe

         Messi.                           Hakimi 

       Verratt.  Parades  Gini 

     Kimpembe. Ramos Marquinhos.  


So imo the best the best formation would be playing 3 Cbs but playing without LWB. 
 
Neymar Mbappe CFs, Messi CAM, Varratti Parades Marquinhos midfield, Hakimi RWB and Kimpembe Ramos Marquinhos CBs 

This would be a really balanced formation 3 world class attackers, 2 best play makers of the world and Hakimi constanly making those runs.

In midfield Verratti for control and creativity, Parades to pick the ball from defense and aggressiveness and Gini to cover for the lack of work rate from the front line (he's a perfect workhorse for this team) and Gini also makes 2nd man runs inside the box from midfileld, can play with his back to goal so thats another attacking option.


In defense the defensive trio, i didnt use LWB because having these 3 CBs would make us really strong in defense specially against counters

"I am wondering how this new trident could work and I‘m kinda thinking about Messi and Neymar sharing a false 9 role. 

We see that a traditional striker (9) like Icardi gets isolated from our play, so Messi and Neymar sharing the hyprid 10 and 9 positions could open up a lot of possibilities with Mbappe being the second striker to them. 

It‘s quite the risk with them walking over each others feet, but the chemistry between Ney and Messi is known, just like Ney and Mbappe. 

I can‘t say that it would work or that it‘s good in the first place, but sacrificing the pure striker could be an option (IMO)",h85xtwy,p09zdb,psg,2021-08-08 20:55:47,wutend159,6

"What i saw is that wiji and icardi could've contributed much more but the play style that we use didn't help. It showed in the pass map, they did multiple forwards runs but didn't receive any balls from the pivots. Its always pivots to wingers and wingers to mid, its getting pretty old and easy to defend against. Especially that defending teams like this where they have 10 players on defense require speed, but our midfield can't seem to pass forwards between the lines. Hope this will change when verrati and paredes come in, but all in all i still see the same problems from previous seasons. Nothing changed yet, disappointing first match",h85g3s1,p09zdb,psg,2021-08-08 16:54:35,JxMedo,5
"First game of the season so much fitness would always be a problem.



Having said that there is really excuse for some of those players like Herrera, Hakimi, Diallo, Kehrer, Draxler and icardi as they did not go to the euros or Copa America.



The Troyes players seemed fitter and it was just a lack of quality that made them lose.


Hakimi is not a full back and it showed yesterday night.


Draxler and Wijnaldum were completely anonymous.



Herrera was only good playing balls over the top when he had to play the ball on the floor he gave it away all the time.



His partnership with danilo midfield is just horrendous and thank goodness we will not see it too much this season.



Kimpembe is a joke captain make far too many schoolboy errors.



He also needs a vacation which I do believe the manager should do to lots of players this season.



If they are slacking just give him time off as there are enough players to cover anyway.



Diallo is not good enough as a left-back going forward and they may need to go to the transfer market to get a better player.



There should be two goals very well though.



It is quite obvious the manager doesn't rate Rafina at all but nevertheless his substitutions have to be earlier and so much better.



Going by some of the post on here this season should be fun on the pitch but absolutely unbearable on here with all the new Messi fans.",h85fghz,p09zdb,psg,2021-08-08 16:44:48,denco2019,1

"Seeing the game again...Hererra was fantastic [defensively as well] ..hope its not a one match wonder tho... Navas as usual saved the sinking ship yet again. Hakimi is absolute fire. Icardi and mbappe were decently good..but in some cases..icardi had more work ethic than mbappe..even tho mbappe was crucial on the counters tho he could have provided more width for gini or hakimi to tuck in sometimes and was a tad lazy...hopefully he nods it off soon.

 It was not entirely Gini and draxler's fault that they ghosted...or played bad....they just weren't able to get involved in the build up. It was mostly thilo-Herrera-hakimi- mbappe/icardi i personally think draxler plays better at proper hold up play type winger in a 4-2-3-1 
Rather than a hybrid LM/LW . As for gini... I think maybe it was because of the slow build up play by psg especially in the second half... Danilo and Hererra are not that quick passing kinda midfeilders that modern football needs..and poch can't do anything about it..they are just not gonna be fast..but since danilo and herera are Physically superior and poch just wants to park the bus and somehow limit the damage after taking a narrow lead , he doesn't make a goddamm substitution fearing that might disturb their setup as our titis are young and physically inferior , so poch sticks with them..this was not the type of mentality we had when we faced barca in camp nou...we just didn't stop attacking till the last minute irrespective of the scoreline and the subs. I saw gini's heatmap to see that he all the touches were mostly deep and going forward he didn't get a touch.
                  
   So maybe now with verratti gueye paredes back gini might stay in his preferred AM position and start getting less marked after the arrival of ney, angel and ""you know who"" and moreover we need some quick buildplay from the back and poch needs to figure that out as well. And oh yes i am expecting a redemption season from Herrera , kehrer and icardi.

"We have to wait for the deal and the details but 40m/year is incredibly good business. Messi was bringing over 140m to Barca, ofc this won't be the same at PSG but I m pretty sure he'll basically finance his wages. Paying 40m-50m/y (amortize signon bonus and papa's fees) is basically having Messi for free. Any bank would finance that and any club can theoretically afford him, which puts some light on the immense butthurt other clubs and supporters experience:   
Messi is chosing PSG without a second thought because only PSG offers him the perfect combination of top club, top city, trophies, competition for CL and many friends (Neymar Paredes Di Maria etc etc).

I am not against the Messi signing. But I am a little sad that we weren't able to win a CL with Neymar and Mbappe as the leaders. I think that those 2 leading us to our first CL would have been the completion of our redemption arc. Now if we win the CL the narrative will be that 'Messi came to PSG and brought them the first CL'. Obviously I want to win the CL and I don't really care how it happens but I would have liked to see Neymar prove that he can do it on his own.,h8154lo,ozojv7,psg,2021-08-07 15:10:22,NostosOrKleos,17

"I see all the Barca fans scapegoating Barto now that they're bankrupt.

Yes Barto made poor decisions and was quite shady but he wasn't the sole blame. By contrast, I think his spending strategy reflects the mindset of people that voted for him. Let's be honest, the socios voted for him, because Barcelona's ultra aggressive investment strategy delivered highly sensational player purchases and short term results. The same strategy that got Barcelona the Treble (through spending 100s of million of players like Neymar and Suarez while paying a single player 100m a year) also got them to the edge of bankruptcy when Covid hit. No one was complaining they were spending too much when they won the treble. But with the highs also comes the lows. A well run club like Bayern doesn't spend like Barca specifically because of what could happen if things go wrong like it did recently.

Its hilarious watching all the fans now scapegoat a president they once praised instead of learning to temper their spending and expectations like Bayern or even Real Madrid recently.

It seems like they still haven't learned their lesson. What does the next president do immediately after inheriting the financial situation and knowing they are way above the wage cap? Sign more players!!!!!!

"Barca was built around Messi for more than a decade.

PSG was not built for Messi. It is impossible to build the PSG around him for the future considering he is 34. What I mean is that Messi would not perform the same as when he was in Barca, because he won' have the team literally made for him. 

The player may also suffer from post-Barca depression. He has been in his club all his career. He will not feel at home before a long while. He will not be as happy as he was in Barcelona.

In case of bad performance from Messi, analysts will start telling the structure and foundations of the PSG are bad and not as good as in Barcelona. They will raise bullshits.

PSG can use the funds to seriously upgrade a few key positions.

Moreover,  if Mbappe and Madrid works out a secret deal behind doors so that Madrid will get him free next year while Mbappe gets himself a big fat Signing bonus, don't color me surprised. The bottom line is to sell him now, and don't be fooled by all BS. Mbappe will chase his dreams. He wants all the spotlights. Fine, good luck.

"This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion here, but his non-contractual renewal makes plenty of sense if he is trying to leave to go to Real Madrid. Today, nobody can afford his fee with the exception of clubs in England but I don't remember him ever saying he was interested in heading there. Most clubs around the world are in the gutter financially or threading a fine line (even us, to an extent I would say). There is absolutely no guarantee that the clubs will be in a better position next year and I cant see NAK let him go just because Mbappé wants to go. 

It is backstabbing to us that he can't come out and admit publicly that he wants to move on. Some players no matter what the sporting project is, want to move on to see different things, leagues, countries just like employees do. Where it hurts is him saying it was just the sporting project when clearly it wasn't just this.


I also find it very interesting that he want to only go to RM, at one time when they had Zidane who had spent years nurturing a relationship, it made sense, but now... Although from a sporting sense with Benzema winding down and his potential arrival, coupled with the departure of Bale, Modric . His arrival would usher Real Madrid in a whole new direction and sporting project and I think he realizes that.",h7jnjt8,owmpo7,psg,2021-08-03 20:33:00,mmdoublem,1

"Another thing I noticed that I hope they cut out is players getting in Hakimi's way like how Draxler did at the start of the second half.

He not only Got in his way he completely messed up the moves by always coming backwards on himself. Very vexing.

They need to play intelligently by having a player cut inside to make room for hakimi.

He he is not a winger with excellent dribbling skills he is a fullback that needs space to run into.

Yes Diallo missed a couple of sitters but overall it was useless possession at times.

Verratti being the only midfielder with creativity is not good at all.",h7esl95,ow9d3g,psg,2021-08-02 17:19:38,denco2019,6
"Having watched the game last night, it validated my view that some players just need to go by hook or crook.

There is no way that the youngsters will see any game time when seasoned professionals are sat on the bench 

It is not fair on pochettino as he will surely get stick but what is he supposed to do when players on big salary are not getting game time.

Some of these useless pros are good friends with the ""big boys"" at the club and these big boys will want their buddy to play even though they add nothing to the team.

Yes the game was meaningless in the grand scheme of things and not too many of those that played will see much game time but Pochettino cannot afford to be losing too many games.

I have no idea what he thought that midfield would bring to the table, they were just awful.

Created nothing and far too many counter attacks were launched straight from psg corner kicks against them.

If you can not create and cannot stop counters what exactly is your purpose?

Hakimi showed promise even if his final ball needs polishing.

I do hope when the big guys come back they do not monopolise the opposite flank as Hakimi can be a useful outlet.

Pochettino needs to find a way to win games when psg is behind as this is becoming a very bad trend.

He has a big few months coming up as people will start to ask if he is up for the job.

I know people want Pogba and all sorts of world class players but do you have a manager with the personality, skill and experience to mould them into a functioning unit?

Only time will tell and I for 1 want him to succeed.",h7enam8,ow9d3g,psg,2021-08-02 15:59:11,denco2019,10

What is also worrying, is that some players are offered chances to redeem but they just do not have the capacity to upgrade their level.

I will say that it's encouraging that we're playing 4-3-3 though, since it will fit our profiles better (Verratti, Paredes, Wijnaldum). Also I hope we can sign Pogba. We need to accelerate on that.
