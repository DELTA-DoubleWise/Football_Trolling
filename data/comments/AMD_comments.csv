"The thing with Suarez is he decides the play. He decides how others should play with his passes, his plays, his runs. So happy to have him on our team. He's gonna make everyone else around him better. And I have nothing to say about Llorente. That guy is a freak. He is so light when he is sprinting past everyone. This is such an exciting start to the season. This is what happens when you let the players play their game.",g6ux7ye,j0tgeh,atletico,2020-09-27 23:58:11,atmsmbk,92
"Can't wait till we see Felix and Suarez upfront, Llorente and Carrasco on the wing, Koke/Saul and Thomas as double pivot, and Josema - Felipe CB pairing.

Damn Suarez definitely still got it. To be having a generational talent in our team, I still can't believe it.

Also I really like how the team is set up for counter, give me vibes of Mourinho 4-2-3-1 counter attacking Madrid team.

Felix, Carrasco, Llorente, and Suarez really change our attacking flow.",g6ux9wp,j0tgeh,atletico,2020-09-27 23:58:41,rainsong94,65

Well if this game doesnt get you excited for the season.... (:,g6ux7yi,j0tgeh,atletico,2020-09-27 23:58:11,connector92,27
"
As you can see, today we saw a much more offensive Atleti. We had 56% possession, a figure we don’t usually see. The biggest change imo is how we attacked much faster during counters. With Carrasco, Felix and Correa, you could notice how quick we transited from defence to attack. Even more so during the second half because you know, Llorente is god damn fast. We are able to control the attacking tempo the whole game, thanks to the fact that Felix is taking well charge of it. He is our maestro, without a doubt. Every attackers looked hungry, even Vitolo and Lemar are doing well today, which is a very, very good look into the season.

The biggest drawbacks are, firstly the penalty missed and the midfield. Saul should do better there, but the fact is we need to make Felix our primary talent because he will be our talisman for year. He needs to take and improves them. 
For the midfield, I’m not really a fan of the Koke - Saul double pivots. They aren’t as physical and progressive, that’s why I think Partey is really needed here. I won’t mind if they improve in this role, but as of now they aren’t really that type of player to put here imo, especially Koke. Both of them play much better in an advanced role.

Couldn’t get the clean sheet is unlucky, but I think this match is more than enough to show we can be a really good offensive side. We need to maintain this performance, and if we do so I’m sure that we can win titles this year.


**Scoreboard:** 

Diego Costa 1 goal (1 sexy dummy as well)

Joao Felix 1 goal 1 assist

Angel Correa 1 goal 2 assists

Marcos Llorente 1 goal 1 assist

Luis Suarez 2 goals 1 assist

**Individual:**

Costa: Showing a much different character on the pitch today. Making more runs and you can feel his sense gels well with other attackers, especially the dummy for Felix's goal. A drawback is he still getting dispossessed a bit often and he isn't fast enough. Still, a really impressive performance for him which makes us hopeful for more of him this season.

Felix: Basically running the game. Easily MOTM. You can see him became much more confident and he's everywhere on the pitch today. Good interplays, vision, smart passing, and that composure in front of goal. If he maintains this performance this kid is gonna write history here. One thing to note, Felix should be our first penalty taker any time any day.

Correa: Decisive performance, Angel. At first I was confused since he kept giving away possession, but you know, Correa will somehow makes it count. Good cross for Costa, good technique for his goal and good run+good ball for Felix. There's nothing to complain for his performance today with 3 contributions. He was kinda lost after restart last season, but hopefully he can keep his consistency because we all know he is fantastic on his day.

Carrasco: Didn't get onto the scoreboard but still a good performance. His footwork and control really gave us life on the left. Had some good plays with Felix, and is a big threat in counters. I’m satisfied with his performance today, but he needs to show even more because Llorente is no joke right now. 

Koke, Saul: The duo had a quiet game but acceptable. Today they were better than vs Lepizig, and we progressed the ball better. However, you can still see both of them are much better playing higher up. I hope they can improve in this role because if we’re playing 4-2-3-1 as our main formation, they will be the pivots since Simeone never drops them.

Lodi and Trippier: Good performance on both ends, but lacking the preciseness in final third. Both of them got some good chances but the deliveries are a bit off. Did well moving the ball and defending though. Won’t think too much for the first game of the season, as I believe they will do good very soon.

Savic and Felipe: decent performance. I can’t rate this duo that high because I can’t really feel the synergy between them. For example the incident between them, they should never go for the ball at the same time. They need to find a way to complement the other instead of trying to be a good stopper on their own in every scenario. I hope they improve as it goes, but you know that Atletico vein won’t feel good when we concede, even when we’re up 4 goals, lol.

Oblak: good performance as usual. Had some good saves, the goal conceded isn’t really his fault. All I say is keep up the good performance, because Oblak is too flawless to be criticised every single game.

Partey: you can see he really progresses the ball with so much ease. The composure and passing are gold, which makes him the perfect player for our pivot. He didn’t play long so not much to say though, hope we can see him start in the next match. 

Llorente: GOAT. You know he’s gonna score once he came on lol, and he did so within a minute. His pace is out of this world which makes him so hard to mark, and you can see his delivery and composure are on point as well for Suarez’s goal. Not to mention his finishing are good af. Such a joy to watch. 

Vitolo, Lemar: I have to say, they had a good display. They seem more involved, and actually doing dangerous plays, such as Vitolo’s pass to release Llorente and Lemar’s through ball to Vitolo. I hope they can keep this up, because we all know they have the qualities in them, they just need to show it consistently.

Suarez: well, the best is for the last. What else can I say? 3 contributions in 20 minutes, and he could’ve got two more goals if he’s luckier. The impact he had on the team is insane. Look at that movement in the box, it is what we’ve been missing. He knows how to be the focal point of the attack, and I just can’t wait to see him pairing up with Felix. 

Conclusion, I can’t believe this is Atleti. I’m so impressed by literally every players, and I’m convinced that we can have a wonderful season coming for us. All it takes is, well, Cholo don’t revert to a defensive setup which sees us losing points stupidly again. Though, it’s barely the first game, we need to see more of this display in upcoming matches to see.

I dont think people realized that Suarez was on a really good goal scoring pace last year before he got injured. Like he actually had one of the best Goals/90 ratio in europe. His champions league form even returned to him. If he wasnt injured he probably would have scored close to 25 goals in the league last year.,g6v2xel,j0tgeh,atletico,2020-09-28 00:48:50,meertatt,5

The match was great and I'm super-happy. Yet this was against an exhausted Granada. After Correa's 2-0 it was over. I wouldn't read too much into it or expect to be Campeones this season.

We do know that Costa/Felix looks good. As does Suárez/Llorente against a demoralized and tired defence line. 

I'd keep my hopes in check for at least 10 games.

More than the result, which really freaks me out, the team looked confident and secure. Compared to how we played last season, this is amazing. 

Joao is going to have one amazing run this year. With Costa and Correa up front he was a monster with his passes. I can't wait to watch him play with Suarez and Llorente, but maybe the calendar won't allow it as much right now. 

Suárez... Oh boy. He's a monster and even if he plays like that in just 30 or 20 minutes, we all saw that the team improved a lot just by his movement. Hopefully he stays healthy and keep it up.

"I don't really support a club team, I'm Uruguayan and really just follow Uruguayan players, but Athletico's style consistently reminds me of the Uruguay NT and that's why I've always found myself preferring them. This year will be great for you guys. I've probably watched every single Uruguay game since 2010 and Suarez almost never underperforms. There are a ton of parallels between Athletico's style and Uruguay's style. Suarez knows how to play a high pressing counter-attack system and has had a ton of success within that system (Also IMO in this system Suarez plays his best football). People have massively overlooked this when Athletico made this move. Also, the fact that he has Simeone and a great team surrounding him solidifies you guys finding some success this season with the Champions League or La Liga. 

Overall impressive game for Suarez and this move allows Simeone to play the football he wants to play. To go back to the Uruguay comparison, last year's Athletico team reminded me of when Suarez was banned from football for like 6 months and our attack was just absolute shit, but once we got him back and revamped our midfield with Valverde, Torreira, Vecino, Nandez, and Bentancur we were amazing.

"Atletico fans know him so I won't write much about him as a Barca fan. He still scores and assists on a very good level. Higher than Costa and Morata. Yet he has a knee issue and can't run anymore. He can jog. So he stays in attack and can't outpace anyone or defend or run after a player. He therefore needs a ton of delivery to get those goals. If he gets that he will add needed goals to the starving Atletico attack but he is also getting injured more often and will be away for some months each season. I think he still has 2 La Liga season left in him. But he is not a main striker anymore. He doesn't score in CL away at all for example.

He also is one of the worst simple passers I have seen in attack. But if he needs to do a difficult pass he can. Basically, very good addition to Atletico but I still think the team would need one more forward. Suarez is just getting old.",g6dlt84,iykbjp,atletico,2020-09-24 09:47:44,JurijFedorov,2

"Good buy. A short term solution, but can create a long term impact. I do hope Felix learns a lot from him, especially finishing. As long as our full backs and midfielders keep on creating chances for him, he's likely to score - more likely than Morata to be honest. Having said that, Morata was someone who could dribble and hold the ball, he could sprint and create chances for others, that's why I wasn't too happy to see Morata go. Let's hope Suarez clicks for us and Felix goes up a few notches. If Morata really plays well I feel he can be recalled. But overall just looking at this season, I feel this is good acquisition. 

Btw I also heard that we were looking for Cavani. After Suarez, I feel it would be priceless. Let's see how it goes. 

Welcome Suarez!!!",g6e6zcm,iykbjp,atletico,2020-09-24 13:41:29,ak5effect,1

"If the Atleti attack can play like they did against Salzburg, we should be able to put the game to bed before the hour mark. 

If Gimenez were to play in the starting 11, I'd have more confidence in the defence.
We may have only conceded 1 league goal so far, but that was mainly thanks to Oblak.
Osasuna may not have the most threatening attack, but they should not be underestimated.

The UCL games show that we still need a lot of work in defence and holding and winning possession in midfield, so having Gimenez and Saúl back would help, but I wouldn't be surprised if Gimenez still didn't start if he still needs recovery time.

"I may sound harsh but this is not the performance I want to see. Good to bounce back and won the game, but how come we are behind at the first place?

If we lose today I’ll blame all the players but Simeone. A system is designed at best to create as much good chances possible, which we did, but it’s up to our players to finish these. We literally could’ve scored 10 goals ffs. And these individual errors leading to conceding dont look good as well. 

On the bright side, Felix and Correa were immense. Felix saved us, though he really should’ve got himself a hat trick at least. Correa assisted two and could’ve easily got 4 or more, what a day from him. Llorente is sexy as usual. The front 4 combined so well. Savic has a solid night too. And my boy Lemar finally involved in a goal, hope he gains some confidence back and do more for us. 

And the biggest criticism for me is the midfield. We need someone to control the tempo, not to give away the god damn ball every time under pressure. I hope Saul can help us once he’s back. And what’s wrong with these fullbacks horror show, Lodi and Tripp are horrible defensively recently, much worse than last season and they should work their ass off for that, their place isn’t guaranteed. 

Have so many things want to write down, but will leave it for the post post match thread. Important 3 points, hope we deliver in La Liga as well. Aupa Atleti.",gabhupx,jjav6l,atletico,2020-10-28 06:05:03,1ngK,13

"Hard to figure out who our starting CBs should be. Felipe is fantastic, but I feel like he hasn't been able to replicate his pre-lockdown form. Meanwhile Savic is playing really well, and Josema is probably the best on the rare occasions that he's fit

On another note, Felix is absolutely superb, I believe he can achieve and surpass everything Griezmann accomplished at Atleti, and shut up the haters who say ""he doesn't suit Simeone's system"", especially looking at his defensive contributions today. He won 13/20 duels! His composure has also massively improved, and he's a danger whenever he's on the ball

Correa and Llorente were electric, even with the 1v1 miss from Marcos, he was always looking to make something happen

Probably the weakest part of our game today was the fullbacks. Trippier was never where he needed to be defensively, and Lodi slipped for their first goal. leaving Szoboszlai open (what a signing he would be though)

Koke and Herrera were also kinda off with their passing today, but Koke will surely improve. Herrera has to work on being less error prone, that's two times he's given the ball away for a goal in this season's UCL.

"It is weird to see us conceding goals after following for such a long time! Undoubtedly Felix MOTM. Kudos to Llorente who's on fire consistently &amp; Correa too. We can agree that Josema was severely missed. Felipe is a good defender, but he has hit some kind of a patch of late. I hope he gets by well. Savic &amp; Oblak saved us, they really did. Trippier needs a break. He's been playing consistently, attacking as much as he can (and has been good in that area), but that's affecting his defensive game - Something that Lodi needs to improve A LOT. Maybe it's time to give our younger full backs more game time to develop their game and generate competition (Sanchez was good in his debut). 
Imo Herrera was unexpectedly bad defensively, but also unexpectedly good offensively. Some of his passes were incisive and creative, but his defensive error cost us a goal - very unlike us. Also very happy for Lemar. This assist might take up his confidence a few notches up - much needed. 
Let's hope with time we work on our shortcomings and keep improving the positives. Onwards and upwards!

Saul and Koke although provide alot of defensive support, I think we should go for a ballplaying Midfielder who can cut passes to our deadly attacks..someone who can dribble a bit and make good through passes..Since we have started having more attacks where we score because of playing traditional football rather than counter attacks..if we can get someone in the middle who could help us out in counter attacks, all 3 of llorente, Felix and Suarez would see a huge boost in their goals tally..

"The attack and midfield finally improved in terms of chance creation, but they still need to learn to be more clinical and finish those 1v1's.

As for the defence...
The sooner Gimenez, Saúl and Vrsaljko are back, the better.

They still give their opposition far too much space and let them play the ball out instead of trying to win it back immediately. The defence clumps together in the centre and thus make themselves susceptible to attacks from the wing, and even then can make terrible defensive mistakes.

That first goal was practically gifted by Tripper's tackle.

Once again Llorente and João Félix step up to secure the win, but... That was way too close.

Defensively it seems like our defense needs rotation and reshuffling as they are the only positions along with Oblak who are not substituted or switched in the lineup game after game. Conceding 6 goals in two games is too much and it seems like the defense is too exhausted to perform. Joao again MOTM and I am very happy with the performance of Correa, Lemar and Llorente. Solid game by the midfield as well. Next game against Osasuna I think they will play very defensively due to last season's result and we  kind of struggle against this style of play but let's get them.",gaclgde,jjav6l,atletico,2020-10-28 12:08:14,mos1992,1

Llorente keeps having to run back to save their asses every single time. Put Gimenez in there for all I  care, Herrera is not cutting it in the middle today. This is a much easier team to beat than the Betis side we played. They look like they have no philosophy on the pitch and defense is absolute shite, we should not even be letting them play. It's too easy to get through the midfield right now. 

Also, Joao can dribble all he wants but if he's not making the passes at the right time, shit ain't worth it. No doubt Llorente has been the best player today despite that miss. Simeone would love to have a team with 10 Llorentes. he's the perfect player for his style. He rarely loses the ball even when there are four players surrounding him.

"First thing, hope Carrasco recovers quick because we need him badly. 

The key point today is, we shouldn’t play the old counter attack system again. We don’t have the squad to do so, it’s a completely different set of players. Trippier has been shaky whole season and it’s worrying that we don’t have another RB right now. Players like Lemar, Torreira and Hermoso lost their calmness when we are winning the ball and trying to hold it, this misplacing all these easy passes.

Saul is the one we missed a lot, as you can see we lacked a CM being an available passing option and actually able to sustain possession. His defensive contribution is incomparable as well.

Suarez has been bad today, I don’t care he scored a goal in dying times or not. He wasted a lot of chances today to score one and ruined our attack for few times as well. 

Second half is lot better. Llorente MOTM without a doubt, he’s simply amazing. Herrera was offering options and moving the ball well unlike Torreira which made a big difference. Carrasco’s technical ability made us move down the channel way better. And Felix, fantastic passes as usual. If our players can finally finish these chances for God’s sake we will be so damn good.

Key takeaway for me is, if Saul is still unavailable then Herrera should start. He should be our 3rd choice CM not Torreira. Maybe he’s not enough to compete with Bayern, but he is good enough to help us in La Liga. 

We’re 2nd in La Liga with a game in hand now, things are looking right in direction! If we want to win the league then today is an example of what we need: no matter how poor we played, get the fucking 3 points. Hope we can maintain this form in LL and next UCL game as well, Aupa.",g9ya1qb,jhghcc,atletico,2020-10-25 05:09:30,1ngK,23

"I'm a Carrasco hater in general, but there is no denying he is absolutely crucial to this team now.

Carrasco would be the best player itw if he could finish,g9y8t0g,jhghcc,atletico,2020-10-25 05:01:26,Bihihem,9
"Super happy to see Atletico rise to 2nd place with only 5 games played, with an unbeaten record, least goals conceded, and the best goal difference with Sociedad in 2nd. Would've been first if Real Madrid hadn't won.
Greatly helps to get over the 4-0 trauma.

Finally, Atletico have improved their chance creation and overall game in attack, although there's still aspects to be desired. 

Defence was quite shaky in 1st half with way too many chances conceded. Betis actually put up a big fight, slightly dominating in the air and applied counter pressing to make passing difficult for Atleti. 
Defenders should just kick the ball out when pressured, instead of trying to toy with the attacker - that nearly cost us.

Fortunately, the defence and attack much improved in the 2nd half. It should have been 2-0 before the 90+ minute if only Carrasco took that 1v1 chance, but I'm glad that Luis Suarez scored another goal.
He hasn't been ""on fire"" per se, but he has been consistent so far.
Llorente looked like the MOTM to me - he was excellent in this match. 

The one piece of bad news is that Carrasco injury - we already have far too many players missing due to injury, we really can't afford any more. Hope it's nothing too serious so that he'll recover quickly.",g9yicer,jhghcc,atletico,2020-10-25 05:57:39,Strange_Quark_9,5
We could of had 4 honestly. Absolutely brilliant 2nd half. Clearly Cholo said something that was needed. We came out controlling midfield and started making runs. Joao should of had 2 assists.

"First half it felt so individualistic and the defenders and midfielders were not open at all, we kept playing baloonish meaningless long balls and we had ton of miss passes Torreira was struggling and Lemar was so individualistic who wanted to dribble from midfield but he had good through balls, he will be a very good player if he is more a team player.  Second half we played much better and the angle Llorente scored from is crazy. The way we played we were playing on the ground and we were playing very technical beautiful football. The defense was intact most of the game and Hermoso was surprisingly good at LB. Llorente Motm. We still have a problem also it was apparent in the Bayern game is we are so wasteful infront of goal especially Suarez and Carrasco. The first half we could have scored 2 and in the second half we could have scored at least 3 more.  
We still have a very long and condensed season to go. Next two games are too different as Salzburg play a very open attacking game and probably Osasuna after last year's 5-0 will play very defensively.",g9zk0ua,jhghcc,atletico,2020-10-25 09:47:16,mos1992,3

"It is a big defeat but honestly I don’t really feel mad or embarrassed. Bayern is just head and shoulders above every team in Europe rn. We aren’t even playing that bad if you ask me...ffs

This game highlights our poor depth and how bad we are in front of goal. Had we scored one or two from these good chances the game can be at least somewhat different. Meanwhile Bayern’s goals are hard to pull off yet they are clinical af, that makes a hell of different.

Also our depth is far from enough. It’s ok to deal with La Liga games, but not vs the biggest teams. When Saul is injured we only have Herrera to get outclassed, Josema absent and we are defending like a headless bird, and from Carrasco and Llorente to Vitolo and Lemar, the quality drop is too much.

"Feels humiliating, getting spanked like that. Although let's not act like this was out of all realms of possibility, since we are playing the best team in Europe right now.

Still no need to sugarcoat tonight's performance. Only half chances created, no end product in the final third. João again too little involved, getting muscled off the ball easily and giving the ball away carelessly while walking across the pitch not giving a fuck. Thomas left a big whole in that midfield, which is even further emphasized without Saúl. Dunno what we plan to do for those games when Torreira isn't playing.

Then again there's no time to look back on this game. The players need hold their heads high and focus on the super important games to come.",g9kxd5p,jfldbm,atletico,2020-10-22 04:59:37,IndioDelManzanares,6
"I mean, Bayern is a powerhouse right now so I expected this kind of result. Quick analysis:

- Suárez is just to put the ball in, we can't expect him to do more than that and it shouldn't be his job.
- Felix was better in the second half. It's quite hard to put him on talent mode yet, and was easily neutralized by Bayern.
- Herrera is godamn awful. Sorry my mexican friends I don't know what he needs. 
- Carrasco and Llorente looked lost, but Carrasco was better. 
- I get the feeling that if we don't go far this season Oblak will leave us next season. 

Aside from that, the first two goals were from mistakes from our players and the last two goals from were just pure talent, so I don't think we should take them too hard. We don't usually play Bayern so this will not be the norm. 

Also, Salzburg and Lokomotiv tied their match, we just need to focus on them and don't rely over the result against Bayern at home.

"In moments like these we have to analyze the game part by part and not by what the scoreline shows. Let's take this game as a collateral damage and move on. I think we started the game well and we actually almost scored and the game was balanced until they scored. Our defense did not have the best game and they were so disconnected with our midfielders. Our midfielders were caught between attacking or defending and I think Joao was the best player in the game again for us and I don't know why his goal did not stand as it did not touch Suarez but I won't whine about the officiating. Carrasco could have scored and Suarez had the early chance. I feel like we could have tried shooting from outside because I feel like we were trying to penetrate a very compact defense at the end of the game which made reaching the goal so difficult.

"Everytime you see Carrasco get the ball to Bayerns D, he just passes to Lodi who attempts a cross and gets shut down..
In my opinion, Lodi isn't good enough for attacks, I would much rather prefer Carrasco Pass the ball inside towards our strikers himself or to the midfield to increase our options..Also, he is one of our most dangerous players but really really needs to work on his finishing..he had a couple of good chances today where one he shot directly at Never and the other he hit the side net. Felix looks good on the ball and he created a couple of good chances.. but he needs to work on getting the ball to the oppositions net faster.. He doesn't have a lot of pace so he should work on his shooting from outside the box(he did finish a good chance for us). Hector isn't a first team player nor is he a starter..bring him in when its the 60th minute and our starting midfield isn't performing, otherwise he is just taking up the space for our creative players.. Llorente isn't suited for the RM or RW position, he should have played in place of Hector( He has a great workrate, can pass, has pace, and usually helps in maintaining possession) with Correa on the right( best position for him, with alot of pace).
Defensively, Lodi needs to be trained on crosses and tracking back faster..You can't leave Coman open like that(one of the fastest players in the world). And if we can't maintain the ball, bring on Torriera who is literally a CDM. Suarez didn't look active enough and can't get to the ball fast enough..he needs to start taking more shots from outside the box. He doesn't have that dribbling, pace or stamina anymore..

Not that bad of a game..just hope Cholo sees the same thing i see..
And if you think about it, next game they might also have Sane and Gnabry so I am looking forward to what changes we can make in that time..",g9l3z50,jfldbm,atletico,2020-10-22 05:52:04,iamtheone11111,3

"Bayern are the world's best right now and it didn't seem they even broke a sweat handing down a 4-nil spanking against supposedly one of the best defenses.

Our best chance was to somehow sneak in a 1-0 lead and hold on to dear life for the upset. Or a goalless or 1-all draw. 

When we went down 0-2, realistically, we're just not that kind of team that could rack up 2-3 goals to pull off a massive upset. Bayern got all the goals instead.",g9lak4x,jfldbm,atletico,2020-10-22 06:46:51,Benitelta,1

I am really not optimistic especially since we lost the last 3 meetings away from Madrid against Bundesliga sides. We only beat Bayern twice at home but all the away games and the final we were defeated as well. Tomorrow we need to not let Lewandowski or Muller get near the box and we should not concede corners because they are very good with it. Also we should not let Kimmich or any of their midfielders shoot from outside the box. Suarez and Joao will be vital tomorrow in counter attacks,g9im4ld,jf6eb4,atletico,2020-10-21 14:10:58,mos1992,8

"Some statistics : 

 * Aiming to win successive European honours for the first time since 1974/76, Bayern Munich begin their UEFA Champions League (UCL) defence with an average winning margin of 3.18 across 11 successive UCL wins. Meanwhile, a majority (four) of their last seven UCL victories have seen them open the scoring inside the first 15 minutes.


 * Encouragingly for Bayern, reigning holders of the day have won their first UCL home matchday in each of the last seven seasons, winning by an odd-numbered margin on six occasions. Over in the Bundesliga, meanwhile, Bayern have seen a majority (five) of their last nine home league wins produce over 2.5 total second-half goals.


 * If counting only the regulation 90 minutes in their extra-time win at Anfield in March, Atlético Madrid have in fact lost five of their last seven European away clashes - that excludes UCL results on neutral turf. All five of those 90-minute defeats saw them lose the first half 1-0, conceding the goal responsible for that within the 31st minute-HT period on four occasions.


 * With Atlético scoring a 64% majority of their La Liga (LL) away goals after HT since the start of 2019/20, the expectation of better action in the second-half is further underlined here.Furthermore, only three of their last 21 LL away matches have witnessed over 1.5 goals before HT.


 * Players to watch: Bayern hero Kingsley Coman was the cup winner in the 2020 UCL final. Half of his last six UCL goals have been match openers scored before HT.


 * Atlético midfielder João Félix scored three UCL goals last term, including two penalties and two decisive match openers.


 * Hot stat: Exactly half (12) out of 24 UEFA Champions League groups across the last three completed UCL seasons have seen both teams drawn from the top two pots progress to the Round of 16.",g9ipsyx,jf6eb4,atletico,2020-10-21 15:10:11,Ashitakaa,4

"Atletico's current form: in the last 3 games, they had 2 disappointing draws and one 2-0 win against Celta. From my analysis, Atletico have been struggling a lot with creativity in midfield. Since they are now perceived as a big team in La Liga, other teams treat them with respect and thus are happy to settle for a draw. As a result, this forces Atletico to try to play more attacking because the smaller teams often try to park the bus against them.
But the biggest problem with Atletico playing attacking football is that is that they are not familiar with, as they are a traditionally defensive team. As a result, they are like a fish out of the water when they try to play attacking. In consequence, their midfield struggles with linking up creative passes through the centre, and often instead over-rely on crossing or hoofing the ball upfield. Furthermore, their defence left quite a few holes due to trying to push upfield and press their opponents, that their opponents exploited, and were only saved by Oblak.
I can only hope that Torreira can help with creativity in midfield - so far, he's been in good form and contributed to the team.

Atletico will also be missing some key players: Costa, Gimenez, Saúl and Vrsaljko (hope I spelled his name correctly).

Bayern's current form: they suffered an embarrassing defeat to Hoffenheim mainly due to player fatigue after the Supercup match, and the lack of squad depth to replace those fatigued players. But they have acquired new players since then to solve this problem for the future. Hence, they won all other league matches ever since. They play very good attacking, high-pressing, dominant football which proves effective at breaking down defences of smaller teams.

But they will also be missing some key players: Sané and Gnabry are the ones I can think of.

Overall, Bayern will inevitably play high-pressing football. Some people fear utter destruction from them. However, their attacking style will mean that Atletico will have to play the style they most excel at: defensive, counter-attacking football. If those conceded chances in league matches were mainly due to them trying to press forward, then they should be able to handle the pressure from Bayern when they play defensively. 
The biggest reason why Barça got destroyed by Bayern is because they should have pushed back and defend after Bayern were dominating the midfield, but they didn't, because Barça plays dominant possession-based tiki-taka - defensive football is just not their style, just how attacking football is not Atletico's style.

Thus, I do not expect a win, but under Bayern's attacking football, Atletico thrives under defensive, counter-attacking football.
I therefore do not fear annihilation, but just a marginal defeat.",g9k4tip,jf6eb4,atletico,2020-10-22 01:12:34,Resident-Tackle-2606,2

On the bright side, Torreira fits in like he's playing for us long ago lol. I like how he covers the pitch, but still we can't see him as Thomas' direct replacement as he lacks a bit on progressing the ball and offensive sense. Lemar played well today too, progress the ball and making switches, would love to see more of him.

"Maybe I haven't been reading in the right places (like r/soccer apparently, but idk why you'd expect anything else from there or somewhere like Twitter) but I don't see how Atleti has been humiliated.

And as for blaming the club for not renewing his contract - they can only do that if Thomas wanted to stay, and while he never seemed to outwardly push to leave the club, there was plenty done by members of his entourage/agents to suggest he would easily leave the club.  He reportedly turned down numerous offers to double his salary (and maybe even more depending on which sources you believe for what his salary was and what was offered) - although this turned out well for him as he is now reportedly on 4 times what he was on with us.  FWIW his reported salary now with Arsenal would be the 4th highest salary at Atletico Madrid (Oblak, Koke and the overpaid Diego Costa being the only ones who earn more).",g7wssxy,j5ut0e,atletico,2020-10-07 00:55:33,drd_23,1

"Even though I won’t understand he goes to Arsenal over us, I don’t blame Thomas for wanting to leave, as he always seemed to be valued behind the 3. 

But it isn’t a good way to leave without even letting us know. He could’ve told Simeone about this early on so we can make a plan, instead he simply leaves at last minute and screwed us.",g7uuzgo,j5suxo,atletico,2020-10-06 10:14:43,1ngK,2
"That Thomas left without a warning is bogus. We all know this has been a soap opera for months and months. The release clause was quite small and Arsenal finally blinked on paying it in full. But that was always a possibility because Partey didn't get the substantial raise he deserved that another team was willing to give him. 

Many thanks for his years of service, including being relatively underpaid while other less deserving were getting big contracts left and right. He will be a terrific fit in Arteta's Arsenal and I wish Thomas well. 

Meanwhile, Torreira (welcome!) is not a complete replacement but he is a Simeone kind of player. With Torreira, Saul, Koke, Herrera staying, even Llorente sometimes if he's not wide or up front, we have options in the middle. As long as we can maintain that solid double pivot in our system, I'd like the attacking mind-set this season to continue so I think improving our wing/wide MF play to  complement our strikers is arguably more important. We'll have to hope for internal improvement on that as it stands.

So long, Thomas Partey, you'll clearly be a loss, and also thank you and good luck. At the end of the day, this team will be alright.",g7vpton,j5suxo,atletico,2020-10-06 17:48:31,Benitelta,2

Carrasco has been strong, but we can't rely on only one player.

"I'm assuming the rumor is true, given that multiple reliable reporters are saying the same thing.

Thomas joined the club when he was 18 but you’d think he walked in off the street last week, the way this club has treated him. The board wouldn’t pay him anything close to what he’s worth. It took two full seasons of great play for him to nail down his spot, and even then, Cholo still occasionally made it clear he was third choice behind Koke and Saúl. If Atleti knew what they had in him, they certainly didn’t show it. I don’t blame him at all for leaving.

Now this team has the midfield it deserves: no joy or creativity, just well-drilled foot soldiers back-passing or hitting it long. I’m glad we’re heading into an international break, because I don’t want to watch or think about Atleti for a while.

The performance improved a little bit in the second half. Huesca did great with what they have and could have scored on the counter  but thanks to Felipe, who played a very good game, we didn;t. Hermoso was not bad and I liked that he pushed towards the midfield. Lodi did not have the best of games in regards to crossing and did not link well with Vitolo. Vitolo only performs when he is subbed in and there are a lot of players like that which does not mean he is a bad player but he is a bad starter. Llorente was chocked by the defense and it was not his game anyway. Trippier played well and I think Joao was MOTM in my opinion. Suarez did not receive anything really except the golden chance he should have tried to put in quickly and Diego Costa fumbled the Correa great pass which we needed. Thomas was ok and Saul was solid.   
It is too early to cry and whine about not performing in a game or go to the seventh heaven like after the Granada game. We just need to improve offensively against away games.",g78705r,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 06:28:40,mos1992,3

"What I noticed, and this could only be me, was the lack of communication. This isn’t new either, you could see cholo screaming his lungs out in frustration because no one is listening to his commmands, and Suarez was also trying to help by suggesting passes to the rest of the squad to try and create a play only for them to pass the ball back. This is incredible frustrating to see and until proper communication is being used there will always be disorganization in the team.",g77f6nv,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 03:13:17,baby-slash,3
"Hindsight is 20/20 but costa should  have started Suarez hasn’t got 60mins of energy on him yet, his preseason has been nonexistent and he has no connection to his teammates yet. agaisn a tired defense he’ll have much more of an impact.

 Vitolo is so slow with the ball on his feet everytime the ball reached him the Huesca defense could reset and fix their positioning. Until felix started doing quick passes with either Corres, Koke or Carrasco, there was no danger.

Lodi was also really bad today.",g77lzsc,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 03:53:11,nanook9,3
"Carrasco's pace and dribbling has become so important in the attack. How sorely he was missed in the first half when the game was more open and Vitolo was instead a waste in his place. Vitolo starting was a game-changer in such a negative way. Cholo put his faith in him and oh how he failed. Not the only problem, also badly missed chances and Lodi's wild crosses, , but something that stood out.",g78g862,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 08:00:32,Benitelta,3

"A game of frustration, and same old away game shit form.

Don’t have the mood to review every players, but I want to leave some key takeaways here.

First thing, Vitolo should not start again until he proves what he can offer to the team. It’s too risky to have him starting, which basically brought nothing to our game today.

Second, Koke needs to start. No words needed for this I guess, without him we are such a mess.

Third, Carrasco should start as much as possible, with Llorente as a super sub. Carrasco is so good both on the ball and organising attacks, he should start and make Llorente coming late to utilise his impact. 

Not gonna blame Suarez entirely for this loss, but that ball from Felix was the 3 points for us. He shouldn’t miss that. 

On the bright side, at least Felix is feeling it and almost led us to a win singlehandedly. He is the one to count on for the whole season.

Don’t want to blame too much on our team, Huesca literally threw 10 men in the box and blocking everything with head counts. We had good chances, we were really close, and we should keep playing in an offensive way. I just hope Simeone doesn’t give up and continue working on breaking down tight defences and figure out how to get these wins against smaller teams.

Next match is a big one, Villarreal. Hope we can fix the flaws and win it. Aupa Atleti",g77dzrd,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 03:05:35,1ngK,4
"damn. we needed Carrasco on earlier. don't think vitolo should start, still best as an impact sub. correa/carrasco are needed to help break down these kind of defence.

"This is getting super old.

Way too many moments like this: we're moving forward. We could play a risky final ball and we're getting pressed. We cycle the ball back to the center backs. The defense sets up. The ball gets back to midfield and ultimately is wasted on a pass from a much worse attacking position, because the opponent had time to solidfy. The other team gets possession.

I get that doing this leaves the team less exposed at the back, but if you're going to do this, you might as well actually try to play with more possession and patience overall, rather than play mediocre passes from midfield and crosses that don't go anywhere.

I'm very glad we picked up a few new players, because we have so so much room for improvement.",g77dp4l,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 03:03:37,[deleted],2
"When was younger and did something bad my parents  would tell me "" How would you feel if somebody did that to you?"". Well today I found the answer. Bad.

"Last game we literally had the perfect starting lineup as well as perfect subs.. taking in the fact the subs last game aren't exactly on that level of the starters ( except for Partey and Suarez but Suarez needs some time to adjust). Just cause those subs had a great impact in the final 30 minutes doesnt mean that they can have the same impact in the first 60 when opposition players arent tired.. Also, llorente has proven to be a great player when playing centrally as a CAM or a second striker so playing him on the wing isn't a smart move.. if we saw some nice chemistry between felix and costa last Match, we saw the same with Llorente and suarez.. and llorente also becomes God like when he is a supersub as his speed is unmatched at that time.. botu Carrasco and correa are important for us on the wings..we need to have them matchfit for every game as starters because vitolo is clearly not good enough as a starter and neither is llorente on the wing..
Its nice that we had this match so early on in the season so that cholo can see where the squad actually lacks and hopefully can make the necessary improvements..",g79nnl8,j2s67f,atletico,2020-10-01 16:29:48,iamtheone11111,1

"WE DID IT BOYS!!!!A win away vs Valencia is good enough. Hats off to Valencia tbh they played a good game, but we applied enough pressure for them to withstand.

Happy to see Lemar getting the MOTM tbh, he deserves it. He created most of the danger and  could've bagged us one or two. Wanted to see more of him but anyway. Hope he will continue this form because I still think he can be a valuable asset for us.

And, Carrasco simply won us two games in a row. Love this man.

Btw Lodi is the one to note. I feel like his situation now is very awkward as we are preferring the 3 atb formation with two wingbacks. He really need to step up his game, no starting place is guaranteed for him. 

One thing concerns me is again, set pieces. We had like 30 set pieces in the past two games I guess, but we just can't take advantage off it. Please practice it, in such games we definitely need to provide more threats in set pieces for more opportunities. 

Need to make better decisions too, sometimes we got ourselves in a good position but always took extra touches or passes for nothing.

Hope Suarez can return ahead of next game vs Bayern. Crucial game, can't afford to lose.

Lemar is good today, one of our most dangerous player despite his miss on that big chance.

Felix and Llorente desperately need a no 9 to combine, hopefully Suarez can come back soon enough.

Next on to Bayern game.",gdw5n2k,k2raiq,atletico,2020-11-29 01:11:00,rainsong94,28
"I don't feel too bad about the own goal because it felt inevitable as our pressure kept mounting. 

We are also adjusting from defending in two banks of four to what we're using now. It isn't urgent as the change isn't permanent but I hope we sort it out in future. I feel like the change in shape, though it's circumstantial and temporary has really affected some player's performance. IMO,

Players (+) affected: 

1. **Trippier** at least offensively as he becomes much more involved and plays much further forward 

2. **Lemar** is playing more centrally and is surrounded by more passing options

3. **Hermoso** is just a boss at LCB

4. **Carrasco** thriving at LWB is not something I expected. I know he's played it for Belgium before but that was a while ago. He can be caught out of position but honestly just doesn't stop running.

Players (-) affected: 

1. **Llorente** has less of an impact offensively since now he makes his runs from more central positions going wide instead of his usual inverted runs

2. **Savic** honestly looks vulnerable to being pressed, we were pressed more in our right flank especially since Saul came off and Koke went left. I'm curious how Felipe will look in future games playing that role.

Some random thoughts: 

• I'm happy that Lemar seems happy and has a role again.

• I am convinced Saponjic doesn't actually exist.

• Koke finding his form is huge and he is completely undroppable, the absolute backbone of our entire team.

• Kondogbia's role going forward became more apparent in this game imo. It seems that he's playing more of a Koke/Saul role rather than a 1-for-1 Thomas replacement; the way he pressed and how deep he dropped convinced me. He was clearly still feeling out how his new teammates move and misplaced some easy passes. His workrate is great though.

• I get that João and Llorente are passionate but they need to learn to cool their heads. Those were silly bookings that they picked and they can be costly in a title chase.",gdw95x0,k2raiq,atletico,2020-11-29 01:33:29,herro_preeeze,11
"I think this win was thoroughly deserved. We played great. Felix still needs more rest though and we need Suarez back. Hard-fought, but a victory is a victory.",gdw5s7x,k2raiq,atletico,2020-11-29 01:11:52,atmsmbk,10
"It's not the perfect match I imagined, and it's an ugly goal, but I'll take it. We worked very hard, pressed well; also glad Lemar was MOTM. He really showed good energy and inventive passes out there.

Although I really have to say for most of the match we were taking one pass too much when we're in the final third. It seems as though everyone wants to score a goal, but also, everyone hesitates to do so. But a win is a win. This just really shows that we are really dependent on a true no. 9.

"3 points is 3 points no matter how you get it so I'll take it. Lemar looked good and confident today which is something we rarely see, hope he keeps this up. A small shoutout to Trippier who is still just chugging along match after match. 

Having no striker is still killing us and we need Suarez back soon or else our season can really be derailed here in these couple of weeks. I think loaning in a sub striker is also something we have to do this winter. Maybe Giroud even though I'm not his biggest fan if he's willing to be a sub who will get a decent amount of minutes since Suarez won't always play and we have a decent relationship with Chelsea.",gdw6vs0,k2raiq,atletico,2020-11-29 01:18:49,ForgetHype,7

Today we saw different tactics and we took a very big risk and it payed off. The best players for me were Lemar and Carrasco and the rest were good as well. In the second half Valencia were invisible offensively but very strong defensively. The only player we really need is a dynamic striker who is a finisher in front of goal. Probably next game against Bayern they will have most possession and we will drop back not like today but it is nice to see the variation in the tactics of the team.,gdwkvcm,k2raiq,atletico,2020-11-29 02:41:22,mos1992,3

"I think we NEEDED Costa and WANTED Suarez in this match. 
The amount of corners and crosses we had, a big man like Costa who is great at headers would have come up with a goal or two, causing Lokomotiv to open up more..
But alas, it wasn't meant to be..

I think another issue is that we play far better when we attack from the right side instead of the left as Trippier and Llorente make a great combo but for whatever reason, whenever Lodi plays, we seem to constantly attack from the left..where I dont think Lodi is even that good at crosses and neither is Carrasco..Heck, I say we have found our starting LB in Hermoso and Lodi can be the sub to bring in some extra energy in the final 20-25min..

EDIT: Also would add that Lemar looked really good today for the time he played, but for gods sake, keep this man as far away from corners as possible..I've yet to see him actually cross a ball from a corner to any of our players which is weird af since his normal ingame were pretty good..he either lofts it too much that it goes over everyone or too little that it can't make it past the first defender..I think that's why Felix started taking them after Lemar wasted a couple..",gdljf4v,k11swl,atletico,2020-11-26 06:10:18,iamtheone11111,16

We needed Suarez or Costa for this one, not because of the goals but because they move defenders and could've left more space for Carrasco, LLorente and Joao. Correa is good but he doesn't move defenders. 

Welp, good match (in the sense that we tried with all we got), awful result. Valencia incoming so let's move to that.

"We’re so bad against a low block. Without a striker the crosses go to nowhere, yet we never tried through middle.

Chances were there, we are so damn unlucky to not even score one tbh. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do better, we’re expected to beat them and when we couldn’t, it’s undoubtedly a failure.

Don’t wanna sound too harsh but Felix was awful. Carrasco, Correa and Llorente all did a decent job, but Felix was pretty much invisible as a F9. No movement from him to even imagine he will score. He’s probably tired but anyway.

And when playing against such defensive side, one thing to break them down is set pieces. We’re incredibly bad at it. We only scored 1 from set pieces this season iirc, and we need to improve them badly to help us breaking down these teams. It’s either being punished for fouls or the delivery never reached the players.

When playing without striker it’s hard to see player getting to the end of chances, thus we need a lot of movements from the frontline to create it. We’re lacking it a lot today. You can’t just create them, someone got to be on the receiving end. There’s a reason to witness such frustrating display. I mean literally no attacker is going to fight for the end of the chances, of course we did no shit. Doesn’t help that we had to cross a lot today and no one seems to be gonna score with their head.

So now, we can’t really afford to lose against Bayern now. Hell, the next two games are hard. I hope we can get through this group, and it’s important to have both strikers back asap.

"Idk if anyone said it but I have to give props to Simeone for a few things. First and the most obvious is for sticking to what they’ve done all year which is playing with 4 players attacking rather than the usual 3. 
Second for being more aggressive and wanting the ball more than usual (Barça always has 60-70% of possession against us, today only 55).

Third and the most important. Benching Lodi in favor of Hermoso. And before I get killed by some here, let me explain. Lodi as good as he is, when he charges forward he doesn’t recover well defensively and play develops behind him more often than not. The same happens with Trippier, hence the Bayern Game, which was painful to watch. Now, with hermoso playing as a “Left Back” Altetico really changes to a 3-4-2-1 or 3-5-2, with Whomever plays as a LM really playing as a wingback and trippier as a right wingback. This allows the wingbacks to charge forward and are covered defensively. Carrasco makes it work better (as Saul was the one on that position last game) because of his pace which allows him to charge forward on attack and provide HELP defensively, rather than being the primary defender of the left flank.",gd5urmt,jyjeym,atletico,2020-11-22 12:43:45,poptony3,10

"What makes me happy is how we managed to get the best from the players that at one point looked completely lost in our team. Llorente is now a world class attacker, Hermoso shines at LB position and even Lemar looks completely different compared to the one point of the last season, where he looked like a guy who doesn't even want to play anymore.

"First win against barca in 10 years in La Liga, 24 games unbeaten, we have a young squad and our rivals except La Real have all dropped points. Hermoso was able to contain Dembele mostly, Messi and the rat were invisible most of the game. I liked that we played our game offensively as we play against any other opposition. Carrasco was the Goat as usual in barca games and everyone played well including the subs. The only think to take care of are aerial headers and crosses.

"Well it was quite an easy game, unexpectedly. Thought Barca would play better than this, but perhaps it was us completely outclassing them haha.

Carrasco has a fantastic match, and it’s just his first game back from injury! He’s so important to us. Correa did well too, 6 assists already this season. And honestly, Lemar has been looking really good this season with the minutes given. 

Everyone did a wonderful job. Defense, midfield, attack, we are better in every ways. We aren’t even that good, there was so many opportunities for us to finish the game but our crosses came too slow. Anyway it doesn’t matter, 3 points are what we need.

Top of La Liga with 2 games in hand. First 1-0 win. AND Real and Villarreal just dropped points. Fantastic. It’s our league to lose now, we have to keep delivering these good performances.

"Best comment from the Barca thread:

I don’t get why people are panicking. I mean sure, we’re in 10th place. Sure, our manager who has sucked at most of us his jobs sucks at this one as well. Sure, our club has looked awful since Valencia a year and a half ago. Sure, there’s rumors the club is going to go bankrupt. Sure, the best player of all time wants to leave. Sure, we have three 100million + Euro players and none of them are even adequate starters. But there’s no reason to panic.",gd4fj8g,jyhdwe,atletico,2020-11-22 06:45:41,Raised_via_chancla,12

"We are really lacking a central player to pass the ball to. If Costa is fit, I  wouldn't mind him playing if he is fit. It would take the pressure away from Felix and attract players with his runs for Llorente/Carrasco/Felix to do more.",gd3ryhx,jyhdwe,atletico,2020-11-22 04:24:10,atmsmbk,2

"[According to Mundo Deportivo](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/atletico-madrid/20201120/49549025682/simeone-muestra-sus-cartas-ante-el-barca-y-son-ofensivas.html), Simeone used this starting midfield and attack during the training sessions: Koke, Saúl, Correa, Llorente, Carrasco and João",gcxuaik,jxoor8,atletico,2020-11-20 21:43:44,carpetano,27
"It’s going to tough for both sides. I agree that Barcelona are coming into this with a weaker defense with our fast paced attack being able to definitely get past them, especially with Koeman opting for a three at the back formation. However, Barcelona are also Barcelona. 

They will not give up until the end of the match. I just hope our team can edge them out. And do so before the 89th minute. If we can beat this team, we could be going into the rest of the season with our heads high and confidence at an all time high. We will use that confidante against lokomotiv in our next UCL team, and we will use it for the rest of the difficult fixtures for a while. My only wish is to not loose by humiliation. If we loose to an embarrassing scorline, it could drastically alter our confidence for the rest of the seasons.

Nonetheless I’m excited. A true test for our mighty on form team. Maybe Joao will bag his first hatrick. I wouldn’t be opposed to that. My prediction is 2-1 Atletico. AUPA ATLETI",gcyabof,jxoor8,atletico,2020-11-21 00:10:32,AtleticoFan17,16

"With the number of players we have out in the same position it's key that we get a lead before we have to make any subs either due to fatigue or injuries. 

While it sucks losing Suarez for this match I don't think it's the biggest loss we could have had, we played without a true 9 before and in that match it took us a while to get used playing without a true reference point up front but in the second half we really turned it on.

We're going to have a lot of speed and we have to attack them as often as possible to put pressure on their backline. But when we're getting the ball out of our half we have to make sure that we get the ball to our forwards in a position where they can dribble right away since we won't have someone who can hold up the ball and pass it to our forwards when they're in a better spot to go.

I wouldn't be surprised to see us sit back in the first 15 minutes or so to gauge how well they can break us down and if they show that they aren't going to be able to create anything against us then it could play into our favor since Barca can't handle any type of counterattack let alone one from Felix, Llorente and Correa all in great form.

I do hope that we do go all out and really smack Barca this match, a big win could not only give us a ton of confidence but also bascially break Barca. Winning here doesn't mean we win the league but if Barca loses I think that means the league is gone for them.",gcyes9c,jxoor8,atletico,2020-11-21 00:46:09,ForgetHype,6

"It is the toughest opposition for us in La Liga since it has been more than 10 years since we beat them in La Liga or the CDR. We need to stop Messi, Coutinho and Dembele especially shooting from outside and passing in between defenders, because this is how Messi scored two of his goals from open play against us last year, and at the same time exploit their defense like we did last year in the Camp as it did not get stronger. Last year we played a very good first game in the Metropolitano against them and we lost then we almost won the second one in the Camp if only we took our chances. We just need to play like the last few games and we should be able to win.",gcznvqh,jxoor8,atletico,2020-11-21 06:57:16,mos1992,2

Dybala is a great great player who when you use him right is one of the best attackers out there but to use him right we would have to push aside Felix which makes no sense to do. 

If we didn't have Felix and we were still trying to fill in that Griezmann spot we would be all over this but again we have Felix now and invested into his future.

"No offense to him if he does come in, but I dont think Dybala is the player that we need..and if Morata continues his amazing form throughout the season, we should definitely rather have him back. Dybala I feel like is already in a team which was built around him but he had to make room for Ronaldo so got pushed around here and there until he seemingly doesn't have a fit in his team anymore.. and if he does come to Atleti, he would get the same treatment as Felix and Llorente would be given his position more than him..
First season Morata is an amazing Morata..and if we get him back, he will again be giving a first season performance for us..and I've seen his goals, he has improved alot maybe due to fierce competition with Ronaldo..he also looks to have learnt a thing or two new.. and the balls he recieve in Juventus are lesser quality to those of Felix and Co..

We dominated and created good chances, unfortunately their keeper had such a good game. 

Suarez was so bad though. The mistake to me is taking out Correa who was having a good game. Had he stayed longer maybe we could’ve created more.

At least, I like how we doing and if we can keep this system clicks even better, there shouldn’t be any doubt that we will do good this season. Yes we should’ve created more, but today we showed good effort going forward, and I believe we can still qualify with ease if we play better in the following games vs Lokomotiv and Salzburg.

I cannot fathom us drawing to them. They are sooo clearly the lesser side here. We DOMINATED them in every single aspect of this game.

Morata probably can net one or two goal for us today but the ship has sailed, he's playing well for Juve currently. A quick and young striker in winter transfer window will be a great addition.

Most positive take away from this match is how the whole team is still trying to score till the end. They got more sloppy towards the end probably because of fatigue. It's just not our day.",gb1d14v,jnhd1o,atletico,2020-11-04 03:50:40,rainsong94,2

We started the game good and overall the performance was great offensively and kind of untested defensively. We have a major problem which is create chances when the other team are playing very defensive. Joao played a masterful game and got close a couple of times and Suarez and a lot of the players missed a lot of chances. There were also a couple of chances to shoot for Herrera and Lemar but they are playing as if they have instructions not to shoot from outside the box. We will face a similar team next weekend against Cadiz but I hope we can take our chances this time and watch for quick counters,gb1fko8,jnhd1o,atletico,2020-11-04 04:10:57,mos1992,1

"22 games unbeaten in LL, 2nd most goals scored and the best defence with a game in hand. Guys, we are actually GOOD right now!

I thought today would be rather a unconvincing win since we rotated quite a lot, but they proved me wrong. We created a ton of chances, and scored 3 goals without even a striker. The only criticism is, we should score way more though...

Koke is fantastic, how he still doesn’t have an assist yet is beyond me, he spoon fed Vitolo and Correa but...ya. Joao had rather a quiet game but still bagged two goals. Correa had some bad misses but his overall game has been good, with a nice assist to top it off. Didn’t expect much from Vitolo but man did a good job today. Happy for Torreira’s first goal for us as well, what a goal!

Keep this form, then I really see us bagging some trophies this season. Well, if we can finish our chances maybe we can sweep domestic trophies tbh. I have to say, our games this season has been so much fun to watch. Aupa Atleti, looking forward for the UCL game!",gaq4v42,jlodjq,atletico,2020-11-01 03:33:01,1ngK,39

"Another grind, another win. Correa despite his horrible miss is playing good and very unlucky today, one shot hitting a post and another one on one with good save from the keeper. Felix continue his goalscoring form, while Tripps despite clearly looking very exhausted still giving his all.

Shame that we conceded one but it's a great cross and header tbf, Savic probably should do better on that one.

What I can't understand is why Simeone waiting until 80th min marks to do his sub. Either it's to rest his bench to prepare for Lokomotiv, or he doesn't trust his bench. Most likely the former IMO.",gaq445h,jlodjq,atletico,2020-11-01 03:26:05,rainsong94,19

The attackers were trying to find a striker but there was none who did this role. At the end when we started playing and dribbling through the defenders we got the penalty and scored. Second half we should have scored at least 4 more. Joao missed a penalty, Correa was selfish and missed a couple of times, Vitolo went full Vitolo and was kind of miss passing. Also the substitutions were too late. Joao again the star and scores again. The defense was intact all game except the Gallego chance at the beginning and the goal as it was wrong coverage by Savic. Great goal by Torreira from a very tight angle. Next game Lokomotiv will be difficult as they improved from last year and in La Liga Cadiz will be very difficult as they have won all of their away games.

Savic was a beast, but he is too error prone and frankly, we could've seen a clean sheet. Second half onwards we literally controlled the game. It was good to see one touch football and finally some composure on the ball. We created an awful lot of chances, that should've been converted. But I'm glad Felix scored a brace - much needed for him and us. Koke was sublime. His no look through balls was almost ASMR. SOMEONE RECALL HIM TO THE SPAIN'S PLAYING 11 ASAP. Vitolo imo was great. He didn't score or get assists, but just look at his entire match - marauding into the penalty area, keeping possession and making key passes - for someone who is struggling for play time, this was a great performance.

"Get mandzukic in on a free for 1.5 year contract as a backup option which Costa was currently..Pay him half the wages Costa got..Time for Simieone and him to put aside their differences..He shouldn't be too mad at the paycut as he isn't playing anywhere and might be his last chance to earn some money playing..


Wait for the summer to sign some great Attacking talent that will emerge from this season..Or maybe pay Haaland's release clause..?? 

Another option is we try to recall Morata..if we get him, great..if we don't, (most probably not as Juventus is in a slump of late) we can at least try to get some money out of them (although would be difficult since I dont think this goes well with the terms of the contract and they'd rather spend the money fixing their own problems ryt now) or just pay up for Milik who has been linked with us for a while.. If Cholo thinks he is the one, then I belive in Cholo..

Some players i'd recommend:

Andre Silva from E. FRANKFURT, he just signed with them this season on a 3miliion fees but we could probably get him for around 30 million, same as Milik..Hes Portuguese so could link up well with felix, also being an absolute beast right now with 9 goals in 12 bundesliga games..

Boulaye Dia from Riems.. hes scored 10 in 15 matches and plays as a 9 for them while being 24 years old..his contract ends in 1.5 years, and is valued at 8million by tranfermarkt..He could potentially be willing to play as our second choice due to his age and we can ease him in to the squad till hes ready.. 

Yousef poulsen from RB Leipzig,  been a fan of his for sometime. 26 years old marketed at 25million..

Out of all these players, I'd honestly prefer Milik and then Andre Silva as both are great players..Milik might be the cheaper option since he's forcing a move which also shows that he wants to play somewhere else, and would be willing to work hard for us..

"This is fucking ridiculous. A global football ban? Goddammit! There has to be some kind of an appeal from the club because the English FA dictating whether or not someone can participate in other competitions is ridiculous.

Also, what the fuck, Kieran? Why? What's the point man? You are already making a fuckton of money playing football. Is there really a need to fuck around and risk your reputation and playing career for a little extra money?

I just hope Vrsaljko can stay healthy and fill in right away for Trippier. We won't see the same kind of technical abilities but Vrsaljko can offer something different if he stays healthy.

Edit: Some people on r/coys and r/soccer are saying that this could be as innocuous as Trippier telling his friends/family that he is going to be moving to Atletico and then his friends/family going on to place bets based on that ""insider"" information. Please don't be like me and cast too harsh of a judgment based on this ruling by the FA.

Trippier has been having IMO his best professional season so far. He’s been utterly amazing for us. Keeping fit, and playing every minute of this season minus the Cup games. 

His link up play and positioning is something that Vrsalko simply isn’t technically gifted at. Trippier is one of my favorite Atletico players and this sucks fucking big time. 

While at times he’s had some bad games but everybody does. But his recent form since the Bayern game has been great. Watching him and Llorente link up on a game basis is amazing. I just hold this gets repealed. This is huge.",ggu1eav,kit8eg,atletico,2020-12-24 05:15:10,AtleticoFan17,6

"(copied from another sub) 

Few things:

Llorente redemption arc completed. His fall started in this exact fixture last year, he put in a shambolic performance that saw him frozen out of the team, Simeone had completely lost trust in him and he looked like his time at Atletico was limited. Fast forward a year and he's a nailed-on starter as one of the most in-form forwards in the league (arguably Europe) where he's wrangled the midfield and scored. Marvelous story.

Another thing, the entire team did so amazing. Trippier's consistency is remarkable considering he's played a full 90 in every game except in the Copa del Rey. He's got himself a strong campaign for best RB in the league. Suarez does one or two big moves all match, but it almost always results in a goal, I'm loving Suarez in Atleti colors. It's also a fun thing to watch Suarez try to be a cultured forward with his runs and passes and then Costa comes on in the 80th minute, commits about 5 fouls in 10 minutes and completely disrupts their rhythm. Regardless, the professional job was great to see, La Real (bar Silva) were getting very frustrated and fidgety on the ball and it worked against them. Silva is amazing btw, City should've extended him.

Btw, I'm convinced Simeone has special juice he feeds his CDMs. Kondogbia's forward passing was amazing, his ball-winning was exquisite. He has a closet of Thomas Partey templates that he feeds his CDMs, even back when Augusto Fernandez was playing for us he went from a generic ball-winner to a total war horse in a matter of months.

That on top of a clean sheet against most teams.",ggq9sla,kidhr0,atletico,2020-12-23 05:04:48,Benitelta,5
There are good signs that the Simeone project from last year is starting to take shape and now we are playing very confidently against tough to beat away sides. The defense today was disciplined and dealt with all the danger in time. In the first half we were kind of aloof offensively but the second half we opened up our attacking power and it was nice to score with a set piece again. If anything we want to take from the old Simeone system in 2014 are set piece goals. I am also glad Llorente and Lemar are adapting to their new positions. The expression on Suarez's face tells all when he was subbed and that he expected more from himself. If all the players have this attitude we will have good days ahead. I am glad we will have the weekend off then we can prepare for the derby against Getafe.,ggrdqzc,kidhr0,atletico,2020-12-23 10:59:20,mos1992,5

Great game against a team which sat back. We were in control of most game except after we scored the second goal we relaxed. The goal we conceded from a corner is a copy of last week's goal and this is not good if it is a repeated pattern but I liked the response to the goal we conceded and we woke up again. Next game against La Real is very important and we need to not repeat last year's errors against them,ggfdso2,kg940q,atletico,2020-12-20 09:14:11,mos1992,4
"Why do people think that shouldn’t have been a pen? It was a high kick that hit Costa in the arm. Had his arm not been there he very well might have eaten a boot.

"Am I watching old re-runs or something? Everyone seems to talk about how Lemar is now the greatest player they've seen. What about his inability to make a pass within 30 meters of someone making a run? He missed Suarez 3 times today on some attacks with great potential. And what about the 297497246 times a game he gives the ball away? Or what about  when there's momentum heading forward and he does his trademark half spin only to pass it to the defense? Seriously I am genuinely concerned for anyone saying he's good now. All of that and I haven't touched on the fact that the man couldn't finish a puzzle if there was only one piece left, let alone a ball in front of goal.",ggebauh,kg940q,atletico,2020-12-20 04:39:52,alobank13,-9

"What I  love about Cholo as a human but find is a weakness in his managerial game is that he will do whatever it takes to play the players he trusts the most. This season he really trusts Llorente and Hermoso, so tries to play them every game. I thought Kondogbia had a really great game in the CDR and is a good candidate for the pivot alongside Koke for this match, but he has opted for Llorente. Llorente is probably my favorite player this season but I also like to see other players getting good playtime and playing well. idk. However, I do agree it is a good call to reward Lemar.

"Vitolo leaving is good news for everyone. He may be an okay player capable of slowing down a game if you need it, but he has such high wages for his contribution that moving on from him if possible is a no brainer. As for him, he has almost no chances here with basically everyone ahead of him in the rotation so getting again playing time will be good for him. He is 31, so not the youngest but he isnt that old either to be riding the bench as hard as he is doing and been doing for some years now",gg99krz,kfmmqx,atletico,2020-12-18 23:15:31,JNaran94,39

"Vitolo has a lot of talent, and he may work hard in that he's determined and willing to run, but he's totally apathetic towards football nowadays. He doesn't really care anymore, and it's realistically over for him, at this point. He loves living in Madrid, he loves raising his family in Madrid, he does the bare minimum to justify staying and is perfectly happy whether or not he plays. I don't blame him for that, but on the sporting side, it's a hit to have a player like that. I'd much rather prefer we get a striker in his place.",gga45v5,kfmmqx,atletico,2020-12-19 02:58:39,RoadsterIsHere,6
"This is clearly for the best mutually, but I can't help but feel sad for Vitolo. His confidence is pretty much gone and anytime he gets time on the pitch to build momentum he gets hurt.

"It seriously should be a no brainer to see Kondogbia starting on bigger matches. He even seemed like too much for this one and that was awesome. 

Great party from our right-backs and a great goal from Lemar. Grbic didn't had much but looked secure. Torreira failed a little too much with his passes and Vitolo kept being himself. Lodi played comfortably on his side and... about Sapa... he's fast, but probably Cholo doesn't use him for his positioning.",gg2ba3a,kegex2,atletico,2020-12-17 03:55:47,FrkM,26

"If this game can tell us anything, Kongdobia is a clear first-team player in that LCM position. Lemar, Torreira and Richard should both be our rotational players,  Sapo has to be used he was decent for the time he had but if you really think about it. That was his 4th game for us, I'm pretty sure he has started only one game. He'd be great to replace Suarez late in games.",gg2c7w8,kegex2,atletico,2020-12-17 04:03:06,Cholismo2pt0,3

"Chelsea fan here. If you've got any questions about our team you can ask me.
If I were to simply put it... I'm not confident at all. Your team is the worst possible matchup for us Our defense is solid but.. well Lampard has some starting 11 problems. Mount no longer plays on the wings but Kai Havertz is a CAM so sometimes we have to slightly change our team to fit him cos we dont normally play CAM formations. Since comign from Covid Havertz has somewhat struggled. I feel like Frank won't drop him but I hope he does. We have a lot of players so its easy for him to pick the wrong players. 

You guys tend to defend a lot so I'm not sure if we should play Werner. He's mainly played on the wings so I don't know how effective he would be as a striker against you lot. Even then he's a player that relies on spacs to play, although once or twice hes come up with magical goals from nowhere. We can always play Giroud but if the crosses arent good we wont score against you lot. Speaking of crosses, I think Ziyech will be key to winning this game. We missed him and Pulisic against Everton(our latest game where we lost 1-0) so I wouldnt take that game into consideration when talking about the threat of Chelsea, considering Ziyech and Pulsic will be back for the game. Jeez this post is getting too long.

"Today showed that Cholo made many mistakes. I haven't missed a single game this season this game, in particular, is the worst I've watched by far, we were offbeat from minute one. Some players that were starting shouldn't have. I just believed Suarez and Herrera was a terrible selection in our lineup I think an underwhelming Saul or even Kongdogbia in the middle of the park could've given us that control we seemed not to have at all. Correa was the obvious choice to start and Suarez would've offered a lot more coming off the bench in the last hour.

From minute one we should have pushed them back, Yannick and Tripps just pushing back their fullbacks giving us the width we needed and to actually dictate the play through Koke. Getting the ball to Joao, Llorente as much as possible. It was ours to win but we just didn't seem like we wanted to win. I hope when facing Sociedad we will not make those same mistakes and allow them to take control of the game.

It sucked to believe that we were going to take the front foot, win the game, widening the gap from all other teams, remain unbeaten, and to extend our 26 matches winning streak.

This is our year, every game is ours to win. I have the confidence to say that this loss will only reinforce the idea of what we are trying to achieve for this season.

One might argue that it could've been better had Simeone done this or some player did that, etc. But today was an outlier. Let's bounce back from this, and make the most of all the other games.

"Frustrated af, probably the worst Atleti performance in year. Meanwhile we are unlucky and as well.

First mistake, Saul should start today. I don’t care how bad he has been but this man always tries his bad when it matters. Games like today is where he strives for. While Herrera just can’t avoid mistakes ffs. 

Next, Simeone is rushing too much. When it’s approaching the end we’re reverting to old 4-4-2. But this bunch of players probably are not even familiar playing together lol. We were playing with front line of Correa and Llorente. Everyone doesn’t know what to do and it shows. 

He shouldn’t take the defensive approach anyway. Real aren’t even that good, but we are causing problem against ourselves.

I know many of you won’t like to hear that but this is the kind of game we miss Griezmann, we miss someone to look up to when things get complicated. It seems like everyone had no idea today once things didn’t go to plan.

Also taking off Felix is such a huge mistake. Why the fuck taking off your best attacker when we’re chasing a goal....

Another note is we miss Josema so ducking much.

The only bright point is perhaps Saul played better today. I think his form is more down to the role. When we reverted to 442 he looks good, just that he hasn’t adapted to the 3 atb system.

I’m so worried that we may have a big slump after today, and actually I think we’ve been underwhelming after the international break. As much as I hate losing to Real, Let’s hope we don’t let this loss affect us too much and keep delivering from next match. Today we played some really bad football, we gotta admit that, learn and improve. We’re still 1st, just need to drop less points than the others. We can always revenge when they visit Wanda.

"We have evolved as a team.

In the past we would beat big teams in big games by sitting back and hitting them on counter. That has always been Cholismo. We also dropped points to mid and low table teams with this style of play. Except for 2013-2014 we were never really close to winning the league because of all the dropped points. 

We have now evolved into a possession based team. This suits Suarez, Lemar, and Felix especially. Now we tend to drop fewer points against lesser teams which helps us in the league.

Yet now we seem to get overrun by the big teams in big games (Real Madrid, Bayern).

If we are not a good enough possession based team to go toe-to-toe with these teams then we need to revert back to Cholismo to beat these teams. However, Lemar and Suarez are especially useless with counter-attacking tactics and it doesn’t suit Felix, Trippier, or Herrera. Even Koke really plays better possession based futbol. 

Certainly, Carraso, Llorente, and Lodi play well on the counter-attack as demonstrated in the win against Liverpool. 

In short, we seem to have a roster that is better suited for possession based tactics. This is great in the league but we may not yet be good enough as a possession based team to beat the biggest teams. If we revert to defensive counter attacking against these teams then we may find that we don’t have the best squad for this style. 

We need a speedy RB and most importantly a CF that is suited to counter-attack. Morata did well in this role. Arias was best in this role but a healthy Vraslkjo is certainly speedier than trips.

"Ah, there we go, that feeling. That feeling of beeing an Atleti supporter? You guys all know what I am talking about here...Cholo and the gang made sure to bring it back, 'cause boy did we forget about it the past weeks.

Saul was not performing the past weeks, I know, but he is experienced to play on derbys god damn it. Cholo my friend, what are you doing? You don't want Saul? Give Kondo or Torreira a chance.

Moving on, Suarez has nothing to give on this team, appart from scoring on middle-table teams. He is an old wolf but nothing more, the team cannot win titles with Suarez and Diego Costa. I like them both but they have closed their football cyrcle.

Lodi: Big mistakes, Koke and Correa: Totally nowhere to be found, Felix and Marcos: Nothing special, Carrasco: Looked choked and tired. And all this on the most crucial game in La Liga so far.

Everyone was kind of a let down today among with our coach beeing the biggest. Cholo, we had that game. You handled it like you were playing FIFA and got mad on half time and did random changes. Oh well, guess what, half of the players on the pitch don't even know where they play anymore.

Apart from beeing perma mad on the todays performance I do feel sorry for Oblak. He gets so mad when our defence does shit and today was a pure shitshow.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Fuck this comment, I am just mad and sad, I will love all of them again in an hour or so.",gflh3hc,kbxsvb,atletico,2020-12-13 06:20:54,BlackRebel93,8

"After a lot of last season I was thinking it's only a matter of time before Joao is insisting to leave. Then this season came along and he's been playing well and with a smile on his face so I was more optimistic about him starting to like it here... Then Cholo takes him off in an important game like this for NO REASON!! I still love Cholo but he got almost everything wrong yesterday and Felix being subbed off only took off our best player and pissed him off, and for what!? Cholo's decision making against Real is atrocious and it makes me sad. Sorry for the rant.",gfpmmlb,kbxsvb,atletico,2020-12-14 00:34:18,AtleticoJayhawk96,2
"It was an awful game overall and probably the worst game of the season. The formation was wrong. Herrera was so poor, was a liability and shouldn't have started, Suarez disappeared again, Llorente poor especially when he moved left, Koke some crucial miss passes, the defense was not tight enough during set pieces at all. Another problem is when we had the ball we took a lot of time holding than ball rather than pass it and move it around and we started very poorly the first half with useless long balls and we had to play on the ground instead. The substitutions were very strange as well, when we were pressing and attacking why take out Joao and not Suarez? Then they scored and it took us time to recover and attack again which was too late. I hope it is a wake up call for all the team and all the fans who are prematurely celebrated the league that it is still a long way to go and it is not going to be easy. We have to pick ourselves up and win the next game partido a partido. We will face Cardassar next in the cup and I hope we don't play any first team players to rest them.

Suarez looks washed. All of his goals have come against far weaker teams when the match is already in Atleti’s favor. He was just a bandaid so the team could cash in on Morata at the end of the season. He can still put in good performances against the garbage teams but we need to go with a different approach against the big teams. Felix and Correa up top isn’t ideal but it’s better than throwing Suarez out there again.,gfldx65,kbxsvb,atletico,2020-12-13 06:02:22,nbarmijo,1
"seeing Joao's face when he was taken off was heartbreaking, Saul coming on was needed (he should have started in all honesty), but taking off the only player who has any intent of creating something, instead of static Suarez? 

And speaking of Suarez, I remember in his presentation video when he saw the wall of Atleti legends and said ""I hope they leave a space for me"", I can't see him coming close to that at his current level, he's been nonexistent. I wish we hadn't given Juve an option to sign Morata because I would take him back in a heartbeat right now

Back to Saul though, as much as he struggles, he has magic in his boots, while Herrera has cost us goal after goal after goal, all the while never creating anything meaningful (Leipzig, Bayern, even Lokomotiv, and now today).",gflil0w,kbxsvb,atletico,2020-12-13 06:29:38,hskywalker98,1

"Of course I'm pretty nervous for this match since it can really dictate how the rest of the season looks. However I think Simeone has prepared us with partido a partido knowing that this match doesn't control our whole season. 

We're going in with the advantage in that a draw doesn't hurt us as much as it does Madrid, they're playing at home and are already behind points despite playing a match more than us. They want to use this as a chance to catch back up with us while if we leave with a point that means Madrid also dropped two points. 

This could play into our hands if we're still tied late into the match when they try to go for a winner we can take advantage of that and maybe hit them on the counter. 

Now I don't want to play on the backfoot all match, we need to go in their and play the football we been playing all season. We can't be afraid of the moment and of Madrid, we beat one boogy man in Barca already we can do the same here.

"For those who are asking about the defensive record we ~~could~~ can break tomorrow, I repost here (as it may get buried in the comments):

If we win tomorrow and *hypothetically*, ~~concede 3 goals~~, we'll match the second-best defensive record of 5 goals conceded in 11 games set by 5 teams:

1. Real Madrid (1961/62)
2. Pontevedra (1965/66)
3. Barcelona (1968/69, 1977/78)
4. Deportivo La Coruña (1993/94)
5. Atletico Madrid (1987/88)

If we win tomorrow and *hypothetically*, ~~concede 2 goals~~, we'll match the best defensive record of 4 goals conceded in 11 games set by 2 teams:

1. Real Sociedad (1982/83)
2. Sporting Gijon (1985/86)

**However,**

a) **if we do not concede at all** and **remain at 2 goals conceded in 11 games**, or

b) (*~~concede a~~* ***~~maximum~~*** *~~of 1 goal~~*\*)\*,

**we'll set a new best defensive record in LaLiga history**, which if we manage to do (and I really hope we do), is unlikely to be repeated for quite some time afterwards.

**With that, I hope we win.**

**And maintain a clean sheet.**

**Aupa Atleti!**

"We did not win the derby in La Liga since 15-16 so it is a very difficult game and we need to be very careful defensively because RM is an opportunistic team. How they score usually is a cross from Lucas Vasquez, Ferland Mendy or Vinicius to Benzema. Benzema should be marked at all times and no one should cross or shoot from outside the box. We played a good derby game last season away especially in the first half but we lost the game because we were inefficient, there was no team chemistry and had a lot of injuries. Our current conditions are better and we have to take advantage of it. Counter attacks will be a key and at the same time we need to not waste chances in this game.

"WE DID IT BOYS HERE WE GO RO16!!!

Hats off to Salzburg, they played really well ngl. Luckily we got Carrasco back, who assisted Hermoso for his first goal to give us a breathing room, then proceeds to net the killer. He won us 3 points vs Barca, Valencia and this in such a short period of time.

Hermoso is immense. Correa coming on gave us a lot of opportunities as well, 7th assist this season! Felix, Suarez and Saul didn’t have a good game and it’s honestly concerning ahead of Derby, but we’ll see. 

Progressing is more than enough, I unironically thinks we’ll play better against bigger teams. Now it’s time to focus on La Liga, let’s hope for a win vs Real! Aupa Atleti",gf7p2k9,ka1iq9,atletico,2020-12-10 05:56:54,1ngK,27

Finally the nightmare in this group stage is done for good. In the first half we were countered a lot and they had a lot of dangerous chances but I am glad our defense was awake and glad we took a set piece goal finally. It was the same the second half until the end when Salzburg were exhausted and we were able to finish them. UCL done now to concentrate on La Liga. RM look like they are having their form back and are not going to be easy to beat.

"There is something really wrong with the RedBull Clubs.. 

They way they play is a literal advertisement of a bunch guys being on RedBull..

They just have too much energy and don't know what to do with it.. 

Their Last season squad would have crushed us with the chances they had with Haaland and Minamino..

The reason Suarez was taken off was they weren't even giving him a chance to be on the ball..Which is something I would like for our players tbh, that superhigh intensity that only whithers down in the last 10 minutes of the halves..

We played good defending football for the most part..But it was so painful to see us always clearing out the ball every time they attack only to have the ball returned to them..

I've said it before and will say it again, we really need to snipe up some RedBull players.. They are a literal goldmine of amazing young talent..

Werner, Haaland and Minamino were the best of them and got snatched up pretty quickly, won't be surprised if some of them move in the Winter or Summer to big clubs..",gf843as,ka1iq9,atletico,2020-12-10 08:07:08,iamtheone11111,9

Lokomotiv was completely defensive and did a solid job defending. Difficulty : Medium

Salzburg was totally offensive and with high energy, they went all out with their pressing and attack. Won balls back easily because of it and didn't need much defending. Difficult : Medium

Bayern was OP. They were well balanced with great individual talent. Difficulty : Hard

We got some great matches because of how unique each team was. We couldn't manage to dominate any teams in our group, so RO16 will obviously be tougher. Therefore, we should do better than this in RO16. Aupa!",gf8z0bh,ka1iq9,atletico,2020-12-10 13:04:13,bootyannihilator,3
"Let's appreciate Salzburg first of all. They were brilliant, and unlucky to have not scored on multiple occassions. Kudos to our back 4 and Oblak. They didn't panic and survived the constant high press. This game was more of endurance it seemed. We (somehow) held things together and then when they were tired, we started taking control. Typical atleti match. Glad to see another strong performance by the big man Felipe. Both the CBs had a decent game with numerous key interventions and tackles. Unlike the past few games, our forwards didn't get much help this time, and I think the reason is quite obvious - the constant pressure. I did observe the we lost the ball quite cheaply, which is bad because we barely escaped their counter somehow - and this can be a potential weakness that other teams will be looking to exploit. Also it's a HUGE relief to have Carrasco back. He was pivotal - not just scoring the goal or assisting the previous (goal from a set piece YAY!), but he held on to the ball, won us throw ins and corners, tried to control the game. That's great stuff. Saul has been lackluster ever since he returned from injury. I don't know if this is because of return of Koke to CM and the new system we've adapted, but it is just sad to see our Saul like this. He's a great player and pressure is mounting on him. Let's hope he gets a few good games. Maybe competition from Herrera (who has been putting up some good performances of late) and Kondogbia will help. 
Onto the next stop - DERBY WITH REAL!

As for the team as a whole another win. Really stepped up in the second half. Great substitutions from cholo.

"What a great performance. Just what we needed before the final in Salzburg. 

Suárez didn't scored, but his presence is enough to put the other team in discomfort, Valladolid didn't had much of a chance.

The effort of the midfield was great (let's not talk about Vitolo). Lemar was playing with a lot of intention since the beginning, this was his one and he made it. Adding up Llorente in the second half was just the right thing to do, and he killed it with Trippier to create the awesome combos they always do. 

The back line was good as well. The absence of Giménez Is there, but Felipe with Savic and Hermoso were plenty already. Oblak great as always.

"At this point Llorente is vying for best attacking player in Europe over the past 10 months or so.

Lemar was phenomenal in his Atleti debut which  was against Madrid in the Super Cup (Aug. 16 2018). It has been all down hill since then though. But it has been hard to give up hope on him because his debut was that good. I did give up on him though, some point end of last year. But he looks well and truly back now.

It's not the scoring that matters. It is the fact that when he lacked confidence, every time he got the ball he'd look up field then decide, nah, and cut back and pass it diagonal backwards. Now he is actually making forward passes. His success rate hasn't even been that great passing wise, but he at least has the confidence back.

Trippier also rebounded extremely hard after a few mediocre performances early in the season.",geqhbaw,k7dvot,atletico,2020-12-06 04:59:25,starvs,10

"I say this game after game... Trippier has to be our fittest player! 

We all hated it when Juanfran left, we hated the 30+ age policy for defenders (or in General) but I can finally see the vision of Cholo. This is the most attractive team we've had in my 11 years of supporting them, the most ""European"" like. We use to change our tactics to play against stronger teams, but it's the other way round now.

They park the bus, they change their tactics to play us. We have a style and certain swagger now, we are the team to beat and it's ours now to lose!

A few minorities moan about Cholo and his negativities - that's not a thing of the past but less prevalent now. We have depth, different tactics, different formations and most of all our Matador, Cholo!

I've never been so passionate about our team then now.

I am so happy with Lemar's performance. He had two difficult season and people were getting on him and were saying he should be sold. The previous games he showed serious talent and assistance to the team which we need in this point. Trippier two assists and a great defensive performance. Llorente quick to score after the good counter and this is what we always need from counters to be played very quickly. First half we played decently but we were countered by Valladolid and they had a couple of shots as well while it was hart to penetrate their defense. Second half we started to take chances in the box and it was nice to finish the game with the second goal. Salzburg next game is very difficult and different as they will be attacking us but we can counter then we have the derby which will be a very difficult game as well. Quarter of the season is done and we keep going.,gequ55c,k7dvot,atletico,2020-12-06 06:36:30,mos1992,1

As much as I admire Simeone for everything he did for the club, I find it kinda disappointing how stubbornly reluctant he can be to give new players a chance.

Josema injuring himself going for a clearance, forcing Felipe to play and him giving up a pen is textbook El Pupas. I also thought Saul was a no-show today, and without putting in too much blame on Felipe, he was not prepared at all today (the pen, missing the chance, misplacing passes etc). 

Finally we need to improve set piece finishing, had a Josema and Hermoso header go high which would've sent us clear through.

"Pathetic, I’m indeed frustrated and annoyed.

How many times we go back to defend a lead just for us to fuck up later? Simeone has to realise that this team isn’t suited to do that. It’s actually safer for us to control the game. Or at least chase for a second before defending ffs.

Felix had such a good first half, shame that we didn’t capitalise on his form and score more. Should’ve went more aggressive in the second half. Also why are we don’t making subs, we should continue plugging players if we’re to shithouse this through. As much as Felipe did bad, I can’t completely blame him because man was rusty af. Simeone needs to rotate players more often to make sure they have the sharpness, instead of rotting them on the bench. 

I hate how it’s going because it’s never guaranteed Salzburg won’t win. I don’t want to see us in Europa because of all these stupid displays in UCL this season.

And by the way, I don’t get how are we so bad at finishing, it’s ridiculous at this point. 20 shots but 4 on target and only 1 goal, we just can’t score for our own sake.

"This one seems like a Simeone blunder. For the last month, since Josema came back from injury, he didn't had a single minute of rest, and with his history of injuries, that was a ticking bomb. Surely we could afford to start Felipe at least once in this time. Maybe that wouldn't change the injury of Jose, but at least we would have given Felipe time to get some form. After month on the bench he was extremely rusty and I can't really blame him for that. 

And secondly, the last 20 minutes of the game was just the start of the last season all over again. Instead of trusting his team to play their game, Simone opts to once again send all 10 guys to defend and we seen this movie way to often last season - this team just can't suffer like the old Atleti did. This team has so much more chance to kill the game playing their natural game and I though Simeone already figured that out, but I was wrong.  


And also, Jesus guys, what's with the hate for Koke and especially Saul. Yes, Saul didn't make any impact in our offense, but the amount of ground those two cover, those timely interceptions and cover up for the defenders in instrumental in our defense. The game doesn't only consist the attack - there is the reason why we have conceded 6 goals without Saul against Bayern and Salzburg, and only three goals with him on the pitch all season long. But I guess that's kind of his fault - for so long we had the luxury to see him play equally well on both sides of the pitch so now nobody seems to care about his defensive impact.",geb0qm3,k4v16m,atletico,2020-12-02 06:16:17,Lavonbatis,6

It was a game we could have won but again our inefficiency in front of goal hurts us again. We had very good chances all game long to put it to bed but missed it. The second error was very late substitutions and it was apparent our players especially the attacking ones were exhausted by the 70th minute. Therefore they could not get back to defend during counters and we got pressured until Felipe tackled Muller. After the subs it was too late to do something although we missed chances which could have won us the game. We could have secured qualification today and rest players next week for the derby but it is not going to happen as we chose the hard way. A draw will be enough but Salzburg are very offensive and our defense has to be better intact. A disappointment today but we go again against Valladolid who are regaining their form so it is not going to be easy either.,gebuv96,k4v16m,atletico,2020-12-02 10:47:15,mos1992,3
"Here's what I learned today..

Carrasco is a beast at dribbling..one of the best dribbles I've seen the way he just so effortlessly gets the ball to the final third is amazing.. BUT, he's our teams Vinicius Jr. His shooting hasn't been that great for a while and his final cross/pass aren't always the best..Countless of times he got the ball to a goalscoring position but failed to find any Atleti players..He did have that one superb pass tho which llodente rocketed..

Suarez or any Main Striker is very important for Jao Felix game.. Felix needs someone who can take the eyes of defenders off of Felix and onto himself so that he can freely do his thing..Since Suarez is out, none of our goals have come from the center through his build up..

Llorente and Trippier are our best attacking threats right now..They link up amazingly on the right hand side and 4/5 times they have the ball, they manage to put in a deadly ball..And they use a very simple technique..Trippier has a standoff with the LB while Llorente is making a dangerous run..If the LB moves towards llorente, he'll play a through ball unleashing llorente, if the LB moves towards llorente, he'll simply cut in with the ball himself or have enough space opened up to make a cross himself.. but doesn't work that well when the person inside the box are not taking good enough positioning..

Cholo needs to find a role for Saul..Hes one of our most capped players, been with us since Day 1, has always been a great player and loves the club.. But, he plays very similarly to Koke currently but on a couple of levels slightly below him ..Cholo needs to find out what he brings to the team currently and how to improve on it..

Both Koke and Saul take a lot of random shots from distance which aren't very close and usually ends with us loosing possession..  Needs to work on them or create better plays by passing to others in these situations..

Correa's finishing is a bit off and his position needs to be interchanged with Llorente..I think he can provide similar services from RM role as that has always been his primary position While we are currently molding Llorente from CDM to RM and it would be easier to get him to train to be a striker as he has the speed, dribbles and the most important, his shooting ability.. 

Hermaso is perfect as our starting choice LB until Lodi can start playing more like him..Lodi might bring alot to Brazil in a Marcelo-esque role but he doesn't have the great linkup with Carrasco as Llorente and Trippier have so they often end up taking each others space and the attacks being lackluster.. 

Savic and Ginminez are beasts and we need them to stay fit throughout the season.They are literally the backbones of our defence and I hope Giminez only had a slight knock instead of a long term injury.. He got injured while stopping a great one on one goalscoring opportunity for Bayern which just shows his dedication to us..

Felipe has been out of the squad for so long that he actually forgot how to play.. I wouldn't blame the penalty a 100% on him as there was nothing he could do about it once he missed with his challenge.. He needs to be rotated into the squad more often in order to give rest to our starting CBs and also to maintain his form..This clearly showed that being locked out of the squad for so long isn't a good situation for anybody..And I just fear what has happened to Saponjic's game whenever he gets another shot..

Herrara didn't do much as he came on too late but if he has recovered and playing like he did pre injury, he should start the next match instead of Saul..Even a fully fit Torriera would be a better option in this state.. 

Lemar needed to be brought on earlier to replace the frustrated Felix..Although not on par with Felix's talent, he does bring a similar gameplay to him with his dribbles and crosses.. 

Boy of the hour..Felix..firstly, he looked amazing throughout the first half be it his goal, his passing, his backheels, or just his dribbles..it looked like he was enjoying the game.. But down the line, he seemed to be getting more and more frustrated with how the game was turning out as alot of opportunities were missed in the first half and in the second, our team decided to play it ""safe"" and pass back ignoring some of his runs..You could clearly see the frustration on his face when he would rather wait in an offside position waiting for the play to come forward than actually make the run back..

OBLAK! What can I say but it was an amazing performance by him since he helped us out a lot in the second half..He was very determined in this match..even guessed the Penalty right and had it not been for Muller's perfect placement, it would have been saved..Again, not blaming him for this..

CHOLO..impressed by his techniques in the first half as that has been some of the most fluid atleti attacks since the last time Suared played..but for the second half, it clearly felt as if everyone was told to play out the 1-0 instead of going in for the kill..A one goal advantage versus Bayern is never a very promising situation..Should have continued with the intensity well into the extra time..There is a reason why 5 subs are available.. He should have subbed off Correa, Felix and/or Saul as soon as he saw Gnabry and Muller getting into the game.. These are some of the worlds best players and known to be gamechangers and brought in some pace, fresh legs and energy into the Bayern Side.. Even when we did make changed, they were defense minded with the hoped of playing out the 1-0.. Felipe's form is also on his head as he has played almost the same 11 throughout the season barring the injuries and COVIDS with almost the same 5 subs too..just in different orders.. It is obvious the players who haven't seen the face the of the pitch for a while will be rusty..But subbing off Giminez for Felipe wasn't part of a plan but something that he was forced to do..But again..if he was wiser, he could have subbed Giminez for Lodi and switch Hermaso back to CB..poor foresight from him..

"The pre and post match reactions are so contrasting. Lot of us felt that even a draw would be a good result.. And here we have it xD 
Honestly it shouldn't have been that way. Yes, Felipe seems a bit jaded, but we easily could've scored a couple of goals. I think today was the classic example of the need of a true ""Number 9"". We sorely missed Suarez, someone who can finish well, or atleast draw defenders away and create chances. Sad to see Costa injured and Suarez might just remain unavailable for a couple of occassions since he isn't covid negative yet. I just think, are Saponjic &amp; Camello so bad that they can't start ? Okay maybe not UCL, but I think it is high time we test them in La Liga now (considering they'll definitely start in Copa Del Rey). Reason - Felix &amp; Correa need some rest and also can't keep on playing a striker all the time. They're SS - playing behind the striker. Felix was great but let's not over rely purely on him. 
Let's also consider that the team we played with is also perhaps the most creative and attacking one in terms of players. We just lacked a true finisher. It sucks to not win, but okay we got a point atleast. Next game becomes a must win. Onwards and Upwards. Aupa Atleti!",gectryy,k4v16m,atletico,2020-12-02 18:24:46,ak5effect,3

Vrsaljko thinks like a RB, not a wingback, which he needs to be trained on ASAP..instead of making forward runs to get the ball, he just stays back and just returns the ball to Savic when all the passages forward are blocked..Heck, even fullbacks like Lodi make more runs and help in creativity..

Saul looked not shit and that shouldn't be something good..

Llorente had a couple of knocks here and there and I hope he's alright..

The few times Felix got involved, he looked quality but sadly no one was looking for him throughout the entirety of the time he was on..

Suarez is a beautiful bastard.. Shithousing his way to the win..If this was the Suarez from a couple of seasons ago, we would have seen a proper banger instead of a dive for the penalty..A faster player like Dembele could have gotten a couple of goals if played instead of Suarez, but who am I to complain when he gets the job done and is clinical af..

"Suarez is such a crazy upgrade on what Morata was, although that pen was not a pen lol

Felix - what is going on?? He's invisible for nearly the entire half, and both chances he had were such weak shots, although the first was a great save.

Trippier is hugely missed, Vrsaljko couldnt link up nearly as well with Llorente, who still managed to be crucial with his press (as seen in the first goal).

Good win but awful performance overall. We looked very disorganized and repeated the same plays even if it did not work. Everyone were not playing on the ground and just random air balls. There were a lot of players who were not performing: Carrasco was very bad defensively and offensively could not push forward at all. Vrsjalko was getting pulled out of position a lot and it seems the 3-2-3-2 does not suit him. Also most of Eibar's crosses were from his side and usually no one covered it well. With Joao coming in we started to somehow play on the ground for two or three plays but all the goals we scored today were due to errors from Eibar's defense and individual brilliance from Llorente and Suarez. In the second half of the season we will play a lot of tough away games and I hope this was just an off day performance and not the norm for the upcoming games.,gk58ung,l29c3h,atletico,2021-01-22 13:02:30,mos1992,3
"Correa or Lemar simply couldn't turn fast enough to get over the Eibar pressure, and we didn't have a quick passer in the middle that could bypass the traps set by their defensive approach. Both Llorente and Saul tend to drive the ball upfield and that's too slow for the pressure they did. 

Vrsaljko is no Trippier: a couple of through balls  would have forced them to run back and made them lower the pressing block, but he didn't see the million runs Llorente initiated so nothing came out of it. On the other hand he completely dried up Inui, so good defensive work but we need more than that from the wingbacks.  

Carrasco's penalty was a fluke, but bad spatial awareness on his part. He had an off night in general, you could sense his frustration, but our only danger was when he could pierce their defense. I feel like Lodi for Filipe and a 4-4-2 would have liberated Carrasco and allowed him to combine with Lemar higher up the pitch. We didn't need three central defenders  for their only centre forward. And it'd have also created a space for a Llorente-Correa paring on the right since Vrsaljko wasn't up to it.   

It's worrying that Felix is so disconnected  from the team. He had a couple of great runs, but he's not finding his place in this 5-3-2, and the amount of kicking he gets does not help. We need him back in his November form, because Suarez won't carry us the whole season. 

But for now.. Wow. Suarez makes a huge difference even if he can't run anymore.. It's like El Cid.. winning battles after dead. As long as you put him near the area, he'll find a way to score. That makes teams think twice about parking the bus with us, they need to try to defend us up the pitch because having Suarez in the penalty box it's really easy that we score on a rebound or a lost ball or just a one time combination and you can't really stop that. That makes the 1-1s and 0-0s of last year turn into wins, which is the difference between a CL spot and a league contender.  


Looking forward to Valencia's game. If we win that, we will be one game away from 50 points in half a season, that's huge.",gk6pu3u,l29c3h,atletico,2021-01-22 23:12:55,nanook9,3

"David Villa 2.0 winning us more points. Tho many of us predicted it, it's still wild to see.

Besides that, we really shouldnt be running 3atb without Trippier/Hermoso. Vrsa clearly doesn't know how to play wingback. Llorente needs his english buddy to support him. Absolute bullshit we won't have Trips against Chelsea.

Fortunate result, but that's what happens when you have proven goal scorers like Luisito. They bail you out.

AUPA ATLETI PA' SIEMPRE

"What a good victory. This match was an important one to secure our place in the table.

Trippier back just shows how important he is right now. Hopefully FIFA declares something more fair to his situation. 

Lemar is really good in the control, Suarez distracted their defenders perfectly and Llorente is a monster with that assist to Saul, I'm very happy to watch him score.

Now, to Eibar. Without Koke I guess it will be harder, but we can do it. Aupa Atleti!!!",gj1sq89,kw2ejw,atletico,2021-01-13 06:29:17,FrkM,71

I think I might get downvoted for saying this but Sevilla could've very well drawn or even won the game if they hadn't missed those sitters(Acuna and En nesyri missed open goals and the tap in by Carlos). When this strategy by Cholo works out at the end all is well but when it doesn't everyone would be hell bent on criticising Simeone.,gj1wl8k,kw2ejw,atletico,2021-01-13 07:00:42,nsaha234,40

"Fantastic win. This is why you need to be clinical.

We didnt really have many or any big chances, but Correa and Saul’s great strikes are what it takes. Immense performance from our right side. Trippier is so impressive today.

Most importantly, hope this goal will be a turning point for Saul, he deserves it!

Another day staying top of the table, hope we continue the good form. Next game we’ll be without Koke, time for the team to step up without our capitan. Aupa Atleti",gj1tgdr,kw2ejw,atletico,2021-01-13 06:35:08,1ngK,28

"This match proved that all our players want to perform, even Correa and Saul who were in a slump, have scored for us when we needed them to step up..


I love how compared to previous years where we hoped for Griezmann to bring out a goal from his ass, we have now moved to a place where we can expect goals from anywhere by anyone.. Not saying that the Griezmann era was bad, but now almost everyone in our squad has the potential to be the main player..

"Always a difficult game against Sevilla.

Good first half, not so good second half but that's also because Sevilla is playing much better in the second half. Nice to see Saul scoring there, hopefully he can step up his game since Koke will be suspended for the match against Eibar. And hopefully Felix too, he's been dire in the past few games but clearly has the quality to get back in form.

Also I get more and more nervous with every passing game that Joao starts on the bench. Wondering what the situation is there. 

Regardless, four points clear with two games in hand. Partido a partido, mi querido atléti!

"Really tough game. I'd say the toughest next only to the loss to RM, and tougher than the draws. Sevilla kept coming and at least a couple of times they could've scored and just didn't. But, it's another clean sheet! That Back 5 formed up, plus of course Oblak, and the three CMs in front, are ultimately near-unplayable.

So happy to see Saul score! The relief and joy was evident. Assisted by another superb Llorente run, who was again set on his way by Trippier, who also assisted Correa. Trippier is so important to this team. That was a tougher match than the result may show but in the end, that also makes this win even more satisfying.

We also seem to struggle to come back this year when we concede first. There is no urgency or plan b just like Bayern and especially the derby.

"Terrible performance. Pathetic effort. The bench/rotational players are supposed to use these opportunities to show they can compete for minutes in bigger matches. None of the players did that today. They just cemented their places on Cholo’s bench list for the long haul. 

Playing without a true striker shouldn’t have mattered against a third division side but nobody stepped up to the task. Cholo needs a proper backup striker in January. The team will lose without one. 

Ricard might not have made contact with the keeper but doing what he did while on a yellow shows his immaturity. He needed to play intelligently to show he wants to compete for the upcoming open RB role. He had momentum from the first game in the tournament and threw it all away. Back to square one for him.

"If anyone cares, here are the masterclass calls from the referee trio yesterday:

[This call was given as a freekick for Cornella which directly led to their goal. Gimenez also had to be subbed out injured because of it. Its clearly a freekick for Atletico as the Cornella player kicks Gimenez. Bonus info, Gimenez got a yellow.](https://i.gyazo.com/67f5c1599d6b040da52b6a8f3cc8f764.mp4)

[Second yellow card for Ricard. Its a stupid move from Ricard but as per the video he only hits the goalkeepers glove (the white thing) and not his head. Could it be a second yellow? Probably, but the referee clearly got pressured because of how bad the keeper ""cried"" about his face getting hit](https://gyazo.com/f562f2aac8626b57ba35704de0af3663)

[Offside call on Vitolo. Odd how its offside since hes on Atleticos half](https://i.gyazo.com/0756698f18c6cf64476bce40cfd6fc5a.mp4) 

[Elbow on Torreira. Cornella player goes in first with his elbow. Yellow card maybe? Not even a foul was given. Deliberate elbow.](https://i.gyazo.com/7b7f218a80715257740315d17d4553f0.mp4)

[Ricards first yellow card. The yellow is deserved for the push, but does the Cornella player not impede him? They are no where near the ball as Ricard has played it forward towards the end line.](https://i.gyazo.com/86f51412111ab11fe641c290da6312e7.mp4)",gif0spu,krue3z,atletico,2021-01-07 19:56:51,Takka_Tikka,2

Glad that we're able to score another. Such a lovely build up. Lodi to Lemar, who feints to Saul. put a perfect pass to Felix and a killer ball, Suarez to kill this off. Lovely goal, this is what it takes to win the league.

"**My subs for 2nd half:** 

Joao for Lemar

Kondogbia for Correa

Kondogbia as CM/DM and Koke a little bit further forward

**My humble thoughts:**

Llorente should shift back to RM; that goal he scored happened when he was running the channels in anticipation of Suarez' pass

Joao can start alongside Suarez but ultimately drift in the center or from deep, looking to find spaces; also, they should definitely pass the ball to him as often as possible

**Aupa Atleti!**",ghypydm,kpm541,atletico,2021-01-04 00:13:29,Aeorith,5

The defence is also showing signs of the same, they react a millisecond later, and that is causing all the pinball style goals that we have been conceding recently. I don't know if it's a confidence issue, or they are just tired and it's a physical thing, but it's been there since Alaves. 

Felix seems to be on a similar slump. In his case, I think it's just lack of match form due to the COVID downtime, but curiously enough he's usually sharper in the second half, like he needs to slowly warm up to the game. Let's see if he can get back to his 2020 self soon because we need him ASAP.  


The only players that looked sharp in the last two games are Lemar and Llorente, and yesterday they were too deep back to be dangerous. They will play higher up the pitch if Carrasco and Trippier are back, and that helps, but the issue is still there. We can survive to a shaky defence that concedes a fluke goal sometimes, but not if the attack doesn't flow normally.",gokrjnb,lrb2m0,atletico,2021-02-24 20:43:39,nanook9,10

"Surprising we defended so far in our back when our best defensive performances this season have been with a much higer line. I don't know whether the players we are missing + our recent perfomances drove us to a plan that has worked for us in the UCL in the *past*. With thay being said, I don't feel like Chelsea were creating a lot of clear chances and the goal was very unlucky, but still very frustrating to watch the game develop, especially since we have seen this before, it's not 2014/2016 anymore.

We have been going through a rough patch for a while now, and we were depending too much on Llorente, Koke and Suarez individual performances compared to our peak earlier in the season. I can only hope that once we get our players back, we can at least get Llorente back in his position and try to grow from there. 

The second leg is on the 17th so I hope the team can try to get into a positive trend for then (for the sake of the UCL, and the league).",goigydi,lqu6h1,atletico,2021-02-24 05:55:51,Cefalido,28

"It starts to become worrying, our form is just too shit in 2021. 

I think the missing players are just so crucial. Gimenez for sure, and missing Carrasco and Trippier is hurting so much. They are the essential pieces for this system, without them we look toothless as we got no threat on the sides. Putting Llorente there only make things worse, it limits our best player. 

Also I don’t know why Simeone plays defensive again, Chelsea’s defence is shit and we should’ve played a more open game. 

On the bright side, they miss Mount and Jorginho next match and it’s a huge boost for us if we have every player available in the second leg. We just need a 1 goal win next game, not impossible.

I just hope we can recover our form, the schedule ahead of us is so, so tough. If we fuck up here then the season can end already.

"You cant just sit back vs a team with as much talent as Chelsea and hope the dont score. Especially with two makeshift wingbacks. Atleti lucky Chelsea cant score for shit otherwise this tie would be over after the first leg.


Not to mention, playing on counter when your two men upfront(Suarez and Felix) play their best football when the team dominates possession is weird. This just isnt a sustainable strategy against big teams especially when Atleti does not have the counterattacking prowess of past. Felix and Lemar are good ball carriers and Llorente can run but its nothing a good defence cant deal with. And towards the end, Chelsea kept pressing making it harder to attack woth freedom cuz you dont want to give another away goal.

Horrific tactics and I really don't understand Correa, even when he performs well I don't see the point in playing him. Llorente is wasted playing the right back position and Saul literally did nothing all game. Joao Felix barely touched a ball and Suarez and Lemar were the only players clicking on offense.

The UCL for me is collateral damage but the situation is bad. For the third game in a row we are trying to play with Llorente as a right back and it is a total disaster. We didn't have players to move us forward from the wings at all. The definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. This is the same as when Saul was moved to LB some games last year and it was a total disaster. A lot of players were bad today and the team has to go back to the drawing boards to figure something out for the next game. We did not beat Villareal since 2015 in the Madrigal so a win there would give us some confidence but otherwise we are going in a downward spiral.,goiiiku,lqu6h1,atletico,2021-02-24 06:07:55,mos1992,3

"One of the single worst performances I’ve seen from Atletico in a few recent seasons. I know Simeone is a god on this forum and he’s a great manager but what the actual fuck was that? 

That performance is genuinely fucking embarrassing. We didn’t just lose, we got dominated in every aspect. 

Simeone needs to be a man and stop playing cowardly tactics that are clearly outdated. I firmly believe that with our 3-1-4-2 we would have 3-1’d Chelsea today. Yet Cholo decides to play out of the back against a team that presses like mad dogs. 

Playing counter attacking football doesn’t work anymore. I cannot fathom that nobody can see it. Pressing eliminates counter attacking teams and that’s what Chelsea did today. 

I cannot find a single positive in the entire 96 minutes played today. We sat and coward in the corner like little rats while an out of form Chelsea team hammered at the door for 85 minutes. 

Suarez is a great striker but he’s useless with these tactics. Joao Felix is isolated, Llorente is underused, lemar is underused. Our team is flat, and boring, and predictable. And we got our shit kicked in by the much superior team today.

Sure we have a couple of first team players out but that’s no excuse. This performance was god fucking awful and anybody that tells me otherwise is WRONG.",goiibmf,lqu6h1,atletico,2021-02-24 06:06:22,AtleticoFan17,10

Cholo have clearly reverted back to the traditional defensive 4-4-2 and I don't blame him with the recent run of games.

Positives:
The team has been defending really well and hence feel like the good ol' Atleti. They managed to make  impressive strings of passes in their build-up play.

Negatives:
The team has lost possession in a stupid and unnecessary fashion far too much. They seem to really struggle connecting in the final third.

If they want to score from counters, subbing on Dembélé would be a good choice.

" * La Liga leaders Atlético Madrid are unbeaten in 13 UEFA Champions League (UCL) home games (W9, D4). The hosts are favourites to win this leg, and any winning goal might come late, as three of Atlético’s last five UCL home victories have seen their deciding goal come beyond the 75th minute.

 * Six of those nine wins in Atlético’s current unbeaten UCL run at the Wanda Metropolitano have come against opposition from a top-five European domestic league, ending 1-0 or 2-0 (average margin: 1.67 goals). Half of the Rojiblancos’ ten goals scored across those six wins against such ‘elite’ opposition came between the 76th minute and FT.

 * Chelsea remain unbeaten under the management of Thomas Tuchel, but trailed at HT for the first time under his fledgling regime at the weekend, recovering to snatch a draw via Mason Mount’s second-half penalty. It was also from a 12-yard stare that Chelsea got their last Premier League away win, and both goals - curiously - arrived between the 50th-59th minutes of play.

 * The visitors’ good recent form provokes hopes of a surprise win here, and the ‘over 2.5’ goals characteristic applies to each of the Blues’ four preceding UCL wins. In addition to averaging 1.0 penalty goal per UCL match since matchday two, Chelsea have also beaten the -2 handicap in three UCL victories, while winning both halves and winning one half by a precise 1-0 scoreline.

 * Players to watch: João Félix gave Atlético a HT lead in their last UCL home game against opposition from a top-five European league (D 1-1). Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud was a man possessed in his last trip to Spain, netting four times against Sevilla, and three of his last four decisive UCL goals have come via his head.

 * Hot stat: Chelsea have converted nine (32.14%) of their 28 shots on target recorded during Tuchel’s regime to date.

"We have never beaten Chelsea at a home game. We need to start the game with the right formation and tactics which means Ricard needs to start to let Llorente concentrate on offense. I think also playing with a 4-4-2 is the way to go especially with missing players. It is also important to close the lines and rely on counter attacks. Chelsea are a very untested and unfamiliar team especially with Tuchel in charge, a very good attacking manager.",gof1570,lpydt8,atletico,2021-02-23 10:52:00,mos1992,5

"The match is going to happen so late by my time and I need to wake up early. I'll sleep for 2 hours that's fine but this game better be a good one. Also no Llorente on RWB/RB please. Our best player (arguably) gets wasted in defense, when he can create chances and score screamers. It'll be interesting to see the lineup though. 3-5-2 or a 4-4-2. Considering we'll be without both of our regular wing backs. Also, we have a depleted squad, and Chelsea now have Pulisic &amp; Havertz available. They are fast on counters. I'm a bit nervous, but on the flipside, this could be Chelsea's best chance at winning. If we mange this time somehow, by the time next fixture comes, we'll (hopefully) have full strength.

"So, so fucking ridiculous result today, Levante took 5 points off us. But please, don't put it too harsh on players.

This is what you call an unwinnable game, they had 2 shots on goal and that's it, wtf. We have like 25 shots and their keeper is playing like prime Yashin or whatever. This is not a bad performance from us, not at all. They scored through a pin ball deflection, nothing we could do there. 

We played so well in the 2nd half, one of the best performances recently if you ask me tbh.

Covid, FA, injuries and now this bad luck in front of goal, things aren't going well for us lately but don't lose faith. Every season is like this for us, exactly at this period. We will get through this tough time. Chelsea didn't play well today too, let's hope we can take the win we much needed next week.

Aupa Atleti.

"This is the type of game that makes me not want to love football. The type of thing that would never in a million years happen to real madrid. This was prime El Pupas.

We had good chances, great chances even, but it's hard to blame the boys when the referees in the VAR room are just jerking each other off.

Our first half was absolutely terrible but the second half was honestly great. Felix (with his fluffed shot) and Llorente (when he made a bad decision of not playing Joao) couldve won us the game but it wasn't to be. I cant blame them, we lost as a team today, everyone fucked up. Lost to a beast of a goalkeeper, poor finishing, a terrible first half, blind refs, and just absolutely terrible luck. 

Positives? We played great in the 2nd half, and if we had just two or three of those chances in any other game, we'd win. The boys will learn from this, and we'll be more clinical against Chelsea.

There are times when I get mad at this sport but I will never get mad at Atleti. We must support the boys as we will achieve great things this season.

"Besides the loss, I  see some huge positives from this match, especially in the second half. 

Llorente obviously is great going forward and that's where he needs to play all the time. 

Felipe and Hermoso played very very well in the second half and were outmuscling and intercepting every ball. This is huge given that Gimenez is made of glass. 

Lemar is playing like Messi and was just very unlucky today not to score. He's just starting right where he left off.

This guy Dembele is a real baller. I had never seen him play before, but the hold-up play, the ability to turn his body to get a shot on goal from a weird angle, and playing physically and aggressively upfront is going to be very valuable for us. I want to see him play more minutes. 

Some negatives: 

Felix is rusty still and I pray that he gets back to form soon. 

Pretty poor first-half setup and obvious fatigue from players. 

Both the right and the left sides are not secure at the moment. We need both Carrasco and Trippier back. 

Koke and Kondogbia did not play very well today. I don't think Kondogbia is a good fit for this 3-5-2. If we are gonna play Kondogbia, it has to be in a 4-4-2. 

This is going to set us back and frankly, I don't think that we have what it takes to win La Liga if Barca and Real keep winning the rest of their matches. If we had a full squad, we would be at least 10 points ahead at the moment, but we have been very unlucky. It's gonna be tough.",go4xdn7,lobn6b,atletico,2021-02-21 01:20:28,atmsmbk,5

Felix: decent game but skyrocketed a big chance in the first half, missed two sitters and had a good volley which their goalkeeper saved superbly. Would’ve scored if Llorente didn’t make a terrible decision.
Llorente: stop putting him at RWB please. Played good but probably made the games worst decision by not playing Felix which would’ve made it 1-1. Depressing 
Kondogbia: Takes about 10 seconds for him to make a simple pass and lost the ball for the first goal. Hade a good second half but did not make up for his error",go4xdfs,lobn6b,atletico,2021-02-21 01:20:25,Willezzon,2

Felix could have had a hat-trick

Suarez had a beauty of a freekick which could have went in

Lemar also had a couple of great shots

I think in the first half we were too light most probably for the Chelsea game which ended up costing us..

Villareal away, no win since 2015. The derby, we did not win in La Liga since 2016 and at home since 2015. Again the tactics were totally wrong and the formation was lacking defensive composure and we conceded as expected. We were also lost offensively. Second half with the changes we were playing much better and we did't deserve to lose with the second half performance but the game is played over two halves. We faced very bad luck trying to score and we should have scored at least two goals. I hope we do not have many more injuries or Covid because we still do not have enough squad depth to cover for injuries or suspensions. We have players who have no replacement. I hope we play like second half vs Chelsea but for me UCL is collateral damage and we should focus more on Villarreal",go4zdn5,lobn6b,atletico,2021-02-21 01:36:51,mos1992,2

"I completely do not understand how it has not been clear to Cholo that we lose so much by moving Llorente to RWB. When he changes position mid-game the dynamic shifts and he actually finds himself in dangerous positions. Instead, you make him expend all of his energy covering the entire flank. He looked gassed by the end of the match.

João man, we didn’t get a replay of the Suarez cross so I’m not sure if the defender impeded him but that and Llorente’s cross were right there. Kondogbia also put him on goal in the first half. He was suffering a drop in form before he was sidelined with Covid and it hasn’t done him any good to not get game time.

This was the first match where the toll of having so many players unavailable over the past couple of weeks was really evident. We just couldn’t physically do it in the first half. This is what’s worrying me for Tuesday - a tired Suarez, Correa and João out of it and Dembele not yet integrated, it is going to be very hard to find “home” goals - on the other end, conceding this much to mid-table sides and now with Gimenez possibly out, how will we stand up to Chelsea’s offensive firepower?",go56ia7,lobn6b,atletico,2021-02-21 02:35:02,cheppers,2

"Llorente is the only one that is capable of producing anything in this team playing against a tight team like Levante. He played more than half of the first half as a right wingback where he is decent but not effective at all. We do need to switch to a 4-4-2 in the second half maybe. Gimenez is playing well with the ball he can play right back. Everyone else is pretty much ineffective right now. Felix is completely nulled out and we don't even know if he is in the game. Suarez can't do shit upfront on his own, there is no service at all. Koke and Kondogbia playing together in a 3-5-2 never work. Maybe we can still get a draw out of this match but things have to change for that. This is why I have been telling everyone on this sub to stop celebrating La Liga in December. It only takes a couple of things to go wrong and the house of cards starts falling. 

I know we have what it takes to beat this Levante team in the second half, but things are gonna need to change for that to happen. Lemar in possibly and Llorente can't play RWB again no matter what. Llorente attacked three times and all three times he attacked dangerously. Others keep losing the ball or passing back and nothing happens going forward. He is the catalyst for our attacks and he has to be able to make those runs down the right. So, please stop limiting him by playing him at RWB.",go4p623,lo8b00,atletico,2021-02-21 00:11:18,atmsmbk,6

"The sub didn't work, and after that Correa miss things just gone downhill for us. Koke particularly is very poor in the second half.

Llorente shouldn't be played as wingback, we wasted his stamina by forcing him to handle the whole right flank.

It'a a draw but feel like a loss with that Correa miss.

Hopefully Lemar can come back ASAP so we can go back into Koke-Lemar-Llorente midfield trio instead of this.",gnsuxyt,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 03:57:22,rainsong94,23
"So fucking frustrating, but shit happens sometime. We only committed two big mistakes, first one ended up as a goal conceded, and the Correa miss really bit us in the ass. It’s frustrating because how well we controlled the game, it was a really good game from us bar these mistakes.

Simeone deserves blame as well, he over complicated things. There’s no need to sub Kondogbia for Sime, it slowed down things, made Llorente less dangerous for a defensive presence which we don’t exactly need here. Im sure if we simply continued our way into the second half we would be way better. 

And Correa, sigh. Shit happens sometimes, hard to not blame him but it’s funny how he saved our 2 points few days ago and does this now.

We need to stop conceding these careless goals and focus now. We slipped up so many times recently and it’s not good to see. Need a good match before Chelsea clash, very badly.",gnsvnsv,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 04:02:39,1ngK,21

Onwards and upwards. Aupa Atleti!",gnsv4mr,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 03:58:42,ak5effect,9
Cannot fucking fathom that Correa missed an ABSOLUTE SITTER. Our defense went from air tight to more open than a prostitute’s legs. We need to get our shit together VERY soon. Otherwise we bottle this. Real and Barcelona have finally found form and we’re over here scrambling to pick up 3 points from mid table fodder.,gnsvq3y,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 04:03:07,AtleticoFan17,9
"I'm genuinely surprised that Simeone decided to play Llorente at wing back, he's shown time and time again what a difference maker he is upfront, subbing off Carrasco just to put Saul on the left who BTW wasn't really having a good game makes no sense.  With those two moves we lost fire power upfront.


As for Correa miss, Correa is literally a gamble, he might score the game winner or he might miss a sitter, he's a genuinely frustrating player. 
All in all I can't wait for Lemar to be back, his influence on our attacking build up is sorely missed,we lack composure in the final third",gnsvvbx,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 04:04:12,Maximum-Ad832,9

"First half we started very well and then the defense let us down when we conceded the first goal but we bounced back and got the goal to draw. Rest of the half we were dangerous and very optimistic for the second half. In the second half the substitutions made us much weaker. Why sub Vrsjalko out if we were doing well offensively? and why let Llorente have the burden to come back to do 2 roles where he was burned out? Why take out Carrasco and have an ineffective LW? We had some chances especially the Correa chance. We will face Levante again at hone while missing more players, face Chelsea in Bucharest after three days, Villareal away where the last win was in 2015 away, Derby game where we did not win at home in La Liga since 2015. I am starting to get very nervous",gnsytnt,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 04:25:59,mos1992,5
"We need to put this game in context. The squad is bare thin. 10/11 players have played 90 minutes in each of our last 3 games. Everyone out there looks absolutely exhausted. 

Let’s also not forget that we’ve pulled off wins with a last minute miracle more than once this season. So yes, the gap is shrinking but being in the same league as Barça and Real we shouldn’t expect to win the title by 13 points. Barça will slip a little here and there, so will Real, and we’ll get a bit more luck next game and be right back on track.",gnszk2t,lm33c6,atletico,2021-02-18 04:31:22,grandeoblak,7

"Really disappointing to give up a late goal like that, would have been so awesome to get the 3 points in a game where Atleti was severely undermanned.

"A big positive of the match for me is the 4-4-2 with Kondo, Torreira, and Lodi all playing very well. 

Llorente not so good as a right-back but it isn't' surprising. I think he's being wasted playing as RWB and RB but circumstances demand it. 

The defense has been a letdown for a few games now and it's sad to see. 

We were bound to drop points and we still could drop more given what is happening at the club. The league is not sealed yet with Barcelona bouncing back with Messi and doing really well again.

"Hate to have dropped points. But I think we can agree, it was a fair result. We were horrible in the first half. We made for it in the second half though. Almost a Cholo masterclass with the change in formation at halftime. Literally springing Lodi &amp; Kondogbia to life, who were absent in the first half. Suarez got limited opportunities and he made the most of it. No complaints. Llorente showing how versatile he is. But it highlights two important issues - Vrsaljko is clearly under performing. Other players have to play out of position for that, and somewhere our defense is also taking a hit because of this. Secondly, we *NEED* Trippier ASAP. Koke &amp; Saul were fine imo. Infact, I was happy to see flashes of the good ol' creative Saul. Torreira also made the most of the opportunity. Did everything possible. Back defending, good link up play. Let's also not forget that we were totally depleted. Players out of position, almost no substitution options, so keeping everything in mind, this could've been worse, especially looking at how things started. Atleast we didn't lose and picked up a point. All in all fair result. Kono, Torreira &amp; Lodi showing they can be useful if formation is favourable which is also okay, not everyone can be as adaptive as Koke. WE NEED TO BE FULL STRENGTH FOR MATCHES AHEAD. It simply cannot go like today. Contain the outbreak, or delay the matches further, but spare the humiliation. We finally have some chance to win something. Let's not bottle it. Aupa Atleti! Onwards and upwards.",gmmp0cb,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 06:07:15,ak5effect,11
"Not the best outcome but a fair result. We didn’t have a good first half and those careless moments are where you concede.

I just wasn’t impressed by the idea of putting Koke out wide again, he hasn’t been playing there for long and obviously he takes time to adjust as the defensive duties are so different. He left that guy ran for free.

Lodi and Kondogbia revived from the terrible first half, sometimes 442 can be our weapon as we can freely switch between 2 tactics now. 

Hats off to Suarez for doing it once again.

We really need to be more composed in the end of the match. We could’ve kept the ball, play it round and get it through final whistle. Also the defence needs to wake up, conceding way too much recently.

All in all. It isn’t a bad result considering how many players we missed. Still, we need to play better to keep the momentum going. Aupa Atleti.",gmmoe1u,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 06:02:32,1ngK,7
"Hopefully Lemar, Carrasco, and Hermoso will be back soon enough. Aside from Suarez goal, not a fun match to watch tbh.

Kondogbia is pretty impressive today despite his mistake. While I feel Simeone should put Vrsaljko at RB and Llorente in front of him instead of Llorente RB and Saul RM. Llorente talent is wasted there while Saul despite his killer left foot, is just not good going forward",gmmnupi,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 05:58:27,rainsong94,4

"I love Oblak but he's not playing his best games lately. Idon't think that a single one of his long goal kicks ended up with an Atlético player, it was either for Celta or out.

Still the best keeper in the world for me, but I hope he gets out of this slump.",gmmor28,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 06:05:17,handanu,5

That was an extremely frustrating match. Had a chance to take 3 points despite not playing so well and ended with a draw. Not a terrible result given our situation but the W was right thereeee,gmmnm8a,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 05:56:42,Full_Metal93,7
"I'll take a draw from such a hectic game, but we were underwhelming. Disappointed in Josema and the defense as a whole for this performance. Ditto for Felipe and Torreira. 

This game has also convinced me that neither Koke nor Saul has the pace to fully play out wide anymore, and that Cholo should've subbed on Sime to slot in at RB and pushed Llorente -- who, frankly, was caught out of position many times -- forward. 

On a positive note, Kondogbia came alive in the 2nd and slots in perfectly in a double pivot. I'm hopeful for his future performances.",gmmo4fa,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 06:00:30,herro_preeeze,3

"It was an awful day from the beginning with Covid news and the squad as short as it is. We started the game with the wrong formation and payed a hefty price in the first half as we were invisible. It was brilliance from Suarez and Llorente to get the goal to draw the game. Second half it was the right substitute and change of formation. We scored and we were better most of the half. However, I do not understand why there were no more substitutions? We also could have created and scored more. Defensively again same errors we do not stop crosses especially from the left, Celta attackers breaking in the heart of our defense were having a vacation today. Awful communication and action by the defensive structure. We are supposed to win all home games!! We are coming against mid table away games and these games are must win games because after that we will play top teams like Villareal and the derby, games where we can easily lose points. Hopefully today was just a one off but the defense is worrying.",gmmp4em,lfmxrs,atletico,2021-02-09 06:08:06,mos1992,2
"I'm happy that we have a run of 5 games all within the next 2 and half weeks, its a big wake up call that we are about to enter the final 3rd of the season. These next 5 games will be vita to win as they determine the rest of the season for us, if Carrasco, Hermoso, Joao, Dembele are available by Granada we can do it for sure.

1. I just make a text post and link the goals in there. A bit janky but it'll work.

"A very entertaining game. Both teams are somewhat lucky and unlucky at the same time lol.

Suarez with our first free kick goal ever since Griezmann scored his last at almost 2 years ago. Unfortunately Suarez still can't get his hat trick, but he just keeps making the difference.

Lemar and Saul put up a good performance. Koke as well. 

Felix really needs to step up his game, he can't be a guaranteed starter just because his price, he needs to prove himself worthy to start ahead of Correa or others. Look at how Correa impressed in 30 minutes, created a lot and assisted again.

Unfortunate for Oblak today, but man still had good saves and bailing us!

"Just watched Tuchel's pre match press conference. He was saying that he expects a very similar game as in the first leg, he thinks that a 1-0 score isn't enough to make atleti change their style. When asked about if he thinks that atleti will play more offensively tomorrow, he said that every team has their DNA, and that atleti's dna is an organized and disciplined defense, that we mainly rely on our defense to win games.

On the other hand, Cholo kept talking about how there is one option and one option only for atleti: to win. This combined with the way we've been playing recently, I feel like we're gonna start strong and very offensive and i think theyre gonna be surprised by it cause of the fact tgat they think that atleti still parks the bus every game.

"Obviously we’re a goal down but we’re going into this with a slight advantage. Scoring 2 goals is the same as scoring 3. All we need is two goals and I’d say that we can hunker down and play defensively. However, we need to play our absolute fucking asses off to got though. If we don’t get this game exactly right, we risk loosing it. 

However, I strongly believe that we can do it. In fact I know we can. If come out guns blazing and just play like we did against real, then we can do this, however if we come out and play with 10 men behind the ball again, it’s over. 

The key to this match is FINISHING OUR CHANCES and not making any dumb mistakes that cost us goals. Our defense has been leaky, and has shown signs of failure. This cannot happen. We need to start Felix over Correa, and have Dembele on the bench and waiting for his 20 minutes up top. 

All I want is a strong 3-1 or 2-0 victory and go through. Nothing less than victory is acceptable. AUPA ATLETI.",gr4vwzm,m6b5sr,atletico,2021-03-17 00:05:11,AtleticoFan17,19

"Honestly really looking forward to this game. It's a game that we have to attack from the get go, heavily rewarded for scoring a second goal because of away goal rules, and don't have too much to loose. Really excited to see what the team is capable once it takes the shackles off. Chelsea will also hopefully still be without Thiago Silva (?), and their defence looked shaky especially during the few times we pressed high in the last game, but they've got some players who are really good on the counter.

Win or loose I just hope it will be a great game and we get to see a full force Atleti, really hope we don't score one and slow down hoping to nick a second or go to extra time (or just play a bizarre counter-attacking/defensive style that makes no sense to the fans), and either way I'm hoping it will be pivotal for the season in a good way - if we lose, it'll be the kick up the backside the team needs to get out of this bad run of form, and allow us to focus fully on La Liga - if we win, it'll show the team what they can do when they just believe in themselves and fully go for it and play to dominate and win.

It is a very tough game and hoping for a good show and attitude more than the result. Tomorrow will be a test for what we are made of or not. It is important to mark the front trio for Chelsea very well. We will get chances Tomorrow and we should take them because wasting chances in this game is unforgivable. We do not have excuses this game for injuries or suspensions like last game and we need something to boost our confidence like Anfield last year.

"Here's an idea..Start Dembele in the next match and then sub in Suarez around 50-60th..That way, Suarez will be able to deal with the slowed down opponents and be there with fresher legs leveling the playing field..

Dembele looked good, but I'd like to remind you that he was facing a similar problem this season for Lyon, where he was getting into great positions inside the box but his finishing was off.. If he continues on like this for us, I'd rather we have Morata back as at least I'm used to him or us just going after a new prospect..

Felix and Lemar need to start..I think they were on the bench most probably for the Chelsea match..

Correa can not handle pressure, most of his good performances this season have come when he is subbed in while we are already winning or we have a great momentum going on and he is subbed in..

I think its time to find a new role for Saul..I think instead of playing him next to Koke, Simieone should train him for the Koke role so he can replace him in later stages of the game and also when Koke won't be available..If all goes well, Saul can take over the captain armband from Koke once he retires.. I think it will take him a year if he starts transitioning now..

Llorente can't be expected to light up the screens all the time..

Carrasco seriously needs to work on his finishing..I just get so frustrated whenever he takes a shot..The keeper never requires alot of effort to save the shot..


I hope we don't blow away all the precious work we put into holding the lead this season.. Only a couple more games to go so hopefully we win this with dignity rather than lose without any..",gquruie,m4gg4a,atletico,2021-03-14 09:04:48,iamtheone11111,7

"Fuck it man, this game frustrates the fuck out of me. 

Extremely sloppy because Getafe will find a way to stop the play every 30 seconds. You just can’t waste big chances against them. 

Everything looked good but we did very poor in the final third. And Dembele, man, he could’ve had a hat trick. Don’t wanna sound too harsh but he should’ve scored at least 1. But still, he looked good and needs to play more.

It just isn’t our day. Everything is off by Avery small margin. Suarez beats Soria but got denied by the post, Felix scored but the ball was out of play for centimetres. Soria playing like a mad man.

Correa, Correa, Correa. This guy frustrates the fuck out of me every single match. Llorente cleaning up after multiple messes from Koke and Trippier. Oblak with an unusual error.

5. We have important games against good opposition where we need attacking players on good form, how are these players going to find their form if they never play full games?

"Why u all acting so negative, tbh, I’m ok with this result, we didn’t give Real a chance to reduce the gap between us and them, and I doubt that Barca has the consistency to win all the games left, Real is the true threat here, and now they didn’t get a chance to get 3 points, of course, it sux to concede a ball at 88 min, but all hope is not lost, we should focus on athletic Bilbao now",gq5kylz,lzrrsm,atletico,2021-03-08 07:46:40,Guitarist39,1
"I have no idea why I’m seeing such negativity about the entire season based on just this game. We are in first brothers, on a normal year we wouldn’t even be in the title race at this point in the season. Obviously, it’s frustrating to draw against la real so late. Feels like a loss. It hurts, but wtf we are still in the lead, we still have a game in hand, calm the fuck down. Some of you act like the season is over, like we should just rid ourselves of Felix and others because they deserve a better team. Our Atleti is one of the best in the world, we are more than capable of fielding such a talent. Disgusting to see such lack of faith in Cholo and the boys at this point.

"I don’t want to be the one but I really do think Simeone himself is the main reason if we do lose the league somehow. Not that it’s unlikely anyway cuz Barca doesn’t seem to drop any points and the fact that we HAVE to win at Camp Nou to secure the league.

It happened very often since December that he got the tactic/lineup wrong and we fucked up in the first half that defined the game. Yesterday was just another example, and it hurts even more as Bilbao didn’t have some starters like Munian and Yuri, while being in an absolutely shit form after losing back to back finals and haven’t win for weeks.

And don’t forget that had Simeone didn’t go to defend for its sake we could’ve sat in a position affordable to such loss. Especially the home game vs Real, jeez that still hurts.

Perhaps the best chance ever to win the league, and now it comes to a situation we must win Barca in Camp Nou for the title. Not that I don’t have belief in our team but it’s just saddening to see how we fucked up this hard. Doesn’t help that players at times can play like they touch the ball for the first time with some atrocious touches and passes in away games like yesterday.

Ok I’m still mad after all, like super mad.

Edit: A slight hope is that some most important starters are on 4 yellows for Barca, if the likes of Messi/Griez/De Jong can't feature against Valencia or us, it can be the highest chance for them to drop points.",gvvxjeg,myikug,atletico,2021-04-26 10:27:32,1ngK,8
"Cholo recognized in the press conference after the match that the team played bad in the first half because of his inability to solve the issues the team faces to play as they've planned during the week, likewise with the other lot of times this had happened.

Now, for the sake of debating, my take on this is that sometimes Simeone makes some tactical choices based more on pure feeling of the team rather than reasoning, and sometimes it backfires. For example:

- On this match he used the same starting XI from the last two matches (except Giménez) because that formation did pretty well and the players were doing good, so there was no need to start with Lemar, Joao and Suarez whom just have trained one or two days after their injuries and they probably were better entering in the 2nd half. In the end, Marcelino came prepared to overcome the lineup of the last matches with his tactics combined with the ability of his players and he came victorious.



-  When he makes defensive substitutions when there's not really a need for them because, his words, if you didn't scored in the first 80 minutes you won't do it in the last 10. I keep thinking that belief ended up defining the tie against Real, because the only reason we were dominating them was because they didn't had any space to attack while being busy with our front players. The moment we went to defend, they surely gained more space and confidence which ended on them scoring their goal in the last minutes. 

So, my idea is that what he lacks is to put aside some feelings in some of his choices and try more to face the threats with strategies based on the facts of the match. But I don't know, is just an idea based on what I've seen during the season. Sometimes we were just unlucky as well.",gvvejbh,myikug,atletico,2021-04-26 07:30:57,FrkM,6

That option is no longer available (unless Barca mess up their game in hand). There is no hiding now. Even if Barca win against Granada, it is still in our hands. 

Barca and Sociedad aside, we have arguably the ""easier"" fixture compared to RM and Barca.

He again switched Llorente to RB which is an instant defeat. Carrasco was awful today and he stayed on the field. Due to switching Carrasco to Llorente's position our left side was not well utilised and the balance of the team was out of place.

Correa is still in his amazing form and I hope he stays the like this for the last 6. Second half we started well but by 15 minutes we were losing the possession and our rhythm and if Huesca scored we could have struggled very much. It is not going to be easy against our next opponents away especially: Barcelona and Athletic Club. I thought the subs were a little late.  We finally capitalized on our chance and scored the second. Hopefully also Moussa Dembele can get in form and starts to score, his runs and positioning in the field are good but he needs to shoot better.

Hope he gets to stay up front when the bigger names return, because it's a shame to see him getting more clumsy when having to run all those extra miles and slowing his legs and brain, like anyone would.

"Loving the fluidity of the entire team, really enjoying the front three and the fluid midfield three (even if saul needs to step up a bit) Lodi’s having another immense game.

Only problem is the final decision making and finishing - I think correa is playing great but he gives us more of what we’re getting from Llorente and Carrasco, whereas I feel we need somebody who’s more of a ‘finisher’. 

If we get felix back before Suarez, I would love to see him playing as a false 9 with Llorente and Carrasco on either side - I feel like that could be the missing puzzle piece in making this “4-3-3” fly

I was only 7 when he joined the club but I have very fond memories of watching as my grandad was pissed that a Uruguayan was doing such great things in Europe. It was at that point I fell in love with Atletico and their underdog story as I myself was never good at futbol and so I had some small attachment in my heart with them as I watched as they worked their way up. Then when cholo took over my relationship for him and his defensive tactics grew even more. My life in terms of glory was always Barcelona but the things Atletico did especially not being as Elite as Barcelona at the time really made me love them as a club.😔 From the UCL Finals to the 2014 league title, players like griezmann and Saul and more players I could relate to as I reached my teenage years I’ve always had a soft spot when it comes to Atletico and thus watching them join the ESL made me realize that we have become an Elite club and there’s nothing I can do about it as I watch them then the sport and club I loved become a Business and wanting more money.",gv5eawq,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 08:53:21,TheCruzOf00,17

I will not watch any Super League games, if it were to happen. If they're expelled from LaLiga over it, I will not watch any Atletico games nor show my support until they either leave the Super League, Cerezo/Gil Marin are ejected from the club or the Super League is shut down. I'm not sure what I'd do if the ESL goes through with Atletico still in LaLiga. 

These clubs don't give a shit if we quit and change allegiance, they want that to happen so that the people with any idea of the ethos of this club are gone and don't make as much noise.

To think no other fan would ever get to experience that, because of our clubs greed along with a handful of others just sickens me. The fact that we are even associated with Flo and his ridiculously patronizing comments about the league also sickens me

I don’t get who this league is for other than owners who want to secure a yearly paycheque. 

If you actually wanted to be in a competition with the top teams in Europe, it would need to be opened up to much more leagues.

Nobody deserves to play in European competitions, not us, not Real, Not even a club like Bayern (I know they’re not in UCL, I’m making a point). As someone whose stuck by the club since 2010, no one would love to see the club that we love play in the biggest competition with the best teams in the game than me. But today the team let me down, I feel betrayed because this goes against our philosophy as club, to work hard and earn our position a team to be taken seriously. 

I will continue to support the club in spirit, but I don’t think I can bring myself to actually watch any games that would take place in ESL, although by the looks of it The other leagues are considering removing the participating teams from their leagues, so who knows what’ll happen. In that same vein I don’t think I could bring myself to switch teams. Atléti were the first team I fell in love with and to switch teams would just feel wrong",gv68hb5,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 13:54:59,ThatGuy_ASDF,3
"Is not about identify yourself as a worker people. It sounds dumb imo, but the thing is to see a team that is for and by the fans doing this rat movement of stabbing your league, the main institution of the european cup for earning more money. That's disgusting and this cannot be. Atletico, Barcelona and Real Madrid must to be punished.

Furthermore, I don't see any logic to support the club meanwhile is playing in a greedy league. Is nonsense, basically you are supporting that league watching it. So, I'll support Atleti if rejects Super league, but with a proper punishment. Meanwhile they play there I won't.

Is this the time to move to bundles league?",gv6jt4k,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 16:46:49,elBorsho,3

"Been a fan since childhood, thanks to my father, first season I have clear memories of is 1999/2000 when we got relegated. I’m really sad and disappointed that the club is joining the Super League, it’s like they’ve forgotten our roots, where we come from, etc.

That being said, I for better or worse will still follow them...Atleti is the club of my life and I couldn’t imagine following sports without supporting them...it’s very hard to break a relationship with a club you support, even when they do stuff you disagree with...it’s like an addiction 😅",gv61u4l,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 12:32:18,SunOfInti_92,4

"I honestly don’t know what to say. It is such a shame that Atleti could take part in something as disgraceful as this. For those saying that it’s good because we’re proving that we’re a top dog fuck off. This isn’t what it’s about. 

Who cares if we’ve proven we’re one of the best teams in Europe, that doesn’t mean we deserve to always be in a Super League where we can’t be relegated. We have to earn it with our performances. It’s stupid, unfair, biased. What are clubs supposed to fight for now? Why do Tottenham and Arsenal have a right to be in a supposed Super League but not Ajax, Porto, etc. They can’t even qualify for the CL but they deserve to be in an elite breakaway league? Nah I can’t with this shit. 

The Atleti players have to do something to stop it. Refuse to play or something. That would prove that they truly have love for the game. Football is about earning your places and glory through hard work and talent not given millions of dollars to buy it. Absolutely shameful by the owners and if the players don’t say anything against it then shame on them too.",gv7b3pi,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 22:05:34,_RodMan_,2
"Money isnt the problem. Of course I wanna see Atleti grow financially and compete with the top teams and all that. Controversially, I dont blame Atleti for joining. I mean think about it, imagine that you own the club and youre struggling financially during the pandemic. Some dudes in suits walk in the door and tell you that theyll offer you billions of euros to join a league consisting of Europe's top teams, and that all the other clubs have already agreed to it. Of course you'd take it. Its not about thinking that we're entitled and better than everyone else, that we're not the people's club. We're in financial crisis and in the business world, its every man for himself. Times are changing and football is changing too, it doesnt have to be a problem. I feel like everyone is bashing the superleague without actually being educated enough. They say ""money is ruining the game. money this money that"" ""this is not the people's club anymore, its just a business"". Money isnt the problem folks, money keeps the game alive. If done right, every team in the pyramid could financially benefit from the Superleague. They have to agree on, clarify, and change a couple of things tho. The problem for me with the Superleague is the discrimination towards the smaller clubs. The fact that there could be no relegation from the founding teams. The Superleage could be an amazing amazing thing for everyone involved if they create two leagues. Basically Division 1 and Division 2. Teams from Division 1 can get relegated to division 2 and teams from division 2 can get promoted to division 1. This will create more popularity not only for the big teams, but for the average teams in the 2nd division as well. Each domestic league will go on with the small teams continuing their dreams to play for Europe's big stage. They can get promoted to the div 2 of the super league through winning their domestic league or through a playoff. Everyone wins like this. Its not just about money, its about making a system that fits everyone. Now its up to Florentino Perez and co. if they wanna be smart and unselfish about it. Also, UEFA, FIFA, the ESL, and the domestic leagues have to work together and agree on something. There cant be both champions league and super league. And if the super league plan pushes through, they should definitely create a system that benefits every single team in the pyramid. Regardless of if there is a super league or not, my love for Atleti is untouched. I know that a lot of fans are pissed off right now, but no way am I changing my love for our club.

"I guess it’s easier for me since I’ve become less hardcore and started viewing this business more for what it is, an entertainment business.

In theory I wouldn’t mind a European league, but not like this. I understand the financial reasoning for it, though. The protest is there now, and somehow way way bigger than the protesting against the circumstances in ie Qatar over the past decade. But I guess people tend to perceive mostly what hits close to home or their personal experience, possibly crumbling down, taking on new forms. But in the end, I don’t see the boycotts taking on big forms. So all in all the risk seems to be worth it for them.

But while I already watch less, I don’t think I’d consciously join such a boycott if the shift actually happens. But I watch like two-three games of football a year now anyways so it’s not like I’ll make a difference.

But in honesty, I’m not against change at all, but the no relegation? I understand the fear of financial loss, but there’s too much (very direct) history to suddenly turn yourself into an MLS type system. So if a club won’t open their asses for your idea they don’t get to play? Criticize uefa and fifa all you want - like we all should - but you’re turning into a more extreme version of them if you’ll go all dictator about your league.

But then again it’s entertainment business, I support some smaller clubs too, like Cadiz and I live in the non participating NL so I’m not just a blind sheep. But it’s entertainment and I am fairly neutral in the matter because I also don’t want to care too much. Sometimes I want to watch as a form of relaxation or excitement and as of late I want to keep my stress at things that are bigger priorities in my life.

I think that’s a possible reason more people are neutral ish. It’s unfair, especially without possible promotion and its tastes of shared dictatorship rule by the big 12, and I/we hope this won’t affect the smaller clubs too horribly. But there’s so much horror in the world that we can’t all focus it on football.

Also it’s the first proposal, we’ll probably see a less extreme version later on it the discussions.",gv6kt9t,muekqu,atletico,2021-04-20 17:03:51,barrieherry,1

Think about it, no-one expected us to win that 2014 la liga. Our players and Cholo out of sheer grit, determination, fought tooth and nail so that we could get hands on silverware. We very recently have attained the ""big club"" status. We never had money but still made it big to a point that we're now valued at 1 billion. If a team like Getafe, Villareal, Cadiz were to win the cup purely out of their hard work and determination, it would be another beautiful story of football. But with the way things are going, can something like this happen ? Maybe not. 


The broad point is, football these days has become so much about money, people are rarely investing into domestic or U19 talents. Players don't develop and even teams don't. The current system too doesn't help much and financial fair play is a joke. But the ESL is a slap on the faces of all the so called smaller clubs. We out of all the clubs should understand this as we too were a small club and we made it big. We shouldn't trample on other clubs. Let's revamp the existing system ( it is needed big time. UEFA too sits on a shitload of money. Now just because there's a new entrant, they're feeling threatened)",gv264hv,mtumgv,atletico,2021-04-19 16:22:46,ak5effect,15

I was born in 2000 at that time we were competing in the fucking Segunda. I don't care about our recent success. Every club has a natural life-cycle of ups and downs and this super league removes the merit of fair competition and the essence of modern football.

"Hi, long time since I posted something, a lot of bad shit happened to me :(

This is the last nail in the coffin. I will support Atleti always, even in this fucking super league. But, this is just what started to happen since 1984 when Gil stole the club and made it a company (the SAD transformation) and we the fans, the supporters, THE PEOPLE, were no longer part of the board and started to be just Atleti consumers.

Some people fought the thieves, and justice was called but NEVER WAS SERVED. So here we are, with an illegal ownership taking decisions about OUR CLUB and its destiny just looking for their own personal profit. It's not even the club's profit. And we can only sit and watch.

I will not say something like ""I will not support this club anymore"", no, because I can't do it. I have seen a poll about how much the fans agreed with the super league and it was R. Madrid 54% yes 46% no, Barcelona 57% yes 43% no, Atletico 14% yes 86% no. There is a huge gap between our fanbase and what our board wants. Since they stole the club many times was said that they don't represent us and how much we want them out in any way even if they get rich in the process but the club finally reach its freedom.

The love for the club it's not going to disappear, it didn't happen when we got relegated, and in all those years wandering in the desert. It didn't change with horrible jerseys (thank you Nike...) or the fucking logo. Or taking vikingos in and have to cheer for them... Atleti is more than that, and maybe that's even a reason why we support this club.

""Diles que se vayan"", so many times. Not even in his wildest dreams, MAG could imagine that one day he was going to be in the top12 getting hundreds of millions when what he used to do was buy and sell shitty players and get a percentage and stole a few millions every season from the club.

If Don Vicente Calderón were alive and president, he will never take part in this shit without voting for it. Take a look at how Florentino and Laporta (Bartomeu before) made all of this without asking the people, they went full ""the club is mine"" mode.
We don't have a president who wants the better for the club or who represents the club hence he will do whatever he wants and fuck us.

That summer, Florentino Perez became president, signing every player in Europe (Ronaldo, Kaka, etc) and already starting to agitate for more money for the top 2 in Spain, as well as a European SuperLeague (This is an old idea).

As someone who identifies with working people, I thought this was disgusting and as a young person I started to question this club that I thought I was a fan of. I figured I was only glory-hunting by watching this team and that its values didn't actually bring me any joy.

I started to watch Atletico Madrid from then on, and watched through Quique Sanchez Flores, Manzano, and then Simeone becoming more and more enamored with the idea that we fought like hell and that we were proud of not being like Them, meaning we didn't think that winning at all costs was the way to live.

But I find it hard to imagine jumping ship based on the actions of the guys in suits. Hell, I already dislike the owners of my favorite baseball and basketball teams, welcome to the club Atleti.

It's been made quite clear throughout Europe that these decisions all seem to have been made exclusively behind the scenes. Some situations have even showed a glaring level of intentional deceit to hide it from staff and players. It seems safe to assume this would be true of our situation as well, to some extent. I can't imagine any staff or players are on board with this.

There's huge media manipulation going on over the news of this announcement. There's billions at stake and the future of the sport in general.

Especially since many of these ""reporters"" will write literally about anything. Just look at how much false information gets ""leaked"" every transfer season. All of this is a mess. I say try it and see. The new champions league format is drastically different. I think big clubs don't want to be forced into playing that many games. They rather just split and do their own games if that's the case and keep the money to themselves. Right now UEFA and FIFA have told the clubs ""dance monkey DANCE"" and the clubs said ""no"".

•The relationship between the ESL clubs and UEFA is extremely lopsided, because it’s easily UEFA who benefit most out of this relationship by a large margin. They need Madrid, Barcelona, Man Utd, etc. MUCH more than the other way around. UEFA have not had to worry about putting in the work to generate attention to their product because their cash cows do it for them. Let’s just be honest and keep it 💯 here. 

• The relationship between these big clubs and their respective domestic leagues is pretty much the same dynamic as listed above.

• UEFA and the domestic leagues (except the EPL somewhat) never gave much attention to other clubs besides the handful of elite ones, never helped promote or build the brands of those clubs, etc. and now it’s biting them in the ass.

I saw a stat, that no team had ever thrown away the league lead that atletico had at the halfway point of the season to go on to lose the title, but this is surely a record-breaking season in that regard.

I want for simeone to succeed with Atleti, after all he's done, but this constant reverting to conservative tactics doesn't work. this is not the 2014-16 team. Lodi, Felix, Hermoso, Suarez, are not Turan, Griezmann, prime Costa, Godin, playing that way simply doesn't fit this team, and forcing them to try to adapt to these tactics will not work

Over the last 3 or so months, we have looked like a team fighting for Europa league. Do not even try to deny it. Getting last minute goals scored against us, terrible games where it takes Oblak saving a penalty to secure a win over relegation sides, 0-0 draws with 14th place teams.

This is unacceptable. This is 13 points gone from our top spot in the league, fucking 2 months ago. That’s some garbage form. Yeah we have had some bad luck, but a title winning team, battles through bad luck and gets the result anyway. 

Barcelona decimated La Real like it wasn’t even funny. And we’re here, desperately trying to claw our points back and not even getting a goal against Sevilla who weren’t even that great today.

I don’t want to hear about injuries, or suspensions, or illness. 

13 points ahead of Real Madrid 2 months ago. If Barcelona win the Derby the league is over. That’s essentially what it is at this point. Because Barcelona will beat us at the Nou camp unless we get our fucking act together and finish this league off by winning against them and Betis.

But now the mountain is even higher to climb due to Llorente and Suarez being out of the Betis game. 

We’re about to completely throw the title away. Not just throw it away, but hand it down to Barcelona by getting complacent and not giving a flying fuck about the latter half of the season.

Playing without Felix and Carrasco made us so poor on the ball and lacked creativity. Hope they will return for the next match, otherwise we may duck up hard once again. We need them to carry us next match.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry back to the post now , the midfield  barely made two good passes together today  . too easily shrugged off the ball, no physical presence in the midfield to express themselves freely  , and I'm not only talking about just this match but previous games . the attack and defense should get criticized also but I believe that having a good and dictating midfield that can transition defense into attack smoothly to link up with the strikers make a difference . I'm not seeing those qualities in saul, koke , HH as of late .. the others are OK . I also blame the tactics . What Diego Simeone should realize that this isn't the same atleti with solid prime players such as Griezmann ,prime costa,  godin  etc.. by the end of the season , i want to see answers to my 2 questions

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will Simeone put his feelings aside for some players and get rid of some of the deadwood?
2. if or when atleti falls from first position, What will be the club board's reaction? will they pressure Diego to win trophies more? or are they content with finishing in top 4 UCL spots and earning ucl qualification money ?",gtealrs,mk4p1p,atletico,2021-04-05 07:21:15,defensiveminded2020,-2

So many managerial changes for the big clubs this season,gzmca33,njikx2,atletico,2021-05-27 18:18:37,randomcolchnero,2
"Striker options:

Lukaku: He's the perfect striker and probably the best from his era.. Inter also plays with a 3-5-2 so he can slot right in.. Plus he helped Lautaro unleash his potential so could work up a great partnership with Felix or Correa.. Inter also need to sell thi summer so we could get him if we can get some money ready.. Will cost us around 30m + Moratta's sale

Son: I just love the guy and he seems like he wants to win trophies and move out of Spurs.. If Harry kane leaves, his departure would be looking more likely as well..Although he plays as a LM, he has played CF as well, is clinical and also very fast..

Moreno: Cheapest of the bunch and not that much of a drop in quality.. Although the question would be whether he would want to move out of Villareal before experiencing CL with them.. Villareal president has expressed that he doesn't want to sell players but rather improve their side, which I think would be best for them by appointing Emery for a longer term and getting to Sevilla level in the league would be good for everyone in Laliga..

Andre Silva: Bangs in lots of goals but tbh I haven't watched him play alot so can't really tell you if he would fit what we are looking for..

Depay: If he doesn't go to Barca we should snatch him up.. Hes really really good and can play a bunch of positions.. His goals are as good as his assists.. Although he's been playing as a false 9 lately, he can play as a normal striker too..

Dembele: He didn't score any for us but I also feel like he didn't get the playtime and looked quite good whenever he came on and so close to scoring.. But I think his form would be an issue and he would be a sub to Suarez while the others can hold to their own..


What do you guys think..?? Which of these would be ideal and feel free to add any players i might have missed..",gzly4uw,njikx2,atletico,2021-05-27 14:39:03,iamtheone11111,3

"I am an Italian guy from Florence, I went to Madrid to visit my brother in late 2018. He was doing his Erasmus in the city, living near La Latina, and it was a great trip because I fell in love with the city.
I have always been a Fiorentina supporter, I have always been more fascinated by underdog stories and I have never supported the more powerful and famous teams, so when I had to decide whether to plan my visit when Atletico or Real were playing it was quite an easy choice.
I went to see a beautiful Atletico-Atheltic that finished 3-2 with Godin scoring the winner with a header in the final minutes of the game, and since then I have become a fan of the team. I have followed closely this season and I feared that Atletico could lose the Liga in April, but when I saw Suarez scoring the 2-1 goal today I was as excited as I rarely have been in the last year.
Considering that I support Fiorentina in Italy I can rarely celebrate trophies, and this La Liga win for me is huge.
A great thank to Atletico for letting me have a great moment, and sorry if the post might appear too melodramatic but I am really happy for this title.",gz2vj6z,nio3x8,atletico,2021-05-23 02:20:21,Camus95,49

Carrasco came back from freaking China and won La Liga now that's sweet........ HOLY CRAP Oblak finally has a La liga ......... LLorente won La Liga I'm so happy for him...  Lemar too just going through all the players and thinking, oh wow, he's a La Liga winner now.

If Real Madrid lost their final game (and they were losing til the 87th min), we would've finished 5 points clear at the top, but still it feels great to silence all of the haters who thought we'd screw it up in the end!",gz7e2e8,nio3x8,atletico,2021-05-24 05:27:21,itypeallmycomments,3

"Not the best approach starting the game as defensively we were not very comfortable. Valladolid looked like they wanted to control the game and sometimes they would play on the counter which hurt us. After they scored our game plan was disrupted and we could not penetrate their defense except with set pieces, which needs work. In the second half we got control of the ball again and started to go in between their defense and we were able to score. Valladolid played a higher line and were trying to attack us which led to their error and it only takes a genius like Suarez to score accurately. Last minutes we defended well but could have done more offensively but we did what we needed to do and won the game and the title!!

Valladolid owner (Ronaldo) announced reward of sort if they beat Atletico, I think it's more to do with escaping relegation than crowning madrid as champion.

"After a long season this is it. This is the game which can define legends or regular players. Not only for us but for Valladolid who need a miracle to not go down. I expect Valladolid to be offensive this game to save themselves and we need to take advantage of this and score. Valladolid game away is usually a struggle and it is not easy to win at their stadium for our team. 
Savic not starting means we will play with Josema and Felipe. I hope they play a good game defensively, do not play a very high line and stop counters. Offensively we need to stop wasting chances and stop being selfish. If we kill the game early in the first half like La Real against them last week and If we play in a moderate way, relaxed and in a collaborative way we should win this.",gyzj738,nhesjw,atletico,2021-05-22 05:02:54,mos1992,2

"Anyone else feel like the Llorente/Trippier combination may have lost its magic?

It’s a small sample size, but I liked having Carrasco on the right side with Trippier. This freed up space for Joao and Lodi on the left side, who combined for the first goal, and allowed Carrasco and Trippier to combine for the second goal.

For the next match, I’d be interested in seeing Joao and Lodi/Hermoso on the left and Carrasco/Trippier on the right to start. I’d still want Llorente on the field of course, and then maybe bring Saul on for Joao around the 70’ mark.

"This match was crazy. One moment, it seemed like everything was lost. Simeone making some panic substitutions.

By then some people had given up. But I kept thinking the words of Dutch van der Linde from RDR2: ""Have some goddamn faith!""

Then a few minutes later, a lifeline from Lodi, making up for his mistakes that caused the conceded goal.

Then, pure ecstasy when no other than Luis Suarez himself finally stepped up to score a crucial goal.

Those were the craziest few minutes of the season, crazier than that match against Elche. A clutch performance from Atleti.

Now we just have to beat Valladolid. If Real Sociedad can destroy them 4-0, I believe we can as well. It would be an ecstatic finish to the season.

Although the win feels very good but we missed a ton of chances which could have made this game much easier and in the next game we will not have the same privilege since we will be facing a team fighting for their lives.

"My god, I was thinking I got all equanimity about football 1-2 weeks ago but this experience was intense. We got behind, Real ahead (I was checking through livescore) and fudge it was a dread. But this is better. Barça is out of the picture, kind of as expected (is it me or are they always on a bad spell when Pique gets back into their team?), but still nice. Hoped Athletic could've helped us, but I saw Villarreal is their next opponent. While last game and title deciding pressure throws all statistics out of the window, I do think this means we should be absolute favorites now. I wished a draw would be enough, I wished Real didn't score that one wretched goal, to have a nice last round coming in, but alas.

"So happy we got the win today, buy it was much closer than it needed to be, we were very unlucky, I mean 21 shots, 9 on target, 2 posts and 2 offsides. 

I also felt that we were under a lot of scrutiny, even though I try not to blame the ref it is difficult when they don't even check the time Suarez went down in the box, which led to osasunas goal. I mean we didn't even get a replay of it. 

I also think that the offside check after the first real atlatico goal was way too long and waste of time by the ref, when Lodi was like 2 m onside.

Also it made no sense that they add 5 minutes of extra time when there literally have been no stops other than goals and goal checks. And the ref even had osasuna have a last chance at 6 minutes Into extra time, when oblak had kicked it away.

It is just my opinion, but I feel it is difficult not to fall into the real Madrid biased referees conspiracies:((",gydaskm,ndui8z,atletico,2021-05-17 05:20:44,oben_yalfan,1

"Vitolo brings little to nothing to our team. He’s nowhere near good enough to play for us. He’s an average player on huge wages at an ambitious club. Vitolo would struggle to start at Cadiz, Huesca, and Eibar, let alone Atletico. 

I also fail to see how Vrsalko still improves our team. At this point he’s in the same boat as Vitolo. He sits on the bench and every 5 games he gets 15 minutes of play time. He was great in the past but Trippier outshines him like day and night. Not good enough to start, not even really great at being a squad player. Back when Trippier was banned for 10 games, we had to have Llorente play there because Vrsalko was so painfully bland at RB that he barely did anything.",gy8vis2,ncth23,atletico,2021-05-16 03:27:06,AtleticoFan17,8

"i love suarez and am extremely grateful for him, but i just find it annoying/funny when he dives and really pretends to be in agonizing pain so he can sell the foul. and even when the ref has already called the foul, he sometimes stays on the ground pretending to be in actual pain, running down the clock and trying to make a scene at any opportunity he can get. I get that fouls win games in modern football and I personally have no problem with players going down from slight contact as a way to communicate to the referee that you dont actually want the advantage to be played, but its just a bad look when he drags it out reaaaally long and wastes so much time, especially when we're chasing the game. I get it tho, he really loves making a scene, its kinda funny actually. even when any opposition makes the slightest of a boastful move, he errupts and tries to look for the fight, its part of his personality and ive learned to find humor in it, especually when he gets tapped on the foot and decides to scream in excruciating pain for a few minutes, a lot of players do that. its loud and clear on tv too cause there are no fans in stadiums now.

"Very good first half. Sociedad's attack is good but are severely lacking in midfield. I remember a season/couple seasons ago when they had Odegaard and he was completely running us over in the midfield. That was one of the best overall(outfield) individual performances I have seen against us, besides Szoboszlai with Salzburg. 

We are playing very good. Suarez with that assist was absolutely brilliant. Llorente playing like a madman providing hockey assists, assists, getting into dangerous positions. If only he had scored that chance where he had beaten the goalkeeper. Lmao couldn't believe the BeIn commentator said he was selfish for taking a fucking shot in which he was one v one against the keeper.

"Anyone else absolutely disgusted by what Nike has done to our kits for the next two seasons? Next year's kit looks like our jersey was ripped apart, sewn back together, and run over by a dumpster truck. The season after has bizarre waving stripes with no inspiration or allure.

This current season and last season are the only two traditional and clean kits since 2016-17, otherwise the kits have all been absolutely terrible. Not sure why Nike is obsessed with fucking up the stripes on the kit, from the weird claw marks in 2017-18 to the bizarre optical illusion of 2018-19, now to the absolutely terrible kits for 2021-22 and 2022-23 it seems like they're intentionally trying to make our kits as ugly as possible.",gy8dhq5,n8oqpg,atletico,2021-05-16 01:01:24,Cafris,2

But I had a really good time watching the match today. I thought the tactics were right on and the players were locked in. I was reminded how much I care about this club, how grateful I am to everyone who busts their ass trying to win every game.

"We could have won this game if we had better finishing and took our chances well. Our corners were useless and some players did not have connection with each other in the 18.

Second half we again started to lose steam in the middle and started not to attack well with Joao coming in our attack was revived again and we were able to at least give them a threat. A draw against barca in Camp Nou is not a bad result especially since we lost to Athletic Club, Levante and Sevilla. Also lost points to teams like Getafe.

"It seems that [the lineup Simeone tried in the last training](https://www.marca.com/futbol/atletico/2021/05/06/6093c171ca4741be6f8b4577.html) included Kondogbia. 

The three in the back would be Savic, Gimenez (if fit) and Hermoso, with Trippier and Carrasco on both sides. The midfield would be Kondogbia, Koke and Lemar, and as forwards Cholo tried with Suarez and Llorente. 

I think it is a pretty interesting lineup. It would depend on Koke and Lemar to look forward and Kondogbia could be free to focus more on the defensive side. To me sounds strong for the first half, but probably when the match gets more heated up some changes might be necessary.",gx7v77g,n6l7q1,atletico,2021-05-07 08:32:46,FrkM,14

"This is almost mission impossible. We didn't win in the Camp Nou since 2006 and our form is not the best either especially in the past few away games. Hopefully Simeone goes in with the right tactics and formation without any innovations or mid game panic subs and formation changes like Llorente as a RB. I am sure we will be very defensive and will rely on counter attacks. In the defense take care of Messi, Messi and Messi. Especially outside the box or on our right from Savic, Trippier side. We have to stop him by any means even if we foul him. We also have to take care of our former player, De Jong and Dembele. Offensively we need very quick counters which are a key to easily break through the weak barca defense especially when they are pushing forward. Hopefully Carrasco and Llorente can speed up our attacks. Hopefully our players are fully recovered and in form so we can have a great game and get something out of it",gx81gni,n6l7q1,atletico,2021-05-07 09:26:30,mos1992,8

Correa-Suarez

or 

Predicted lineup 

Oblak

Savic-Gimenez-Hermoso

Tripps-Koke-Kondo-Lemar-Carrassco

Llorente-Suarez

personally for me, having Kondo at the base is probably going to be key in stopping barca. Koke at the base just not a good idea against quick teams. This works because Lemar, Koke can share the defense duties with Kondo while Llorente can float as SS, dropping into midfield and linking the attack. Having Llorente as Suarez strike partner will be very beneficial imo. And ofc our bench of Felix, Correa, Dembele will give us that firepower to get the job done.",gxb3w5m,n6l7q1,atletico,2021-05-08 03:22:53,Cholismo2pt0,3

Not everyone is an entitled piece of shit just because they disagree with you. Just like we can afford any top tier manager with his wages and as such continue to attract talent. Aguero, Forlan (could list more), and even Koke's promotion to the first team were pre Cholo, let us not forget.

"And honestly to all the Simeone out people - who in the world could take his place? Look at teams that go into a spiral of firing their managers, it is a long slippery road. Big names like Mourinho have failed over and over in different teams.

Simeone may be have questionable strategies, probably too conservative. But he has made us what we are, and his influence off the field is probably more important than we could ever imagine.

"I love and adore Cholo’s spirit. But like what has been said in this thread, I don’t know the entire history of Cholo and Atleti—I only know some parts of it. So I will share my POV, and no, I don’t want him gone. 

I guess what frustrates the fans who are not educated on Atleti’s history, myself included, is his adaptability with “modern football.” I grew up loving defensive football, and I prefer that when I play, but with the changes happening with the bigger clubs, you can’t help but wonder, why can’t we do that?

I realised in this season (and probably last season), he and the coaching staff have been more open to changes—with how we play, the players we scout and buy, etc., and I appreciate that. BUT we also have to call the poor decisions they’ve made like his decision vs. Elche, vs. Chelsea, Leipzig (to name a few). 

I feel like it’s an internal power struggle between what he knows best and willingness to risk it. It’s a gamble for him and the team, and I don’t think he’s 100% confident with our newfound formation yet. He’s okay to play it safe, which I think Simeone has mastered, but I do see the effort and the versatility he gives his players. 

TLDR; My point is Simeone deserves to stay because we have seen so many changes in the past year or so (including the growth of most of our players).",gwsiuxr,n3xa9x,atletico,2021-05-03 23:20:51,andreaaaa11,1

"Small picture: if Suarez was sharp the game was over in the first half. He brought on Joao for Lemar to push for a second goal, and he did absolutely nothing. If the ref didn’t give a bs free kick, and Marcos didn’t have an insane handball, they really didn’t have a chance to tie. 


Big picture: the chance of getting a better coach is almost 0. This year he was given a squad where only 12 players can perform, and 4 of them missed tons of time (Josema, Felix, Tripp, Suarez). He completely changed his strategy to the 3-5-2 to accommodate these 12 players. When these 12 started getting hurt/covid and we had to depend on the rest of the squad, we started dropping points. 

Biggest picture: Name a coach that lost more talent in one season than Godin, Felipe Luis, Juanfran, Lucas, Rodri, Griezmann. Then name me a coach that lost that talent and made the CL two years in a row with an entirely new squad. Then name me one who pushed for a league title year two.

Is that why simeone and the players choose to defend a 1-0 lead and resort to defending with their lives? I dont know. 

Instead of simeone resigning or get fired I would want him to focus on  and to explore more options. We have a fantastic attacking formation with very technical players. Look at felix against elche, he got à LOT of shit but in the end of the day how many good passes did he get? We cannot look at the front of the line (all of the time) when we have problems.

nothing is given in football. If we fire Cholo it's way more likely we take multiple steps back rather than another step forward. Jesus christ we were just invited to the super league. Thats not because we are Atletico fucking Madrid it's because of Cholo Simeone.

Good start to the game and the first half we played well. We should have been awarded a penalty but didn't happen. Second half we started in a good way but then started losing control of the game bit by bit. Joao should have taken his shot to end the game and this inefficiency is not acceptable when we are fighting for a title. As usual we dig ourselves in a hole and we were lucky to get out with this win especially since Elche were not very dangerous. Next week it is almost mission impossible against barca but hopefully we have no injuries until then,gwk0pp3,n2lduf,atletico,2021-05-02 00:21:44,mos1992,1
"My overall thoughts were that we played a great first half but Suarez’s lack of sharpness cost us. We easily could have been up 2-0 or 3-0 at half. Our second half subs didn’t help us and we lost the tactical advantage and really didn’t threaten. At not point during the game did elche look threatening until the penalty. The free kick on trippier shouldn’t not have been called and the penalty shouldn’t have happened. I think we were all so enraged because it seems like we keep bottling our chances. 

Kondogbia played great and I think if we are going to play 532 he needs to be at the base of the midfield. The problem is that leads to either Lemar, koke, or llorente being sacrificed. 

I don’t think any of us really feel good or confident about the rest of the season. However, I think our squad matches up with Real Madrid and FCB. Simeone is going to make or break this for us.",gwprzhf,n2lduf,atletico,2021-05-03 06:08:15,acousticburrito,1

"If this is how things stand, then Rafa Mir or Demebele make sense. Even if Saul goes away, i think we'll still be a bit conservative because of the financial crunch. We sadly couldn't see much out of Dembele. He has potential, and the best part is that he wants to give his all to Atleti. Really nice guy. Rafa Mir is an interesting prospect too. I think he's a ""voluminous"" striker - he'd go on for a goal, shoot from afar, try his luck : a very good trait. Thing is neither are ""world class"". Maybe Lautaro is closer to that (certainly more than the two), but something to understand is that any striker will essentially be a backup to Suarez, considering we've been playing Felix / Correa for SS, so two out &amp; out 9s is ruled out.

I personally don't want him at United but I am curious because he keeps getting linked to us every year. Currently he's also linked to Liverpool although some people believe it's his agent who desperate to find a club for him and in order to get that he's using United's name to get Liverpool to put a bid in.

I also wanted to ask about Kieran Trippier. Are Atletico fans confident that they'll be able to keep him because it certainly looks like his priority is to return to England.

"This is very difficult, it's not like we had just a few good players in more than a hundred years.

Futre. He was so good, I mean, you can see videos on youtube, and that doesn't make him justice. He was the best player in the world when he came to Atleti (was absolutely robbed in BdO), he had an aura of leadership that could make him win a match just because he wanted to. He was the best and he knew it, so he was constantly asking for the ball and offering himself. He had no problem going to the middlefield to create a chance. His only weak point was that he was completely left-footed and his right leg was just utterly useless. He was also good at diving xD

Caminero. He was amazing... but only when he wanted to be amazing. He had moments when everything he wanted to do just happened (look for his last goal to Barcelona), dribbling players like Maradona, giving passes like Xavi, keeping the ball like Iniesta. But he was a fucking diva, if we had to play vs Barcelona he would do an amazing match but if we had to play vs Celta he would play not even at his 50%, sometimes if he just was tired... well, he just forced a red card, yeah, like that. It seems he liked to party a lot, sometimes he was just wandering over the pitch.
There is also that rumor about Caminero hitting on Simeone's ex-wife...

Torres. Almost as bigger as the club, a kid who was the only thing that made us be proud to support Atleti, he was the only light we had in the darkest time of our history. And he had to leave... he had to leave us because the club was holding him back and he was unable to carry the club more than he did. He left us and became the star that we knew he was. He came back and did his best and because we are a shitty club he had to leave winning just the EL and not a CL as he deserved (also we deserved), but anyway, at least he won something with Atleti.

There are a lot of players who can be there, like Luis, Garate, Collar, Adelardo, Forlan, Godin, Aguilera, Filipe Luis, Gabi, Tiago...",h5mmy2p,omg2ih,atletico,2021-07-18 21:31:56,grip0matic,10

"We might have to pay 10-15 million to Barca because we only own 60 percent of Saul, so if Barca swap him, they'll only get 60 percent of his ownership, let's say Barca were to sell him for 50 million in the future, they'll only get 30 million, that is why they are asking for 15 million now as compensation. 

If Atleti sold Saul to Premier League, we only 24-30 million, Barca are using that as a leverage for the 15 million. If we can reduce the 15 million to 10 or 5 mil, would still be a great deal.

Griezmann wages are complicated, Is Griezmann asking for the difference in the paycut from Barca, like he made 40 million from Barca, and will supposedly make 24 mil at Atleti, so he wants 16 mil difference from Barca? Because if that's the case, it's completely ridiculous and unfair from Griezmann.

"1. Transfer rumors with swap-deal proposals are not reliable. They literally never happen.
2. Every club in europe nows this, you probably know this, you should know this! If you want an Atleti player you pay the release clause or GTFO! Especially, if the team is a direct rival.
3. [Atleti is in a financial position](https://www.intothecalderon.com/2021/6/26/22551512/atletico-madrid-shareholders-approve-significant-capital-increase-transfers-covid-laliga) to simply lowball Braca for griezmann. If Barca's concerns are lowering the wage bill, then why doesn't the board go for Antoine the same way we got Suarez? Not the same but the best thing Barca can do is liquidate assets. It doesn't make sense financially to go through a swap deal.
4. Saul is probably pushing for an exit but the board and cholo will not let him leave easily. On top of that, Sual is not the type of player to make a dramatic exit. He will most likely leave once the board finds a high bidder and somewhere Saul  wants to play.

I can see the board pulling the trigger and buying back Griezmann and letting go of Saul in the same transfer window. However, it most likely won't happen the way the media is making it seem.

"I’ll always be upset about how Griezmann left us, but this feels like the right move for Atleti. He wants to be here, Cholo wants him here and he’s going to work his ass off to try to win the fans over. Saúl doesn’t want to be here, he doesn’t want to fight for his spot in the starting XI and I haven’t heard of any other team offering anything as appealing as a player like Griezmann in exchange for Saúl.

It sounds like your idea of Atleti’s identity may be different than mine, but Griezmann is beloved by our manager, our captain and probably other players on the team. I think he’s going to help us win games and I don’t think we should feel that our identity is lost simply because he made a decision that hurt us a few years ago.",h57khnm,okeifu,atletico,2021-07-15 06:56:32,obi_obi_obi,10

"Atleti, Hasta la Muerte. No deal should affect the passion you have for the club, if Saul wants to leave then be grateful, if Griezmann wants to come back then let him. The club is bigger than single legend or personality.

Anything or anyone that can help get to that point should be welcomed.",h57k920,okeifu,atletico,2021-07-15 06:54:33,porrfe01,38
"Here's my take. If Cholo, Koke, and the team are ok with it then so am I. Griezmann has always given his all on the pitch and I believe he would greatly increase our odds of winning el doblete and potentially even the long awaited CL. 

The flip side is that you have to respect the emotions and opinions of our fan base. Griezmann left in a manner that many felt was disrespectful to the club. I believe this can be forgiven with a sincere apology and a lot of effort on the pitch, but it's not something that is going to be forgiven and looked over easily.",h57jauq,okeifu,atletico,2021-07-15 06:46:40,SAULucion,18

"I appreciate the passion, but the rum-dummy-dum stridency of this fanbase drives me up a wall. The sainted status of certain figures, the constant professing of vaguely defined ""values"" that a huge corporate entity can't possibly hold or promote, the rigid definitions of who is and isn't ""a true fan."" (This is without even getting into the fact that some of the most committed Atleti supporters are violent right-wingers who stabbed a guy and chucked him in the river a few years back.)

The club lost its way, if indeed that's what happened, decades ago. I'm not saying there cannot be a rich and rewarding community around it—sport is beautiful; it's a great opportunity to share an experience and relate to each other—but the idea that Atleti need to do one thing or another to comply with some abstract moral standard is only slightly less ridiculous than saying you're ""very disappointed in Exxon"" or whatever.",h57kyxc,okeifu,atletico,2021-07-15 07:00:32,csmcgowan,20

"I want Saul to stay, and I throw up a little bit in my mouth when I think of Griezmann back, but.. I mean.. if you look at it coldly, we would have an outstanding team, contenders to all titles. No wonder Simeone is pushing for it.

Saul is already our 12th man, and he'll have even less minutes with de Paul in the team, so we are basically sending a useful midfielder and we are getting a world class striker in return. If you look at it that way, it's a no brainer. Antoine would have to show some humility, and grow up a bit from his childish ways, but after a few boos in the first weeks it'll all be back to where it was a couple of seasons ago.

Also what a way to humiliate Barca: We send Griezmann and Saul, and we get back Felix, Suarez and Griezmann (at a lower salary that he had!).

Every club does this where they ask players first before going through all this hassle only to be declined by the player..

I mean Sancho had his personal terms agreed with United a whole season before the eventual move..

Griezmann still gave his all after agreeing to move to Barca which shows he's a professional and still had love for the club..

He also didn't take a raise when moving to barca, meaning he went there because it was his dream to play for them and not a move due to financial reasons as seen with alot of players they've gathered in the previous few years..

"No,never.I really don't understand people that wouldn't mind seeing him back here at Atletico.He played us,the fans,he played the club,signed a contract behind club's back,created unecessary drama,acted like some manchild,disrespected everything about Atletico,and lastly left to a rival.This last thing doesn't hurt me as much as the rest,if he left to Barca without doing all the above,I wouldn't dislike him,I would still be thankful for what he did for us and probably would be glad for him to come back to Atleti.

I like to believe that this club has values,that it's people's club (if u understand me,i dont know how to describe it different) and that its not all about these superstars and titles - its about loving the colors,respecting the badge and suffering together.Not accepting a player that did that to us just because of 15-20 goals he will score.

To add to this,I love Griezmann's playstyle and everything about how he plays,when I sometimes watch Barca or France game and see him going all the way to defence,stealing away the ball from oponnent,it just makes me smile,but I still dont like even a thought of seeing him back at Atleti.

Also Saul is involved in this possible swap,and it will be really hard to see Atleti without Saul - thats also one of the reasons im against that swap

"As I said in the match thread:

All things considered, the result is bearable. Of course statistically we should have won, but a draw is fine, given the circumstances.

Furthermore: 

The dropped points aren't the end of the word. We have to put this behind us and have the right mentality to make the most of the next match. Partido a partido. Ignore the other teams and just face whatever is ahead of us.

That said, I think we need to work on finishing in general. Correa has improved, and Suarez is clinical, but can't play every match. Perhaps Cunha will prove very important, and Joao may be a big boost too. In general I think our players need to train on being more clinical, in the same way Angel seems to have.",hauude5,pe4wn9,atletico,2021-08-30 06:09:16,Coenzyme-A,26

"Suarez basically glues himself to a position in the box and literally just asks for the ball to his feet.. All we need to do is just pass to him and he will put it in the net.. 

Thats exactly how he scored the goal, and if you'll recall, everytime carrasco or lemar are making runs, he just stands and asks for the ball to his feet after calculating the shot..

I'm writing this down in case someone has lemar or Carrasco's numbers..

Also: We should probably stick with guy for corners, switching them after every corner doesn't make any sense.. With 15 corners, lemar or carrasco could probably calibrate the ball perfectly for one good cross to end up in goal..  Currently there isn't any rhythm and our corners are taken very lightly by opposition..",hauvadb,pe4wn9,atletico,2021-08-30 06:16:17,LilHalwaPoori,15

our defence was lacking, i'd say savic was having an especially awful game with oblak also not being top notch during the first goal. in the first half we had too many chances to NOT score a goal, and really the ones we scored were kinda lucky (especially the second one lol).

Good match from Lemar, it was not enough with the offensive power we have. Nicely enough, when we get back from the international break, Felix will be back. I'm very excited for that. Cunha looked good with the little time he had.

Emery took a risk by setting up his tactics to defend for their lives in the first half and not concede. They left us to attack to exhaust us as we were going after the goal. In the second half against an exhausted side is when he started his quick counters. In the first goal we conceded it is a repeat of a lot of goals we conceded from the same spot the last few seasons. We should close down and not let anyone shoot from outside the box. In the second goal we conceded I did not understand the confusion between Savic and Gimenez. Both looked really shaky today when tested. It is a disappointing draw with all of the chances we created but I'll take it. In the break we need to improve the fitness and stamina. In the last three games we lost our breath after the 60th minute. Offensively we are creating chances but we need to improve the finishing and decision making in the last third.,hav1iid,pe4wn9,atletico,2021-08-30 07:04:09,mos1992,3

"Well, that didn't make any goddamn sense. Dropping the points is whatever; shit happens. (If this match proved anything, it's that shit happens.) I just really hope—in vain, probably—that Cholo doesn't use a largely impressive performance featuring a couple big mistakes and weird bounces as an excuse to pummel us with six weeks of timid anti-football that makes me want to pluck my eyes out of my skull.

"Carrasco is lackluster up front. This experiment has been performed many times and we know how it ends every single time. Llorente is yet again being wasted at RWB even though he is playing much better today than he did last game. He has made dangerous runs forward and put in a couple of good crosses, but he can be doing much better. He needs to play RCM. 

I also want to see Koke more involved in this match. He should be picking up passes and throwing them to the right to RDP and to the left to Lemar but he seems to be occupying similar spaces to RDP at times. Yeah, it's gonna take some time to get used to but RDP can do consistently what Koke used to do back in 13/14 and 14/15 with those through balls. Koke is a tireless anchor and that's where he thrived the most last season and found his best form in years.

With all this said,we should give him a chance,he is young and has potential,maybe he will end up even better than Vlahovic and one main thing that matters to me - Cunha wanted to come play for Atleti,Vlahovic only wanted a big conract at Fiorentina.",h9wb5yx,p99slt,atletico,2021-08-22 19:08:22,hrz12,13

"I like the player but I don't think this coaching staff can succeed in developing a second striker type into a nine. (It's why I didn't want Lautaro either.) Part of the reason Suarez has worked so well—after a series of bad to just okay strikers post-Costa—is that he arrived fully formed. I don't think they coach him all that much; he just kinda knows what to do. Plus he's obviously quite a good finisher.

Cunha's going to have to remake his game and I don't think Cholo or his assistants have the vision to help him with it. Plus he's reportedly pretty arrogant. Maybe they can get him to work harder on the pitch, but can they teach him to move intelligently and contribute Suarez-y stuff from an unfamiliar position? I'm not confident that's going to happen.

Correa today was a 10/10 - He was great at linking up with others, on the ball, movement off the ball, and excellent finishing.  Absolutely brilliant performance from him.

The backline was very sloppy and clumsy today, we are lucky Celta didn’t score in open play. Hopefully it’s just a case of it being the first game and we are rusty.",h922g0l,p4xxct,atletico,2021-08-16 02:00:27,SunOfInti_92,6

With 4 of our best 11 not playing today and it being 10000 degrees can’t ask for much more from the first half. A bit sloppy with some passing but it’s an oven out there.,h91nz4b,p4vndj,atletico,2021-08-16 00:20:04,Dophie,5

Kondogbia is so fucking good. Seems many are having physical problems so hope there aint anything serious.,h91nxot,p4vndj,atletico,2021-08-16 00:19:48,1ngK,12

"If you watch the full game Feyenoord was just as bad as Atleti. 

The fans were even worse come on now. Neither was in the right but Carrasco could have been badly injured from the player perspective. Guy misses tackle and tries to squeeze your ankle against the grass. Same thing happened to fofana and look at him more likely to miss half or even the entire season.

Embarrassing yes, but when someone is playing that dangerous during a friendly what’s going to hurt more? Carrasco pushing and arguing with players. Or Carrasco on the ground because some idiot wanted to injure him when the ball and the play wasn’t on the field.",h874c85,p0jqz2,atletico,2021-08-09 02:43:09,TheCruzOf00,40
"I may be on the minority here but I disagree. Is it stupid to act that way, yeah. At the same time that’s passion by way of competition. Adding to that Carrasco felt like his ankle was squeezed between the defenders legs. wether it was an accident or not  it caused him to freak out because thats extremely dangerous, look at Fofana. 

Then Simeone… the face of the club. Did he act dumb, yes but when has Cholo ever been cool, calm, and collected during a match. The man is a volcano waiting to erupt in every game good or bad. Throw in the tensions, scrappy playing by both sides, roudy fans, &amp; the ending. I’m not exactly shocked his emotions got the best of him. Coaches &amp; players do this stuff every year in every type of sport, it’s gonna happen. All you can do is forget what happen, be the professionals your expected to be &amp; focus on the next game.",h878k5m,p0jqz2,atletico,2021-08-09 03:15:54,boarder415,14
"Tbh I don't care, it was a heated game  and Feyernoord are proper cunts. I don't think it's that big of a deal. Ggwp to them though for winning against us  
Just one wish, stop portraying Carrasco as a boogieman in general as if he had an issue with aggression, yes he's very ""passionate"" but he doesn't get many cards, not a single straight red, only one second yellow in 330 competitive matches. I don't see an issue there.",h87f088,p0jqz2,atletico,2021-08-09 04:06:20,johnnoe_5589,12
