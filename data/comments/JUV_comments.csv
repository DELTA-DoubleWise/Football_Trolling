"Calm down everyone this is still the same team, coach and management that we were really excited about last week.

Pirlo made a mistake by trying to force Morata in and putting Cuadrado as a LB, same with Kulusevski as RB. Which made them play bad and have no confidence. Which put extra pressure on the 3 CBs and also forced the 2 central midfielders (mckennie and rabiot and later arthur and benta) to do twice the amount of work they normaly would need to do. So thats 7 players distracted and doing unnecessary work and losing confidence. Also Morata wasn’t exactly great today",g6vwzk0,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:46:05,Juventusy,42
I need De Ligt in my life,g6vwo8e,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:43:30,d_p0p,110
"Not ideal, but considering the circumstances Juve fought really well and showed some character to pull out a draw. A point away to Roma isn’t a catastrophe by any stretch. 

Morata clearly needs more time to get up to speed, the lack of partnership with Ronaldo was telling. He did good in the buildup when he was involved, but needs more time to figure out the rhythm of the team. 

I don’t think Cuadrado played poorly on the left, but I also think his lack of a left foot hurt our ability to build possession. That’s definitely Frabotta’s spot to lose, which was never ever a sentence that I thought I would be typing. 

McKennie had himself a sophomore slump, his weak passes from week 1 carried over and it came back to bite him. He’ll get there, but he’s not a finished product yet. Rabiot just was completely off his game today. I think Arthur and Bentancur have an opportunity vs. Napoli to make a statement and take a starting spot. 

Sir Chesney’s still good for a couple of passes out of bounds per game, which is concerning. He’s one of the very best shot stoppers in the game though, that’s undeniable. 

Ronaldo is the soul of this team right now, and that is a very, very good thing. 

I don’t think Pirlo was wrong necessarily with what he was trying to do, but some of his decisions with the XI didn’t work out. I think we’ll see Ronaldo and Dybala up top vs. Napoli, Frabotta and Cuadrado on the wings, and either Ramsey or Kulu in the hole behind the forwards. Danilo scares me defensively a few times a game but his value in possession is huge. I wonder if he’s going to nail that RCB/RB role down all for himself. Some of the team’s weaknesses carried over from last week and this time they were costly. We’ll see how Pirlo addresses them in training. I’m upset, but overall not worried yet.",g6vy8d6,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:56:06,Bradleys_Bald_Spot,34

"Pirlo tweaked the formation and it didn't work. Made adjustments at half that I think helped. 

I like Cuadrado on the right, but he was very poor on the left. We need Sandro back. 

Morata struggled a bit. Saw some positives as well though. He will just need more time to integrate, but I think starting him was a mistake by Pirlo. 

McKennie was worse today. Misplaced some fairly easy passes, but was still energetic. Rabiot had a good game overall but made some seriously dumb mistakes. He can't be a starter if he is going to do that, which is frustrating because he is so good. 

Kulu was clever, but too isolated. Danilo actually had a class game today and seems good in that RCB role. 

Arthur and Bentancur looked good coming on. Those 2 should be starting. Think Arthur needs fitness though sadly. 

Tough game. Decent adjustments. Frustrating result, but overall its nothing too terrible. We will come back stronger against Napoli.",g6vx48o,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:47:09,Killagina,51
"Jesus Christ.

Cuadrado was playing the ""wrong position"". Reallly shouldn't be surprised he was ass. And for all the people complaining about him playing.. where in god's name would Juve get their width without Cuadrado? LOL

Cuadrado has to fucking play. Not because he's some spectacular player, but because Juve's roster is terribly flawed.

Pirlo was completely out managed today. Not taking in Rabiot was awful at that point of the game. Ronaldo and Morata were not playing close enough to even link up. Disastrous. Still extremely hopeful for the future of this team. 

I still don't understand people saying Kulusevski is incredibly pacey.  Haven't seen any flashes of him running behind defenders. 

Arthur was very solid today. extremely poised and decisive with the ball.

Bentancur was good as well. 

Chillieni was fine. But Bonucci and Danillo defensively have been shocking. De Ligt would do wonders. 

Ronaldo created the penalty, Ronaldo scored an incredibly header despite the cross going a bit behind. Also tracked back when needed. This is why Ronaldo is probably the best player in the world right now.

"Maybe unpopular opinion, but I thought Danilo was our second best player this game after CR7. I only saw him beaten maybe once by Spinazzola, his passings were almost all on point and Ronaldo assist.

"- Frabotta needs to start on the left when Sandro isn't playing. Putting a RW on a LB / LWB is... 

- Artur looked good. Big dick energy from the little man.

- Ronaldo was good today.

- Chiellini and Bonucci are too slow for a high line, which is why Allegri played deep. More often than not.

- Poor from Pirlo and his staff. They needed to put out a better 11 and not taking off Rabiot was schoolboy mistake.",g6vx6fo,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:47:38,i_Avernus,28
"I think we could have won if Rabiot hadn't been sent off. It was an amateurish decision from Pirlo to not sub him off knowing that he was at risk of getting a yellow, but this is only his second game ever in Serie A, so he was bound to make some mistakes. Frabotta reminds me a lot of Spinazzola the one season he was here. He's really impressed me so far. 

Roma were playing at home and were a man up for half an hour and yet were constantly falling on the ground. Their antics were embarrassing.",g6vxb30,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:48:42,Juventina1234,16
"Some thoughts:

1. If you want McKennie to be like Kante you need a midfield 3 (not Ramsey refusing to get back and defend). Arthur being introduced was good but no one provided him with an outlet and he was left dribbling in his own penalty area.
2. Bonucci and Chiellini was the best CB partnership for a decade but they can't play high up the pitch and defend against pace anymore.
3. Inverted fullbacks -- I recall seeing Pep use this at Bayern in the UCL and it didn't work. He did it with Lahm and Alaba. Middle of the pitch gets too congested and opposition midfield doesn't get stretched.",g6w5s5i,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 06:01:27,Ecstatic-Coach,8
"I never want to see Cuadrado play on the left again, just horrible all game long. I would love to not see him start again film stop, but somehow he’s our best RB since Cancelo. 

Questions have to be asked about Chielini Bonucci, does the pairing not work anymore or is due to the formation? Shocking defending either way and we’re lucky Roma didn’t score more. 

In the end we got lucky with the point, Ronaldo saved us and Roma had some incredible misses. Onwards and upwards against Napoli, otherwise Mertens and Insigne will have a field day",g6vx5eu,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:47:24,Babostainer,13
"Morata was rough. Flashback to why he was never any good past his early seasons at Juve. Chelsea, RM, and ATM never contested letting him go for a reason. Hopefully we don’t need to rely on him, and he is just used as a rotational player.

We looked much better then moment he was taken off, even though we played with 10 players.

Cuadrado as LB... doesn’t work lol. Clearly he needs to play on the right side. Fabrotta looks like he should be able to hold LB/LWB well based on the first two games. Nice to see youth being backed.

Bright lights are: Rabiot is still great, just an unfortunate sending off. Arthur looks good.",g6vwuxj,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:45:03,visitorx_,27

I might be wrong and maybe it was smart to get a foul there at 92nd minute but I thought caudrado should have passed to frabotta(on the lw).

I'm willing to chalk this one up to growing pains under Pirlo. Shape set us up to be exposed at the back on counters and constantly outnumbered in central midfield which was asking too much of Rabiot and McKennie at this point in their careers.

"1. Alvero was put on too early. Should go on vs Crotone or something like that. Get him used to the team. He was also man marked to death.

2. Arthur was amazing

3. Roma’s second was sloppy. Should of still had defenders back. Kulu should not take those kicks.

4. I hate to say it, but Western and Rambo where a bit overhyped. I didn’t see anything from western, and Dybala would make more sense im the number 10 role.

5.  BREAKING NEWS!!! Over running the tackle and hopelessly sending your foot back doesn’t work! Incredible!

"Not too bad overall. Things didn't work out as well as against Samp, but away against Rome on the second day is always going to be hard. We clawed one back with a man down and fought to the end.  Good enough in the end.",g6vxqxm,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:52:10,spiz,3
"Back down to earth. I think there was overreaction to the Sampdoria game and there will be overreaction to this as well. Pirlo’s a brand new coach and there will be growing pains and lessons learned. I still think the team has absorbed Pirlo’s ideas faster and more effectively than Sarri’s. The Cuadrado as LWB experiment didn’t work. Morata looked like he needs more time I was surprised to him start. We looked vulnerable on Defense the entire game. 

For me the biggest thing to look out for is:

Is the vulnerability on defense a feature or a bug? People have been saying for YEARS that Pep’s City are too easy to counter and play through when they don’t have the ball. Liverpool leave space behind their attacking fullbacks. We know that this is a feature of their system, because it’s almost impossible to set your team up perfectly to attack and defend equally well. If Pirlo is going to attack and press intensely, I think we can expect the vulnerability on D to continue even if we’ll look better with De Ligt and Sandro back. For sure we need more balance than we had today, we can’t be this disorganized at the back but even last week when we looked amazing you could see that there was space to exploit. 

Overall, I’m glad it didn’t take Pirlo long to learn that at the highest levels you can’t just tinker and experiment to your hearts desire without being punished if you make the wrong choice. That said, there were still moments were you could see this is Pirlo not Sarri. The pressing was there more often than last season, the subs were on point and changed the game, and the team showed great character to get back in it after going down a man. Strap in boys and girls, this season is gonna be a roller coaster but I believe in Pirlo.",g6vxwga,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:53:22,jct1121,3

"I'll say it once more, Morata as a starter is complete deadweight to our team. He doesn't press, has poor positioning, has poor tactical awareness, isn't a great passer.

"My analysis is that we are still trying to force the game through midfield. Ramsey's job is to shuffle the ball from midfield to wingbacks underlapping. But this game they had 4 midfielders playing against our 2. Our only way of attacking was through right side where we had both danilo and kulu playing as wingbacks supported by Rabiot offensively. Other way was Ronaldo running with the ball. Morata was useless for both. Ramsey was neutralized so useless. Mckennie tried his best but his passing accuracy and quickness is not great. Rabiot I think did great offensively as well as Kulu. I genuinely believe problem was playing with 2 strikers. I mean we have 2 strikers and 35 year old runs more than the other. So we just got overrun and our midfield lacked support. In the second half things started to become better defensively but Rabiot got red carded and thanks god we scraped one point. As conclusion, Morata should be played as sole striker so we don't have to depend on him. Or he should be able to play his behind towards the goal like Dzeko and at least get some fouls by holding up the ball. It is kinda harsh to put the blame on Morata, but we basically played with 10 man.
Btw although Danilo was good offensively, I don't see the point of him playing as cb. In offense we transform to a 4 3 3 and he becomes a rb but in 3 4 1 2 our defence is not good which is the opposite of what's expected. So why not just play with 4 3 3 ?",g6vxwht,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:53:22,burnoutmonk,3

"Some observations on the midfield:

1. It seemed to me that Rabiot and McKennie kinda have too similar positions. It could have worked if both found their footing.
2. However, McKennie was most likely nervous. Playing against Roma is different to playing against Sampdoria so he probably felt the pressure even more this game. It did seem that last game he integrated seamlessly. This game probably gave us a better temperature check at where he is.
3. Rabiot was great but it seemed that he was a bit too feisty. No matter how people felt about the incident that led to the red card, he was bound to be kicked out if he didn't manage himself.
4. Arthur was great. He held the ball well, his passes looked better.
5. Bentancur played decently, he would have been a better player instead of McKennie.",g6vxyvb,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 04:53:54,markus_ultra,1

"I'll take it. Pirlo is still new, he'll learn from this. We're also hurt by not having two of our best players in MdL and Dybala available, especially the former given how slow the Chiellini-Bonucci pairing is.

This was pretty much a line up mistake from Pirlo. Starting Cuadradon the left. Kulusevski is always isolated every time he got the ball on the right wing with only 1 or 2 times Ramsey was there. Morata did what he could with what he had. McKennie not playing well either. Bonucci got dribbled too easily as well.,g6vzire,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 05:07:06,Ahazveroz,1
"I'll paste my comment from another thread:

&gt;We got the game wrong. McKennie and Ramsey are fantastic when the opponents want possession, they press and recover many balls on their own. But when the others are letting you play and they play on counters, those two are quite bad at setting up the play.
Rabiot was the only one able to do so, but he's been too ""soft"" and lacked grit. After he left we subbed in Arthur and Douglas Costa, two press resistant player who like possession and are not afraid of facing the opponents (unlike Rabiot, who in that situation just turns around and passes it to the defense), so we started playing better.  
If we had started with Bentancur and Arthur in the midfield from the beginning we'd have won the game IMO.",g6vzq2o,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 05:08:49,Starbuck1992,1
"In defence of pirlo! MDS is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo shit!!!

Just not that guy which makes me like pirlo bcas mds is garbage",g6vzskj,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 05:09:25,Juventusy,1
"We're really lucky to take home 1 point here. I really appreciate Pirlo's willingness to try new things, but this was a failed experiment from the start. On the bright side, we didn't completely fail.

Leveraging a debut sometimes works wonders but not when shoehorning several other players into an off position. Most of the teams productivity came in the second half and surprisingly after we lost Rabiot to a red card. I think this has to do more with Roma slowing down than our subs, but it's still something to note. 

Some problems are definitely susceptibility to counter attack - that was made clear in this game until Roma broke down more in the second half - and also passing accuracy in general. We made *so many* (more than is normal) mistakes working from out of the back. They were mostly easy passes, too. If we tighten up how we play at the back, everything else will fall into place because for once we are looking dangerous moving forward. 

It's clear we're posturing for an attacking style of play, but it really feels like the wingbacks cannot rely on the CB's which creates an unbalanced dynamic. If our wingers can play more freely (like against Sampdoria) the team flourishes. I think the team needs to identify clearly and quickly when an opposing team is playing the counter and adjust for it so we don't get bit like we did today. 

Other notes:

-Arthur should play more
-Frabotta should play more
-Cuadrado at LWB and Kulu at RWB needs to never happen again
-We really need at least 1 pacey CB
-We need to cross more (still)
-We need to take more risky passes in the final third because we're finally making more off the ball runs (especially in behind the line)

Napoli next week is going to be another tough tough game, but we learned a lot today and I believe Pirlo will use that to great effect. Forza Juve",g6w0cpx,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 05:14:06,jbogs7,1

"Thought that there was a lot to work on, but I was quite happy overall.

\- Arthur looks like he could be a real steal. Didn't watch DK at Parma; people are saying he can play LW, RW, ST, CM, CAM - could you experiment and play Bentancur as a DM with Arthur and DK in a midfield 3?

\- Passing is still crisp and smooth.

\- Link up play and general expression has been the best in years. Saw at least 2 back-flicks, and Kulusevski's skill on the wing in the first half was sublime to watch.

\- Managed the game well with 10 men and scored.

\- More open, expansive play.

Sure, lots to improve too, as many have noted, but, having been very pessimistic and cynical over the last few years, I'm happy to have seen *something* different. I like this base from a new team that has yet to gel with a manager who's managed a handful of games. I'm taking something from that.",g6w1jxu,j0yhm9,Juve,2020-09-28 05:24:36,[deleted],1

"My summary of this game is that the team was horribly imbalanced. Both wing backs didn’t know how to play wide and were facing inwards by default due to which foot was stronger. The midfield that was good last week looked shaky this week, perhaps as Roma made the most of counter attacking.

"It's OK. New unexperienced coach, new game model, new midfield, I would be surprised if we crushed everyone from the start. I'm still don't understand some Pirlo's decisions. Why he decide to try Morata, who is 3 days in the team, in start 11? And even more, Morata was in start by cost of one of wingbacks. Even more surprising was position of Cuadrado, who spent all his career on right flank, on LWB position. Mckennie wasn't good today, too many mistakes in tackles and passes. Because of that to much job for Rabiot. Yellow card for french for handball and it's become only a matter of time when red will be. Thank god we have CR7. This man just an example of will to win. I'm not sure, not very often watched CR7 in MU and RM, but I think that it wasn't normal for this clubs, that Cristiano in last 10 mins participate in defensive  actions near own box. He is unbelievable athlete and professional.

For me is most important that I can see direction chosen by Pirlo and playstyle he want to create. It's won't be easy, but I'm ready to give him time.",g6w2z01,j0waqa,Juve,2020-09-28 05:36:56,Abarakadavr,8

"Everytime I give my analysis I get flooded with downvotes here more than anywhere, anyways here are my 2 cents. It isnt the end of world, city got 5 bayern 4,but this juve even improved its not simply a team. Its just a dyslexic, assymetric 50 shades of ronaldo. Even if ronaldo was 28 we couldnt just rely on him. Rotatting players and formations hoping he can score one more. I ALWAYS SAID IT :i d rather have less quality but compatible players than a dybala very specific, a cr7 very specific, etc etc. Morata is not juve quality. Ramsey tho very improved has no place here. Without fast playing wingers and playmakers that know each other every team is doomed to be dead. So dont except a champions semifinal without players like adama traore, maddison, dembele etc. We still rely on cuadrado and costa which are over 30 and injury prone.

"I cannot believe there is so much hype surrounding Morata's arrival, when you consider just how underwhelming of a player he is. It's as if peoples perception has been clouded by nostalgia when he was a young promising player, instead of fast-forwarding 5 years and acknowledging he's soon to be 28 and has consistently disappointed as he's bounced from club to club. 

We're literally paying wages and €10m (at a minimum) to loan one of the most incompetent forwards in the current game, potentially more if he remains. Someone who has had excuse, after excuse, after excuse used to justify his continued failings. Who often has more interest in sulking, going to ground, arguing with officials, routinely being offside, or looking completely disinterested and often lazy. 

His current career record breaks down as follows; 

**Real Madrid** \- 63 appearances / 25 goals / 6 assists   
Best return 16/17 - 15 goals and 5 assists from 23 appearances. 

**Juventus** \- 63 appearances / 15 goals / 12 assists  
Best return 14/15 - 8 goals and 5 assists from 29 appearances.

**Chelsea** \- 47 appearances / 16 goals / 6 assists  
Best return 17/18 - 11 goals and 6 assists from 31 appearances.

**Atletico Madrid** \- 49 appearances / 18 goals / 3 assists  
Best return 19/20 - 12 goals and 2 assists from 34 appearances. 

**Champions League record** \- 52 appearances / 15 goals / 8 assists  
Best return 14/15 (Juventus) - 5 goals and 2 assists from 12 appearances. 

That's such a heinous return when you consider the teams he's played in, the quality of team mates surrounding him and alike. 

I'm honestly baffled that people think this is a good bit of business, particularly after all the pissing and moaning had last season about all the deadweight we have. Now these same people are clamouring over someone just as inferior - it's bewildering to say the least. I'm sure, we'll likely see the famed Morata purple patch that's fairly customary, which may last for anywhere between a couple of weeks to a month or so, before fizzing out and normal mediocracy returning. That's just not going to cut it though, not when play like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPLrgXNFuJA&amp;t=25s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-1WGE1P1lU) or even [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0um0kLo4N0) will only take a matter of time to surface. 

We finally take a few steps forward with some good signings, offloading some deadweight, then immediately go and take two steps backwards with this sort of signing. I suppose the silver-lining is that it's a loan, not a permanent deal. So at least we'll be able to bin him with relative ease.",g6adkjn,ixwdvf,Juve,2020-09-23 12:14:58,endlessxcircle,-3

We still had some of the brain farts we had last year and allowed Samp to get into dangerous positions but not bad for the first game of the season.

Whatever Pirlo has changed in the dressing room, I see a huge improvement over Sarri and late Allegri’s tenure

Players are finally playing properly with energy, enthusiasm and determination. 

Granted Sampdoria isn’t much of a hard opponent, I am extremely pleased with the quality of football and actually look forward to watching more.

McKennie is actually a great player. If he continues playing like today, I’d rather have him start over Bentancur.

Rabiot and Ramsey feel completely rejeuvanated, legitimately want them to stay now.

Perhaps unpopular but I feel like Dybala might  become a weak link in Pirlos type of football. Everyone was pressing tonight, the physical work was impressive. And this is Dybala biggest weakness.

"Poor match from Ronaldo.

Still apparently had an ""assist"" and a goal lmao.

interestingly enough, Ronaldo was much better in the build up than in the final third.

First time really watching Kulusevski. His touch and crosses are decent, but has disappointing pace this game. Couldn't get separation from defenders.

"was a bit skeptical when i saw the line up but the boys came out and played well.

"Entire team played well. Thought Cuadrado could have done better playing some forward balls to Kulu. Frambotta had a fairly average / below average 1st half, but looked good in the second. 

Tactically I was happy. Very flexible formation it seemed. 

McKennie, Chiellini, Kulu, and Ramsey were the best on the pitch. I'd say Ronaldo was the worst. No one played poorly though.",g60z325,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:45:38,Killagina,9

"After Sarri's work, this game is pure orgasm. Fresh, dynamic, confidend team. Great individual perfomances of young players, insatiable Ronaldo, impenetrable pair Chellini-Bonucci, and many, many long diagonal passes. Goddammit how I missed good long balls! Don't know what magician Pirlo is, but Ramsey played twice better than his best games last season. If he'll keep this level our midfield gonna be world class. McKennie is potentially new prime Vidal. Burned middle of field. Rabiot was fantastic too. Frabotta is absolute surprise and absolute dominator on our left flank. If he can play like this regular than Sandro can start worry about his place in start 11. Kulusevski scored beautiful goal, but I have feeling that he can be even better.

And we still need CF, plus waiting the return of Dybala and De Ligt. Juve can be much better. Wow, with Sarri I already forgot that it is possible to wait next game with good foretaste.",g615urp,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 05:25:49,Abarakadavr,9
"As much as I like Ronaldo, I really dislike when he has a bad game and misses a few chances, and he goes into this super-try-hard mode and tries to make everything happen for himself, usually ruining all the attacking team play and build up for the team.

I couldn't even count the number of times he just held the ball and tried to dribble in stupid situations instead of passing a teammate (usually Kulusevski, did he pass him even once?) who was in a much better position.

It's a good thing he scored eventually, perhaps he just really needed to get that out of his system.

On another note I think this was a great start for Pirlo, Kulusevski and McKennie, and a great performance by Ramsey. Looking forward to the next game.",g60y7xl,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:40:36,Krankelibrankelfnatt,46

"It's one game and don't want to make any judgements based off of it. But I will say, there is a bright future for this squad. Unbelievable talent on display today. They need to tighten things up a bit, but WOW. The potential is there.

Also has to be said how immense Chiellini is. Genuinely think if he's out there last season Sarri might still be here. But on the other hand, the fact that Ramsey went from barely playing and absolutely terrible under Sarri into one of the best midfield performances I've seen in 3 years for a Juve player is quite telling. 

People were too quick to give up on Ramsey. It was more likely that Sarri wasn't working than for a bunch of players who used to be good all of a sudden weren't good anymore",g610oeq,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:55:00,[deleted],4

Kulusevski and McKennie were really good. Frabotta made some good runs too, considering he is part of our under 23 squad.

The man of the match IMO was Ramsey, he was everywhere, pressing, creating chances and linking up going forward. His best performance in our shirt so far. Here is hoping he can stay fit!",g613fyo,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 05:12:03,Ro9,4

"I know the match was ""only"" against Sampdoria and it was only one game, but it's insane how much better the team looked in comparison to the last season - finally they're showing grinta and fighting to the last minute.

Even on the individual level the change is huge. For instance Ramsey (on who I've shat my fair share last season) is looking like a player that justifies such a salary.

There were some defensive hickups in the last quarter of the match, but all in all a very promising start of the season.",g60yuzu,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:44:21,grdivrag,3

"This is by far the most fun I've had watching a Juve match in a long time.

-Great debut goal for Kulusevski

-The young American put on a great performance proving he's not just here for marketing 

-A great show for Frabotta on his first senior game

-A return to form for Ramsey and a MOTM performance

-Chiellini returns and runs all over the place especially when covering for Frabotta

-Ronaldo, even though he didn't have the best performance, reminded us why he's the GOAT with a classic goal. And, for the first time, his runs behind the defense are not ignored!

Let's hope we continue on this form. Forza Juve!",g60zedk,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:47:27,geobuddy,5
"I am really hyped for rest of the season! 

Ramsey played really great with those passes and I really hope he stays fit.

Kulu is very strong on the ball and scored a nice goal on his debut.

McKennie was so close to scoring many times and had nice tackles to win the ball back, he's probably the player I'm most hyped about.

"The team had a good start. Ronnie was shit today with all the ball holdings. He could have passed more. I felt that he was frustrated and good thing it got out of his system at the end. Ramsey was just amazing. Rabiot was very good except for the end where he looked very tired and lost possession.
 If Arthur too sets in,  our midfield will go from worst to good for now. Kulu was very good but could be more involved. Danilo scared me some times. McKennie was wonderful either with getting the ball or setting up the offense.

"That was great performance, especially for the first match under a new coach. I really like the width and use of wingers. The defensive organisation is more orthodox and seems to work a lot better than under Sarri where opposing player at the far end was often unmarked. The rapid switching of play and more vertical approach helped open up Sampdoria. We’ve often struggled to open teams up, so very encouraging to see this. 

New signing had good games. McKennie looks great. Big, powerful, gets forward convincingly. If he carries on like this, our midfield is sorted.

Ronaldo had lots of service, which is a great change. Shame he was unlucky with most touches, but getting on the scoresheet was a positive. 

Very promising start!",g610lxx,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:54:37,spiz,2

"Only caught the second half, but the boys played extremely well; especially given that it was our first game back. The levels of fitness generally were also impressive.

It's much too early in the season to start getting over-excited or over-analytical, but for sure this Juve *appears* to be more relaxed and playing with more freedom than we have seen for a long time. The new inclusions- McKennie, Frabotta, Kulusevksi- all played well. Kulusevski especially looks quality. If he keeps getting better we are going to have an abundance of riches in attack- it even looks now like Douglas Costa wants some action.

On another note, it was fantastic to see Chiellini almost get the 90 minutes and play well. It proves a lot of the doubters wrong (including me) that his days are over.

This performance was very encouraging. Forza Juve!",g60z2sy,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:45:36,Lord_Maul,3

"We looked worse in the second half largely due to turnovers by the three Rs... Ramsey, Ronaldo and Rabiot. Theyre largely the creators so I am okay with that somewhat but we will need to tighten up a bit. Most of the turnovers just looked lazy or dumb. I think it may just be tired legs due to more pressing.

I think if Ronaldo had potted another one of his chances I'd sing a different tune, but he was not that great today. He looked far too selfish and turned the ball over too much because he didn't want to pass. Especially when we were up only 1-0 and he's trying to walk through everyone.

Really glad to have Chiello back. He put a lot of good tackles in.

I like how chances came from all over- Ronaldo, Mckennie, Bonucci, Kulu, Ramsey, Danilo, De Sciglio and Frabotta all had good looks.",g60yr3r,iwlr85,Juve,2020-09-21 04:43:44,JMM123,1

i would love to see aouar wearing the juve jersey, but imo it depends if pirlo wants to play with 2 or 3 CM, if he just wanta to play with 2 we would have too much CM, it costs more or less unnecessary money (as not everyone will be playing) and it would bring bad atmosphere when sb is not satisfied with the amount of play time",g58363j,isfdr9,Juve,2020-09-14 20:35:32,maxl44,10

"Keeping my impressions here pretty grounded since this is a friendly against Novara. Here's what I noted:

Really exciting to see McKennie/Kulusevski seem to incorporate into the team pretty seamlessly. Both played really well and looked sharp with the rest of the team.

I'm glad to also see Rabiot continuing his good form from last season, he's commanding in the midfield and we'll definitely rely on him as an anchor for as long as he plays well. Ramsey, Cuadrado, and Bentancur also looked pretty loose and comfortable, which is good.

The option to run a 3-5-2 I really like, I've always appreciated 3 defender formations, especially when the transition into defense is handled well. Having players like Sandro, Danilo, and Cuadrado definitely help in this regard. Having more midfielders seems to really help with the current squad, although it's not clear if we'll run this formation when Dybala is fit. For now, without a striker, it works well with Ronaldo/Kulusevski/etc. on top and with good support from the midfield. 

Pellegrini looked good going forward, but also looked pretty shakey defensively. It will be interesting to see how he is used and how he progresses with Juve. I could see him doing well as LWB.

Pjaca/Portanova/Nicolussi were all a nice surprise, they each had a handful of great moments and had decent games.

Douglas Costa didn't seem to be doing too well, made a lot of lazy mistakes. Didn't receive passes well and made stupid passes into high pressure, aside from his assist which was high risk and lucky to succeed. 

Arthur was solid but I'll always be comparing him to Pjanic, and comparably he didn't have too much of an impact. He was calm and collected, which is good anyways. 

Nothing notable but not necessarily bad from Danilo, Demiral, Rugani, De Sciglio, and the rest of the defense. They were only pressed a few times in the game so it's tough to get a pulse on how they might be playing. 

Overall a pretty promising display.",g54vnck,iruyx1,Juve,2020-09-14 01:31:05,jbogs7,4

Funny enough, Giroud have all this qualities and some.
He has played in top tier teams and is a proven international with the French national team ( and Juve always had good luck with french strikers....)

You have two giant attackers who have proven they are goal scoring machines... We were missing, last season, the goals from our midfield and not from our attackers.

I belive that once again the management are trying to learn from what purchases were made, in the last couple of seasons, and bring players who are either young and talented (Kulu and McKinnie) or proven (Arthur and hopefully Giroud) but most importantly both types of players are what the team needs and not a free transfer or an opportunity to sign a ""big name"".

"Barca fan here who regularly watches every game, I'll just say what I did on the main thread;

Most comments regarding how he's ""finished"" and whatnot are as spoiled bullshit as it can get. Suarez has been, and is better than most if not all strikers available in market right now, and whoever we'll get to replace him would simply not be as effective.

He can come up with 20+ goals despite not even playing the entire season. He can create goals out of nowhere with little service. He can assist like crazy as well. And he's been playing in Barcelona where we had no wingers to support him... Messi barely was in RW while our left winger was Griezmann.

If Juve has a proper attacking system which can utilize him, he'd do wonders for them. In Barca he plays out of his comfort zone yet still bangs goals after goals.

This season alone, despite being injured for majority of it + getting used to new management, he managed to do great in league all while still being our top scorer and joint top provider in UCL. Also our top scorer in UCL knockouts. Created goals out of ass against Inter, Bayern, etc etc.",g3vf9q8,ilqiex,Juve,2020-09-04 01:22:26,Shanal183,8

He’s not as good as he used to be but he’s nowhere near washed, and Serie A is the perfect place for him right now. Yes he’s old but people equating old to “can’t press” forget how old Mandzukic was when he played that LW role for us. Suarez actually has pretty good work rate and presses defenses. Last year, which was considered to be his worst year on a disastrous barca surrounded by only Messi and mediocrity, he still had 20+ goals and 10 assists.

"I’m worried we will fall in the same trap as Barca and other clubs... We are refusing to invest into our legacy of having players wanting to bleed for this club. 

Ever since Marchisio left and Khedira stopped playing game in game out (when fit) our midfield went to trash. We signed bandaids but what we were missing was establishing the next generation of the team, a new core.

We have now Arthur, Kulusevski, McKennie and Bentancur, to which I only believe 2/4 might do well and stay for a few seasons to form a core.

We need to stop focusing on investing into attack. We are scoring goals, Ronaldo is not disappointing when we funnel the ball to him. We need to invest in a proper right back and a midfielder to play the role that Pjanic did, deep lying playmaker. 

In the meantime, CR7 is with us another season at least. Lettuce invest in a striker in his mid twenties, fast, strong and most importantly a poachers eye, hell even if not fast or strong at least someone who will finish chances. Him, with Dybala, good 3 consistent midfielders in Arthur, Rabiot/Bentancur and Kulusevski/McKennie, De Ligt and x, Proper full backs and wingers, and this is a team that will last 5 years, and in case any one leaves to have succession plans in place",g3milnl,ikj4o8,Juve,2020-09-02 02:49:02,Cavyar,2

With the way Pirlo used  McKennie  I think he doesn't intend to build a strong technical midfield instead a high work rate midfield to cover as much as ground as possible with two players then overwhelms opposition team with 4 attackers,gah3y0f,jjxf3w,Juve,2020-10-29 17:48:28,aqua2nd,5

"Some points:   

Chiesa was playing alone for most of the game. In the second half he barely touched the ball. Idk if it's him or his teammates who are ignoring him.

Our attack was very predictable because it always came from the right flank. 

Bentancur looked very poor on the ball.

Kulusevski looked scared to play this match and made too many technical mistakes.   

It can't be only unluck the fact that Morata always is offside. He needs to work on that. He's fundamental though. Without him we'd be way more lost.

Dybala looked poor. I hope he'll quickly gain form.

Our midfield in general looked very weak, especially in passing and controlling the ball. We can't afford to not play Ramsey atm, especially since Arthur is not yet integrated.

About the subs:
McKennie in the few minutes summed up his style. Energetic but very raw technique-wise and not always concentrated.
Bernardeschi is a completely lost player. Mentally he's not professional level anymore.   
Arthur has the talent but needs to work a lot on his workrate and personality on the pitch. It kind of looks like he doesn't care a lot",gagzn6e,jjxf3w,Juve,2020-10-29 16:26:06,Ceccoso1,10

"I don't think we were outplayed that badly and we were definitely very unlucky. 

But yeah, Pirlo's bound to have some difficulties seeing this is his first time as a coach. I was actually very surprised at how well he started and was seemingly able to implement some of his ideas and tactics already. 

We're still a work in progress and even though this loss shouldn't have really happened considering their form, Barca are still very dangerous when their opponents let them play their game like we did tonight. I like that we're playing with more freedom under Pirlo and that has led to us being able to control games more than we did under Sarri, which is kinda a paradox when you think about it, but we still need to be a lot sharper both on and off the ball.",gagpkhs,jjxf3w,Juve,2020-10-29 13:29:33,rndmlgnd,-3

"Lol the overreactions are pretty insane. 

I thought Juve looked pretty great, and unsurprisingly, they looked terrific in the counter. 

Barca scored off a penalty and a deflected shot, Move on. 

Morata was CLEARLY offside on all three of his goals. This has been a constant problem for him. Had a good game tho.

I hope games like this shows Dybala fans why Dybala isn't close to being the most important player on the team. It wasn't true last year. It will never be true as long as Ronaldo is here. He struggles playing deep and loses possessions constantly in dangerous areas. This has been a huge issue LAST season, but people just don't seem to notice it. 

I honestly think Juve would've destroyed Barca if Ronaldo was playing. Some of these crosses and counterattacks were absolutely lethal. 

Midfielders were mostly underwhelming tho.

He makes it abit difficult for pirlo's philosophy by not going for the ball.  
Ramsey , kulu , morata , chiesa are all great with qyick gameplay and can contribute well to the defensive phase and can recover the ball quickly by pressing high . While dybala lose posession easily and doesn't press or track back",gafz308,jjxf3w,Juve,2020-10-29 08:46:35,juvejuventus10,6
"Ay, hard to assess this game. We were not great, we were not awful - it might as well have ended as a victory for us but turned out to be a 2:0 loss instead.

I'm obviously disappointed with the result but as controversial as it might sound, I'm glad this was a UCL Group game, and not a Serie A game. From the 'points' point of view, these 2 games seem to not be very important so keep your heads up lads.

The good:

\- I could see some hunger in our players - nice change to the 19/20 season,

\- Danilo - CONTROVERSIAL!!! Even though it wasn't a good game for him, he is consistently performing better than last season which is nice because I had very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very low expectations for him and I am genuinely, positively surprised,

\- Morata is really impressive - I mean, he takes all the created chances and bangs them into the net. Of course, it would be better if we could cut his toes off so all these goals will actually matter but still - you can't deny his finishing skills. If Barcelona was as effective as him, we would concede more goals tonight,

\- Cuadrado - I understand a lot of us can be disappointed with his performance, but with lack of actual leadership in our team, his overall involvement stands out, his passes were not some random, safe ball strokes and I think he is a key player this season. I don't know if it's just me, but when he has a ball, I just have this feeling that he is actually thinking through options and applies some tactics instead of bashing the ball wherever it's convenient,

\- Szczęsny - solid, but unlucky performance. I can imagine this would be 0:3/0:4 with Kepa or same bad-day-de Gea.

The bad:

\- Berna &amp; Pirlo - personally, I love Berna, he seems to be a wholesome person with bianconeri heart but how underperforming he has to be for Pirlo not to bring him on the pitch?,

\- Chiesa - often too selfish which leads to ball losses. I'm confident this selfishness and his undeniable talent will bring some goals this season but in the great scheme of things, it will be more harmful than rewarding for the team,

\- Demiral - might be a great defender but he needs to take into account that given current situation (injuries in defense), it's just unwise to get a red card. It was a risky situation but **not** that risky to justify the foul. IMHO he shouldn't have made that tackle (both yellow cards were justified). Still, I'm just criticizing the tackle decision, his skills are undeniable,

"Ok so i calmed down a little and here are my main disappointments: 

# Pirlo has been tactically outplayed: 

It was obvious since the first 15 minutes that Sergio Roberto was given a strict defensive role to keep Chiesa under control, which he accomplished it perfectly. 

A defensive Midfield of Rabiot and Bentancur **CANNOT WORK** with Dybala in the middle, that was the hope initially but Dybala kept drafting to the right because he become completely absent in the middle, this made Kulusuveski obsolete, so in my opinion, if you are gonna play with Benta and Rabiot, then you should start with Ramsey in the middle. 

#Pirlo made the worst subs since our super cup final against Lazio

McKenni instead Kulusevski ? really ?? i really wasn't believing my eyes when i saw that kid running on the left lane... when i saw him i was 100% expecting Ramsey to replace Rabiot too, but in the lineup McKenni will cover his natural position, Ramsey will play forward and Dybala and Chiese would take the wings. 

Also why on earth Frabotta wasn't subbed in ? i think we can all agree that 60 minutes of Danilo is enough torture for all of us. 

And then Bernar-fucken-deschi... i really hope this low-iq cunt is sold by January.

#Dybala 

He was burried today, and the main reason was because Barcelona defense were comfortable to send 2 or 3 guys at once to get the ball from him knowing that his passing options are very limited (Kulu and Cuadrado usually behind him, and Chiesa and Morata are in the other side of the pitch, with Rabiot and Bentancur giving fuck all threat offensively), so yeah, please stop playing him like this, he should be the main focus of the team, we should not be wasting Dybala to find a spot for Kulusuvski, althou today was a good chace to try a 4-4-2 formation

#Morata

Am really happy we have him, he's been unlucky today, but fuck it, he had 3 chances in which he scored every one of them. 

#Overall 

yes the result is harsh, and i am a bit angry at Pirlo, specially for some **obvious** mistakes, i do appreciate his attempt to give Bernardschi his confident but not when you are down 1-0, i still cannot comprehend the McKenni sub though. 

With that said, we scored 3 goals that rejected by VAR, the 5-pixel kind of offside which teams in the past has been getting away with all the time, still not an excuse for a 0-2 loss in our home, Pirlo deserves an [F-] score tonight to be honest, hopefully he'll learn from this mistake and only get better.

"The first one - during match it took 3 minutes for the VAR decision to be made. To me it looked like they were trying to find that 1 frame where his little toe was 1 mm offside.  With how log the ball is on the foot of the player who is passing, that is several frames to choose from. Especially since there was no slowmo replay provided, just 1 stopframe.

Also same game, straight red for Chiesa for no offense at all, which is a perfect situation for VAR review.

I believe that VAR is getting very bad rep (and rightlously so) because it stil leaves way too much room for interpretation and way too often it looks like the VAR referees can make decision in whichever way he likes and will still be able to find reasonable arguments for it.",ga7q2wf,jigy3u,Juve,2020-10-27 06:35:27,Stonecrush1,3

"Been the same problem with every result like this for the last 3 years. Lack of urgency, bad decision-making, and just all round total failure to move for each other and make the runs. Kiev, Crotone and Verona are not world class opponents and all of them repelled most of our attacks easily. 

I see people having a go at Pirlo but it’s too early for me to start doing that, this squad has fundamental flaws that would scupper any manager coming in, there is an abject lack of pace, we still lack the quality in the midfield to pass round any sort of press, but worst of all there is an attitude problem, we saw it at the back of Allegri’s reign, we saw it with Sarri, and we are seeing it here. Too many players walking, too many back passes, not enough players getting into space to make something happen. The team puts their head down so quickly and we just seem to play such pedestrian fucking football for most of the first 60 minutes of a match. 

Pirlo’s number one priority isn’t tactical, and in fairness he’s recognised this from the off...it’s finding a way to get these players to remember who they fucking play for - a shameful performance tonight, didn’t start playing with any urgency until we went 1-0 down.

The first things is obviously Ronaldo missing. Over the past years the team has become a bit to dependend on him I think. Then there is the rest of our injuries, De Ligt, Chiellini and Alex Sandro are pretty big missers I think. And ofcourse Pirlo is still figuring everything out.

There where also some possitive things today. I thought Rabiot in particular played quite a nice game. For the last 15 minutes the team turned into some out of control beast which looked really good Imo. I hope we can take the Barcelona game from there and continue playing more like that.

"Dybala did extremely well considering his long absence, in fact he was one of very few that actually fired any shots out and was unlucky to bag two. Full grinta, the guy's a legend.

I agree with the comments on Berna. Like the guy but he's just not a Juve starter. Feel like it's Rugani all over again. Kulu must start at all times, and if he needs to be rested, we need Chiesa on the ground.

Arthur is a beast. Most technically gifted player I've seen in a Juve shirt in a long time. Seems to do it effortlessly. Saw some one twos with Dybala that give hope for the future.

Officiating was terrible again. Serie A squads have figured out how to beat Juve: park the bus and hack legs like no tomorrow. 

Finally, hard to tell what's going on with Pirlo. Starts Berna and waits a long time to sub him off. Playing Arthur, Rabiot, Dybala and Ramsey for 90 minutes just 2 days before the Barça game.

We've seen how pressing and fun to watch this team can be, but they started being that way too late. If we played first half like that last 15 minutes, the game would be over by then.

"Serious genuine question for the people who either wanna sack Pirlo or are already starting to think about it: Do you think Juve have regressed? 

I think lots of people are turning against the idea of “attacking” football even though I feel like we’ve been seeing performances more or less exactly like this AT LEAST since Ronaldo’s arrival if not the season before as well, including under the very balanced Allegri. Only difference was instead of a random 85’ penalty or goal we hit the post twice and got nailed by VAR. In the Roma and Crotone games we looked completely disorganized defensively but I think we looked much better vs Kyiv and today (only conceded bc of berna’s terrible mistake).

We haven’t progressed, but have we really regressed to the point where we just HAVE to pull the plug? I don’t think so. Between COVID, players missing, tight schedule, and no preseason, I honestly think the most surprising part of the season is that we haven’t lost yet. I think Pirlo needs more time because he’s shown an ability to at least make adjustments and improvements. The defensive scheme has improved a lot since the season started, and I think the full strength XI with Ronaldo and Chiesa and De Ligt back will play well.",ga3w14p,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 06:12:12,jct1121,5

Dybala is not in form yet and the truth is if we want to get rid of Bernardeschi he has to play, we have to try and get something out of him in terms of decent performances that we can use as a bait to sell him off, and these are the games where he should play, i don't expect to see him in the lineup against barca.",ga5v07h,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 21:00:16,Hand_Sanitizer3000,2
"All of the berna talk aside, from what I saw in the second half, we really needed benta subbed in. Both arthur and rabiot were playing well but rabiot's work rate seemed to be dropping. A rabiot-benta sub would have really helped, imo.",ga659ub,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 22:41:41,callycaggles,2
"We lacked urgency until the 70th minute.

- Dybala looked very very rusty for a good portion of the game.

- Arthur needs to start dictating tempo more. I'm not sure if it's because Pirlo is telling him not to, but he isn't linking up the defense with everyone else like Pjanic did. He's good at shielding the ball but he's just not as involved as I'd want him to be.

- Morata played very well, I forgot how good his linkup play is. He was basically the only consistent player moving forward for most of the game. Unlucky that he didn't get a goal.

- Kulu needs to start every game. Please keep Berna off the field before the 70th minute, we have two new wingers that are just hands down better than he is.

- Cuadrado is so bad once he's tired it's painful to watch.

- We need Ronaldo.

Basically all I got from this game.",ga3tn2p,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 05:51:39,Misdefined,3

"Why people complaining? Chill, its still early of the season. I think we play well. 1 goal, 1 dissallowed goal, 2 hit the post. We can score 4 but just unlucky. Verona doesn't test our GK that much either. Berna needs to go. Stop wasting time on him and better spend that time on developing Frabotta. That's the only downsided we have in this game. Others are solid enough for me.",ga3unsj,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 06:00:36,Sarcastic_Mr_Fox,3
"Bernardeschi has only proved how worthless he truly is to this team. When was his last good game? Atletico 2018? He needs to move on, it's become obvious for quite some time.

The team itself is disgraceful to say the least. Struggling to find any attacking prowess versus even the weakest of times and relying on individual talent or some call to get us through.

Bonucci and cuadrado are useless as footballers on this team. Yes Cuadrado makes SOME good plays, every once in a blue moon but so what. His decision making is awful and he's in no way a quality player. Bonucci is awful and should not be starting it's as simple as that.",ga3w53z,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 06:13:03,Mous15,3

"While it may be easy to focus on individual players, it is hard to ignore the fact that we played 70 minutes of football that is not sustainable for the long term future of the club. 

Pirlo simply must develop a style that deals with teams that have an ultra high press. Playing out from the back is nice to watch but it risks far too much, and I do not trust our players as we do not have Xavi, Iniesta, Alves etc linking up with our defenders. 

The team without a doubt know how to play more direct football than last year under Sarri, 100%, and Pirlo can be praised for that. We need to get them playing inventive balls in the final third like we saw towards the end of the game when we created a few chances. There is some optimism (from myself) that playing style can exist for Juve, but it needs more thought into adapting the style to the opponent.",ga5abhm,ji1v3g,Juve,2020-10-26 15:15:39,stripedspoon,1

Individually they don’t play a bad game but how is this possible that we don’t create much offensively for the third year in a row? 6 points out of 12 (I don’t count the gift of Napoli) is not acceptable.

"1. I liked how Bentancur stayed in the back while Rabiot went to pressure up high, the team looked more balanced that way, also giving more free space for Ramsey to work. Although it wasn't Bentancur's best game.
2. Chiesa on the LWB was a nightmare for Dinamo, but I wonder if against a team like Barcelona he would be able to play such an attacking football.
3. Finally, another player that can head the ball other than Cristiano. Great match for Morata.
4. How did Barcelona accept Pjanic for Arthur? Arthur seems to have glue on his feet, his control on the ball is crazy.

"Much better defensive performance from us this game. Obviously still holes, but generally we resisted well. Kiev really amped up pressure the last 15 mins and we had some close moments then. 

**Sloppy analysis:**

Chiesa is great, needs to be a little less selfish at times and hold on to the ball less when in the box. You could tell he wanted to score. But he was torching the wing and is not afraid to go head to head against defenders, even when outnumbered. Great performance overall. 

Ramsey good, had some dangerous/shit crosses that lead to a loss of possession.

Morata looked so so in the buildup on but he scored when it was required of him. 

Cuadrado played very well, good crosses and defensive clearances at times. You could tell the yellow neutered him though. 

Benta had a bad game

Rabiot some moments of good movement, not his best game not his worst. He kinda ruined that chance in the box. 

Arthur is silky smooth on the ball, he needs to work better on his distribution though. Maintaining possession is only good if it actually leads to offensive/attacking phases. 

Kulu had some nice moments, I don’t think he played in an ideal role which hampered him. 

Bonucci solid all things considered. 

Time for Gigio to start off the bench, he can’t be dependend on health wise 😭

We’re too card happy right now, we need to work on that or we’ll keep risking the loss of players mid game. Pointless tackles left and right, that Demiral one was reckless though I appreciated the enthusiasm.

"Finally getting to watch the match. Random postmatch observations in no particular order: 

1. Bentancur offers nothing except picking up a yellow, bad giveaways, and giving up freekicks in dangerous areas. 
2. Chiesa is making me eat my words. A bit too selfish at times maybe, but at least he  is eager to take guys on and attack.
3. attack attack attack. Please. Felt like we scored and then slacked off for far too long in the 2nd half instead of pressing and putting the game away. 
4. Morata has his confidence apparently. 
5. Chiellini is done as an every-game player I fear. Love him, but with his fitness issues he's just not dependable. 
6. we almost got burned MULTIPLE times with bad giveaways and failure to clear the ball defensively. Need to clean that shit up. 
7. Thank CHRIST we didn't see Cuadrado on the left. Chiesa looked real good out there. 
8. Rabiot did the dirty work in midfield well. People will say he was invisible, but I completely disagree.
9. Kuvu was.

"1. Bentancur was utterly ineffective. Arthur should always be a starter, in my opinion. His possession keeping and dribbling ability is too important, and he will only get better. Bentancur should have been subbed off way sooner.
2. Chiesa had an amazing game and seems like he can play really great on the left as a LWB. Cutting into the box like he was born to do it, and showed great skill which helped lead to a goal.
3. Morata is becoming a goal-scoring machine.

"Decent match. We need McKennie back so we can rotate more in midfield. Bentancur looked really tired and made mistakes. Pirlo corrected the issue from the Crotone game and played Demiral on the right and Danilo on the left (Demiral has no left foot). But Pirlo was slow on making the subs for Bentancur and Ramsey, who had looked exhausted for 5-10 minutes before subbed. Dynamo had the upper hand during that period, and a better team would have scored. We still aren’t creating enough chances, and I think that’s down to not having a LWB that can threaten to cross from the left, which makes our attack a bit unbalanced and predictable. But that’s all nitpicking, because an away win against the 3rd best team in the group is a solid result when we’re still missing a number of starters.",g9gnp74,jevwxs,Juve,2020-10-21 03:12:40,carlinisgod77,2

"Some thoughts: Rabiot and Benta are too similar, we need Arthur who is sadly irreplaceable to play pretty much always and be an anchor while Benta/Rabiot/Berna/Khedira rotate around him, since he's the only guy with magnets for feet.



Ramsey is like a whole new player under Pirlo, super happy for him and I'm glad we have him.



Happy to see Dybala have a run, he's clearly rusty but this was a great way to shake off the cobwebs. 


Chiesa man, holy shit... sure he goes alone and fucks up sometimes but he'll learn and shit, I bet he'll end up scoring some incredible solo goals for us. So promising.



Overall a pretty poopy first half followed by a better second half against a team that clearly didn't have confidence and was pretty much in awe of us despite the fact we're in a transition period. Pirlo is hitting the ground running and I'm sure he's learning a lot from these first few experiments as a Juve coach.


Future still looks bright, fuck the haters.

Fuck the ref. Arguably the worst officiating performance ever,g950tsq,jd2sbi,Juve,2020-10-18 04:44:33,_ForzaJuve_,76
"Not gonna comment that bullshit refereeing, but in short...

The good:

* Morata - shown a really big improvement from the last game
* Chiesa - great until that bullshit call, really devastating to see his debut ruined
* Cuadrado - one of the most consistent players we have
* Rabiot - big stabilizing factor, at this form he should be an undisputable starter
* Arthur - surprised me how press resistant he is, reminds me of Modric in that aspect

The bad:

* Portanova - just no
* Bonucci - again didn't waste an opportunity to remind us how mediocre he is when he has to command the defence
* Bernardesci - seriously? This seemed like a golden opportunity, I really don't see him getting any minutes once Sandro is back

The ugly:

* The ref - fuck you
* Crotone's butchers, divers and actors - really sad to see so much foul play go unpunished

I really hope Pirlo has gotten all needed ""preseason"" data and has a clearer picture of the future team. Some players are just constantly underperforming and shouldn't even come close to the first team once everyone is back to full health. Also hope we seriously shift gears in the next few weeks, a lot of points have already been dropped...",g952m2n,jd2sbi,Juve,2020-10-18 04:57:40,grdivrag,49

They spent five minutes to look at individual frames, trying to find a ""questionable"" one (ball seems like it left Cuadrado (?) + Morata 1mm offside) and then *embellished* it.

When you have to do that, you don't know for sure because we are talking about frames per second, and when you don't know for sure, the rules state you have to award the goal.

No VAR for the penalty and the red card, five minutes to cheat Juventus out a win.

I think this 3CB experiment is clearly not working. The only player to clearly benefit from the switch is Danilo (less pressure on him as a CB and fewer mistakes as a result). The squad doesn't have enough depth on the wings to keep it as the main formation. Plus (my personal opinion) all the midfielders are better suited to a 3-man midfield.,g953fx3,jd2sbi,Juve,2020-10-18 05:03:55,pliqtro,8

"Well, my thoughts are: Bentancur should always be a starter, and he should be accompanied by Rabiot or McKennie not Arthur since his defensive skills are not the best for a double 5 imo. I would like to see Arthur play in front of the two midfielders as the link between the midfield and the forwards. The ball was basically glued to Arthur's feet so I think a more attacking position for him would be lovely to watch. I liked Frabotta alot, but not Portanova, and I would've prefered if Cuadrado started this match over Chiesa since I saw that he's still not in sync with his defensive duties (which is obvious since he has just arrived).

"You have to respect the opposition, even if it's a 0/9 Crotone. Starting 2 youth players (with one debuting) on the left side is very risky. And it clearly didn't work, we completely ignored our left side on offense.

Apart from that the game went kinda as expected, a lot of new &amp; young players who struggled somewhat. Chiesa and Kulu need to remember they actually have teammates now that can do something, so stop forcing everything and play a ball to a teammate. And our defense is still problematic, we looked WAY to open against a relegation team. Gives little to no confidence heading into a busy CL schedule.

To end, that ref should never be allowed to see Serie A action ever again.",g951to3,jd2sbi,Juve,2020-10-18 04:51:56,Babostainer,5

Now, he's bang average and this new guy is electric, not even considering the usual competition he has for a place in the team. It's just sad how he was unable to make the next step.

People who say that this team won't win the Champions League also don't realize that this team probably isn't even good enough to win the league.

They got screwed by Corona virus and however they handled it they would not have had the problem if not for the virus.

We also do not need to be handed points that we don't earn on the pitch. We are better than teams like Inter because we embody fair play and respect while they will do anything to grab a bit of glory. Lets not lose our identity over a match we would have no fear contesting on the pitch.",g8togpl,jb2vwd,Juve,2020-10-15 03:05:40,MoneyBadgerEx,4

"Can I just say...players with this kind of attitude are the reason (amongst, admittedly, some others) that the club has stagnated over the last few years. There have been too many passengers in this squad, lacking work ethic and enthusiasm, at the club for the pay check and winning relaxing and easy league titles. I’m glad a lot of that deadwood is being cleared, but more needs to be done.

People can scream “contract contract” but if we want Juventus, our Juventus, to win in Europe we have to go up several levels. We can’t have passengers who view the club as a retirement home. We need work ethic, youth and quality. 

Pirlo has made a good start on that front, because I was worried Higuain was going to do what Khedira is doing but to his credit he left and hasn’t tarnished his reputation. 

For better or worse, this is a new Juve with a young and dominant manager with his own ideas and we need workers and collective sacrifice and motivation, not leeches living at J-Medical or playing twice a season.",g7u5nvh,j5ozzo,Juve,2020-10-06 06:17:14,Lord_Maul,0
Yeah Khedira hasn’t been the best the past 2 years but he was a very good player for us when he was at his best. I’m kind of tired of seeing clubs force out their veteran players like what Barca did with Suarez and Rakitic just because they weren’t the best players anymore. Yeah it’s good to get players for the future and it’s better to get rid of an injury prone player but they should treat him with respect and make the best of him while they can.

I think if not for COVID we wouldn't have signed him for that much. We ended the financial year 75m in the red so we don't have the luxury of splashing a lot of cash for players.

It feels like we're paying for the privilege of only spending 2m for the first season, 8m for the second season of his loan. After that point, 50m amortised over 3 years is very manageable. It's basically a non-liquid loan we're getting from Fiorentina.

"I wouldn’t discount the role that Juve’s increasingly small presence in the national team setup played in this transfer. Ofc if Chiesa actually becomes Berna 2.0 then Paratici deserves all the criticism he gets, but let’s give the kid a chance. He seems a really quick, hardworking player. He’s versatile. He needs to work on his decision making and end product, but those things tend to get better when the players around you are better. He can obviously play as an attacker or as a wingback and I think he can basically become Cuadrado on steroids for us.

"I'm still confused, because of all of the back-and-forth sh\*t talking between both sides. 

Can someone ELI5 this with solid facts so we can all come to an understanding, more reasoning and less sh\*t-slugging please?

Here is my ELI5 reasoning please correct me if I'm wrong:

Napoli: We have a problem, we have two(?) positive cases and are not allowed to embark on our travel. Can we please postpone? Here's proof of our inability to travel as per the local health authority ""ASL"". \*Napoli document that you've seen floating around on twitter, and on the media (TV) yesterday evening.\*

Lega Calcio: No you must proceed to the match as per schedule. Not showing up without justifiable reason, will result in a forfeit 3-0 for your opponents.

Juventus: 'k we're going to the stadium. See you @ 20.45.

Napoli: WTF? We have 2 cases and are concerned about the safety of everyone. And what part of travel ban did you guys not understand?

Lega Calcio: What travel ban? Who's stopping you? ASL cannot restrict your movement throughout the country.

Napoli: If we travel then we will be held liable as per local health authority. It's like committing a crime.

Lega Calcio: There is no such liability. Attend the game or suffer the consequences of a forfeit.

Juventus: Hey Napoli you're breaching the rules here. We're ready for a game here, and you did not show up.

Demiral, De Ligt, Sandro

Danilo, Bonucci, Chiellini

Problem is the FB/WB situation. There's only Cuadrado and I guess Bernardeschi.

RWB: Cuadrado (defensive), RM (offensive)

LWB: LB/Frabotta (defensive), Berna (offensive)

As it is now, Sandro probably starts at LWB (with De Sciglio covering his spot as a joint CB), but suffice to say I'd much rather have a real LB backup instead of De Sciglio. Someone like Pellegrini would've been nice to have, honestly...

On the other side, Cuadrado doesn't have a reliable backup. Danilo and De Sciglio are more defensive options, while Douglas/Kulu/Berna tend to cut inside, which goes against the purpose of that role.",g7emavg,j3snj9,Juve,2020-10-02 22:40:46,ddom94,1
"I'd imagine you're correct in assuming that when Alex Sandro returns from injury, he may be transitioned into becoming our LCB like Danilo has at RCB. And to be honest, it might be necessary because the lack of pace from Bonucci/Chiellini was pretty apparent versus Roma. 

So as options to fill 3 spots, we'd effectively have Chiellini, Bonucci, De Ligt, Danilo, Sandro, and Demiral. 

The problem with putting Sandro at LCB is that leaves us pretty dire for wingbacks, so we may see some more experimenting at that position until we either revert formation or find something that works. 

Pirlo should be starting Frabotta so long as he shows what he already has. When Sandro/De Ligt come back, we'll have more depth and options across the entire back line.",g7er84a,j3snj9,Juve,2020-10-02 23:23:48,jbogs7,1

"Sure we do. De Light is soon back, and we haven’t even needed to utilise Demiral yet. Danilo as CB has been good and appears well suited to this kind of game. Remember that the 3 at the back is the formation in the attacking phase (3-2-5) - we defend with 4 (a standard 4-4-2 with some interesting work by the pivots). Danilo can be the 3rd CB, or push up to be the 5th attacker as he did to assist Ronaldo last week. Sandro could also be more restrained going forward if necessary to be the 3rd CB. That help us get options wide to help skip the first defensive line - something that was a problem against Roma, likely because of the use of “inverted” wings (on top of some poor play be Rabiot and McKennie). 

Frabotta is someone to keep an eye on. He’s not great, but could turn out to be a valuable backup.",g7httat,j3snj9,Juve,2020-10-03 15:43:02,spiz,1
"Demiral is unproven in this type of setup? Lol do you think he's never played in a 3atb? He's a centreback, if he can't play with 2 other centrebacks, he doesn't deserve to play professionally. There are so very few CBs who can't play well in a 3atb formation. Not a remotely valid point.

"One thing that has been on my mind: I wonder if Juve would be playing better if we had fans in the stadiums. Like, maybe mentally having the crowds keeps them amped and going, even when they want to get lethargic.

"Our only threats are Ronaldo and Morata. I miss the days of having midfielders that are actually threatening. Compare Rabiot who's an expert at losing the ball stupidly with Vidal, Pogba, Marchisio, prime Khedira. We need a proper box to box midfielder that can make runs and score. We're never going to win when all it takes for teams to shut us down is to keep one or two players in their pocket.

This is an absolute disgrace and an embarrassment. I love how Morata rants about learning and growing since his time from juve but he is still a petulant emotional child. Great goal he scored, almost makes up for the point blank header he somehow missed.

"Sarri and Pirlo have made me miss Allegri so much. I’m fully willing to eat crow bc I was so done with him by the end of his career at Juve, I wanted to see some nice attacking football. We took for granted that Conte and Allegri basically made us get to used to the idea that Juve will not ever concede a goal to these bottom feeder teams. Now, it didn’t always look or feel like we’d score much ourselves but you just never felt in danger of not getting 3 points somehow. Last two years but obviously especially this year we just feel so unpredictable, so NOT solid. I wouldn’t mind that if we were exciting going forward but we’re only a bit better going forward than Allegri’s last Juve, and so much worse defensively/tactically. Also, when we ditched him for Sarri he was saying the team needed a rebuild, he’s clearly been proven correct. I hate to see us be so dependent on a single player (as much as I love ronaldo and as amazing as he is), because right now without Ronaldo I don’t have confidence in this team vs anyone. Sucks to admit that but it’s true. With Ronaldo, I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if we beat Barcelona. But the way he papers over the cracks is exposed when we play actually good teams. I think sacking Pirlo would still be a hugely drastic and unwise decision, but I’m not feeling optimistic about this team right now.",gdx2wua,k2tg4y,Juve,2020-11-29 04:26:23,jct1121,11

"It's been two and a half years now since this team played decent football. Allegri's last year, Sarri's year, and now Pirlo's team.

We just need to face the facts. This team is simply not good. It hasn't been in a long time. Club leadership continually fails this squad with inexperienced managers who haven't proven anything. The squad knows it too. Dybala is never in a position to succeed. Forwards are bought and overpaid ad-nauseum that do nothing for our true problems at mid and fullback. Players completely stopped developing (bentancur hasn't gotten better in 2 years after a bright start.)

The defense always lets in a goal to any team. Every game the other team will score a goal. We can never grind out a 1-0 win nor can we win 4-0. We play the same every game - play well, half time, play shit, maybe get a lucky goal or Ronaldo carries.

The team just isn't good. It's failed the eye test for years now with multiple managers and the results are finally coming in.",gdwqrp9,k2tg4y,Juve,2020-11-29 03:16:43,BabyGronk8778,8
"I think the main issue is still that the teams creativity is on the wings. Our players are too slow in the center of the field, and not enough players make runs off the ball. Just watch the forwards of Juve during buildup vs Benevento - the difference was pretty significant. You don't need world class talent in order to create chances if the players are simply there and moving and creating change in the shape of both teams. They're hungry for it and we're simply not.

It's getting so old watching our wingbacks or wingers just run up the side of the pitch doing nothing because the rest of our team is on snooze. It feels like every player is waiting for the next to make something happen. Earlier in the season they did well to turn into the center of the field where they were being supported but I don't see that anymore. When guys like Ronaldo, Chiesa, Kulusevski, and Dybala make inward runs off of Morata and other central players, is when things happen for us. We have good dribblers. We need to be doing that 75%+ of the time, defenses will eventually break to that. They're not going to break to the 20th lazy cross to 1 attacker in the box. 

That, or we need to do a better job of being patient with possession but that comes to the other big issue - the horrendous quality of passing. We're making really shitty passes into pressure in the hope that we can create something, because let's be honest, we're not creating anything elsewhere. When De Ligt or Bonucci send a dart from the back line, it can work, but it can't be a main source of creativity. I think if the target is someone like Morata who is a good target man, that's ok and can and has worked. But we're trying to do that almost every possession and it more often than not leads to a quick turnover which leads into a counter. It seems like instruction for when the attack stalls, but I think we're resorting to it too often and too quickly. 

I think the time for experimenting should have passed for Pirlo by now. And listen, I believe in adjusting strategy depending on the opposing team, but by now we should 100% have a dependable starting formation and lineup we can default to in times like this and it seems like we don't? I want to believe in Pirlo because we've seen some sparks of promise, but it's December in a few days and we're still drawing against Serie B teams and relying on last minute theatrics for a win...",gdwwyhy,k2tg4y,Juve,2020-11-29 03:52:57,jbogs7,4

Bernardeschi looked like one of the few that actually gave a fuck. Can’t fault him here.

"Hi there, welcome to the post match thread. I don't know about you but I woke up in the middle of the night to watch Juve stomp Benevento. I can't honestly put into words how frustrated and nauseous I actually feel watching Juve play now. Good God, everyone sucked. So many misplaced passes, chances given up. It's actually rediculous. These players are getting paid an actual absurd amount of money to perform, not to have consistent awful games. Serie A 9 times, advancing so far in the champions league, and expecting to do so again this year, and we play a U23 player, and other players that have no business being on the field.  Dybala has no business wearing the Captain armband. Ronaldo shouldn't have to bail the team out. Excuses are there like the ref sucking, or Benevento falling over like leaves in the wind, but it shouldn't matter for the top team in Serie A. Cap it off with a red card.

"Key takeaways:

- Either Dybala seriously reinvents himself or he should be benched indefinitely. It's like playing with 10 players when he is on the field. He and Morata are the bulk of the offense, the latter is performing, Paolo isn't. 

- Juventus have a mentality problem against small teams. Crotone, Verona and now Benevento. These teams play their best football shading us but it's as if Juventus team doesn't realize their quality is significantly inferior. Go be creative, insistent, arrogant.. for fucks sake, you're not earning millions to match the performance of a serie B team. This goes for half the squad. 

- Bernardeschi is trying but he's just not Juventus quality. Bentancur and Rabiot actually have good games but are so fucking inconsistent like today that it's very hard to relie on them. One day there elite level the other they're farmer league level.

- 4-4-2 and transition to 3-4-2-1 isn't working. Pirlo should try to experiment with a 4-2-3-1, make Kulusecski a CAM, bench Dybala, Morata up top. Our midfielders are OK in the defensive phase, so it makes sense to just stick two of them there. Box to box midfielders aren't working for us, make the wingers push the ball up the field and make the front four triangulate as much as possible with support from the wing backs.",gdwqxq4,k2tg4y,Juve,2020-11-29 03:17:58,dudeinred69,4

He clearly has a vision of how he thinks football should be played but he seems to be having a very difficult time implementing that style onto this squad. I’m not exactly pining for the Allegri days because I’m a dumb purist and believe winning cups can be achieved via attacking football. That said, this is a poor alignment of the talent available and a lackluster vision for the team from our manager IMO. Obviously he’s having to deal with an unprecedented amount of fixtures in a given time span because of COVID. Having said all that; IMO too many players are being asked to play in roles/positions that they haven’t done at the top flight. I’m willing to give Pirlo time but that means not winning a 10th scudetto consecutively, it probably means getting knocked out of the the champions league in the round of 16 (barring some sort of Zidane-esque man motivation around European cup ties/a favorable draw) and it also comes with the added risk of him not being *that good* as a top tier manager given the time. My overall point is that Ronaldos window is closing every second, there’s only so much time we have with him, at this level, on the books. We need to be in a *WIN NOW* mindset. Was Pirlo the best choice for that? I think not...but he has time to learn on the job...hopefully ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",gdypjv2,k2tg4y,Juve,2020-11-29 10:08:28,NoNoNoNoNoNowhy,1

"I don't know why this subreddit is scared to give the problem a name. It's our coach Pirlo. Every match this subreddit tries to find a scapegoat. That one game it's berna, the other Bonucci, Dybala seems to be a piece of shit according to this sub, benta is playing bad, Sandro is slow and the list goes on. We can't just rely on Morata and Ronaldo. Even if both are not playing, we got a quality team which at least should win against benvento or crotone (no disrespect to both teams).

We have no game plan. Most goals are scored after some player on the wings (probably cuadrado) crosses the ball and morata and ronaldo somehow but that thing in. We're totally lost in midfield and in the center. The player don't know where to go and often 2 players are in the same spot for whatever reasons. Right now we only got 7 goals against us (best defense with verona), so that can't be the problem. Pirlo maybe will become the best coach on earth someday (I really hope that) but right now it was a dumb move to sack Sarri and give somebody who hasn't coached a single match the oppurtunity to coach Juve.

Or the teammanagers should stop talking shit and saying that they want to win the 10th Scudetto in a row and start to say clearly that 'this year is a rebuild year and we try to get a CL spot for next year'. It's a hard season for everybody playing the EL and CL, 4 Games in 2 Weeks is not easy. But it's not accetable how we are performing recently.",ge0dcdn,k2r27y,Juve,2020-11-29 18:12:45,Grumpy23,1

Cuadrado is immense.  he made so many runs behind the D like that and he kept getting missed.  At 93rd minute he is still making runs like that.   Most concerning this match was Kulu and Chiesa.

"People mistake a great performance by the other team for a poor one by us. Ferencvaros knew exactly what they had to do once they were 1-0 up due to a stupidly lucky goal, and they almost did it. It's not easy for any team to break down such defensive stability. We weren't great, but we had our moments, and at the end of the day, we dominated the game and deserved the win. We did scrape by, but that was more through the other team's strength (in this match, usually they are not this good) than through our faults. Had Ferencvaros not scored first, I don't think the game would've went this way whatsoever.

"Feel like many people are over reacting about this game

The hungarian side played good football and had a very compact and well organized defence

Much like with Crotone and a few of our other draws, lots of unlucky moments, two posts being the bad luck in this game 

Match could have easily been 3-1,4-1 with more luck and then most people would be calling the team great again 

Pirlo's football is actually a huge step forward from what we've been seeing in the last 2-3 years 
The games are actually really exciting even if we don't win, there's continuos attempts to push forward, under allegri and sarri it was mostly a side way pass galore dry bore fest saved by individual talent 

Even if we don't win much this year, as a foundation i think great work is getting done. The only issue is that CR7 is still the player that makes the difference, when he leaves management needs to splurge on someone close to his level. Dybala is past it for us, Pirlo is doing good enough to earn at least another year past this season, and the Argentinian has no place in his type of football, sell sell sell, and try to replace, it's a win-win.

BUT that doesnt excuse all the bad he did yesterday: bad passes, got dispossessed and stopped the play when we had opportunity to penetrate.

"Well at least we won. Technically we can win the group (pretty sure it won't happen) but here are my thoughts after this game:

\- Danilo as CB is a no no. I mean everybody but De Ligt were injured so it's okay, but we should avoid that. He's far better on the left and at this point a lot better than Alex Sandro.

\- Yeah Alex Sandro was too slow the whole game. It's big problem if you consider that Cuadrado and him usually are the one running the wings up and down. Also, it's a problem that he is to slow in the defense after we attack. But he was injured and probably wouldn't have played if Danilo hadn't have to play in the Center. Sooo, he needs some time at this point.

\- Was it the best Arthur game with Juve so far? He was okay, sometimes he could pass the ball faster and maybe be more accurate. But he is improving, if he gets enough time, he might be the player we want him to be.

\- McKennie on the right a wrong decision (IMO). Sometimes he doesn't know where to go and is blocking one of our players (like dybala a few times). I see him more like a Matuidi kind of player, a player who recover the ball and stuff like that.

\-Berna wasn't bad, a big plus for me. A big thank you to Mancini who let him play and so he gained a bit of selfconfidence. Unluck with that post (with italy he hit a post too) but if continues to work hard and trying, he can be a good joker for us.

\-Dybala. It hurts me to see him perform that badly. He can't find space, he is slow and since Morata came, our game changed and that game doesn't fit well with Dybala. The only thing we can do is wait and hoping he finds last seasons pace. Come on joya!

\- Ronaldo and Morata are just incredible. Without them we could be totally lost this season. A big fuck you to my past self when I wasn't too happy that Morata came. Love you buddy. De Ligt should be our starter CB, that guy is a wall and plays like Chiello in his prime. And looks like a captain for me too.

\- Kulu and Chiesa didn't perform as expected. Okay Chiese was injured and doesn't have played much since the red card, same as Dybala here, he needs to find his pace but I'm sure that he will explode with Pirlo. 

\- At this point, I prefer Rabiot over Bentacur. I Don't know, this season he is another guy.

\- Last but not least, Pirlo. Yes I had excuses for the performance of the team in the first month of the season. The player had no real preparation, a lot on injuries and Corona. But a this point we need to see Pirlos game on the pitch. So far I just see a disorganized offense which is only dangerous if Cuadrado crosses the ball. Maybe we have to many players on the wings or maybe it's the lack of creativity, but it's strange to see how we struggle to score with that offense. Almost to none shots outside the box (well we have them but most of the time it's a 'just shot to ball or we lose the ball'. I don't see a plan or let's say a Pirlo-Ball. Our wings (Kulu, Berna Chiesa) our overrun by our fullbacks (more like overrun by Cuadrado) and often stand just next to them and have no real impact. Pirlo needs to find something for them. He also needs to improve our game from the center. If we are just difficult from the wings, big teams like bayern or liverpool will counter that easily. Everybody is shitting on our defense, that they doesn't look good, at this point we got the best defense in the league. The problem is that we don't score. The game we scored more than 2 goals, where the one, where the opponents made some individual mistakes.

If playing in a two man attack he's lost, if played between the mid and attack, he's lost again. Can't play on the wing either. Perhaps he can work in a 3 man attack... But this means sacrificing in other areas. 

It's a real shame and a big challenge for Pirlo. He needs to fit him in somehow or they will sell him for sure.

"Now that we won the game... Everyone saying something like “how can we win UCL when we struggle vs Ferencvaros” has lost the plot. 

1. Winning the UCL takes a very different skill set than beating a 100% parked ass team like this one. 
2. This Juve team is not good enough to win the UCL and you knew that before this game. 
3. This sub really needs to understand the Pirlo appointment + the signing of raw youngsters like Chiesa, Kulu, and Weston as basically a white flag on the mad dash for the champions league. This season is for building something more sustainable and that requires patience. Sucks for Ronaldo but the “all in on UCL while we have Ronaldo” formula was just not working. 


On the game more generally: Yes this game was not good like the Cagliari game but that tends to happen when you give up an early banter goal to a team that was prepared to defend 1 point to the death, let alone 3 points. McKennie’s free floating/whatever he’s doing role doesn’t work or at least doesn’t work with Dybala, who looks like someone that fits less and less on this team. I don’t wanna be too harsh on Sandro and Danilo for looking like they weren’t sure what to do bc that’s exactly what you expected from a Danilo-Sandro-De Ligt back line.

"i think ya'll are overreacting. 62% ball possession, 17 shots, 2 posts 2 super saves by their keeper, they scored 1 goal on a weak counter where our defender slipped. Aside from 2-3 counterattacks they didn't do any thing, when you play against these teams that put 11 players in the box and wait to strike on the counter its difficult to score for anyone, especially if you concede a bullshit goal early. You are susceptible to a counter attack when you're committing men forward to pin the opposition in their own trequarti (whats the english word for this? lol ) . Still with the chances we created this game could have easily ended 4/5 nothing and it would have been a fair scoreline. I am concerned about Dybala however, there are some off the ball movements i noticed that show he's completely out of sync with everything else happening on the pitch.

"I wish Bernardeschi wasn't subbed, I really hate these mass-subs we are doing every game, manager should take his time and only sub who needs to be subbed, Kulusuveski didn't had any meaningful impact, and I believe Dybala should have stayed. 

The only sub that should have happened as soon as possible (probably in half time) is Morata for McKenni, and i really don't wanna see McKenni in the wing ever again, it is just not for him. 

Imo, it should have been: 

Morata &lt;=&gt; McKenni 

then later on: 

Rabiot &lt;=&gt; Bentancur/Arthur 

And that's it, these two subs should have been enough to seal the game.",gdhtwfm,k0eph4,Juve,2020-11-25 07:00:56,alaslipknot,-2

Arthur a guarantee starter same goes for morata 
Dybala should start from bench until cr7 or morata lose form.

Rabiot over bentacur.

In my perfect world after what happened against Lazio dybala scored there with berna assist.

Its sharp, fast, and he makes runs and plays with effort and its helping CR7 so much. Also, thought Dybala was pretty good, looked in much better shape. Still think he drops too deep but he was good overall. The Pirlo era looks promising. Much quicker and more athletic style of play. Arthur fantastic also.",gd47b12,jyj5py,Juve,2020-11-22 05:47:34,Walmartsavings2,56

I have given up all hope on Berna and then he goes and plays really well. For fucks sake please regain confidence and play like this!!!!!!!!

Only complaint I suppose is that we didn't finish more chances, we should've been up at least 4 goals. 

Thank fuck De Ligt is back, looks like he never missed a game. Reliable and solid as fuck (as always). Him and De Ligt as i said in the match thread will be the best defensive duo in the world soon.

"Overall a really solid performance. We controlled the game for large portions, if we can keep doing that consistently this team can do wonders. I really liked how we looked with the 4 at the back as opposed to the 3 at the back. I’d like to see more of that going forward, especially with the injuries to our center backs. Everyone pulled their weight, but I think Arthur stood out for his ball retention and even his tackles. He and Rabiot are forming a nice duo. Bernardeschi impressed me and I truly hope we see more of this Berna; we all know he’s got the talent he just never seems to show it, but tonight we saw glimpses. And it’s soooo good to have De Ligt back. He barely put a foot wrong the entire game and we looked more solid defensively than we have pretty much all season. Overall, I like what I’m seeing and I hope we continue to put in performances like these.",gd493sw,jyj5py,Juve,2020-11-22 06:01:51,Medoxi,8

Pirlo seem to know how to manage players , some went from being disaster on the field to great squad players ( Danilo for example ) 
But , when he sub on players I don't see the subs changing the game so far 

I gave up on berna , but today was a good effort from him

This team still hasn't synchronized yet , a lot of passes to place where they think a player is at or going to
If they have an understanding between them , it's going to rain goals",gd4boaq,jyj5py,Juve,2020-11-22 06:22:21,forzaq8,9

"Great overall performance. As someone else said, a few dull moments, but I didn't mind them as they only contributed to our control of the game. Arthur and Rabiot bossed the fuck out of the midfield. Berna played pretty well so I hope he can keep it up after his pretty awful spell with us. Really nice to have De Ligt and Sandro back too. Some wasted chances in the second half, that was a little frustrating, but the fact that we even made those chances is a good sign going forward.

"This was a good game. I have been watching a few players closely, and I’m happy with their progress. Just have to keep it going and finish more of our chances. 

Arthur and Rabiot midfield has a lot of potential. Cuadrado honestly looked fantastic out there (and as captain today, no less), but I still worry sometimes that too much of the play goes through him and relies on his crossing from the right. Kulu looked dangerous in the first half. Morata unfortunately offside to cancel a nice Berna goal (??).

"great performance by everyone but unless some tactics or kulu's position changes, dybala and kulu can't play together which is really annoying. Kulu was fantastic all game until dybala came on and then he..practically vanished. I really like the ronaldo kulu chemistry and want dybala and kulu in the same lineup but idk man dybala just kept on coming to where kulu was playing all game today. Except with dybala on the ball in the right hand side and kulu also there, there was a void in cf as ronaldo played a true lw today. That void was filled by mckennie a couple of times today which is not good. I hope pirlo solves this confusion. Yes dybala was a little better than his previous games but he still lost some easy possession through unnecessary dribbles but that's not what's bugging me cause he is just going through some bad form but this confusion between him and kulu and dybala coming in kulu's space where there is clearly a void in cf position is frustrating to me",gd4a0j9,jyj5py,Juve,2020-11-22 06:10:03,nigamantuturu,8

"Sometimes a player doesn’t fit at a club, it’s one of the things about football subs on Reddit that drives me mad, I do it as well, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are bad players. Look at Lukaku at Man U for example. 

I think the thing with Berna is he’s not a system player, he thrives when the ball is moving quickly and he can be a choatic player on the pitch moving the ball up quickly and making unexpected plays during periods of transition. But that has never been Juve’s way we have had managers who want their players to stand on very specific parts of the pitch and in general ‘following orders” is kind of in our DNA. So often you see Berna start a slightly mad run but at the end of it looks up and no one has gone with him (because they’re all doing what they’re supposed to) so he does a stupid back pass or poor cross field ball. 

Berna has been POOR for us now for a while, there is no doubt, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he looks back to his old self when he manages to find a new club who is just a better fit for him. I’m not surprised the NT is a good fit for him. It has lots of unpredictable, young and quick attacking players, and I can see why that compliments his style of play better than Juve does",gchghxu,juw7ag,Juve,2020-11-16 18:53:28,downfallndirtydeeds,6

Ronaldo is a football monument and a prestigious player for the game ... I am a real Madrid fan look where my team is and look at man u aswell losing him to buy other players ok fine that's good but he is CR7 he carries all the teams he plays for losing him would mean all too much especially when you have an inexperienced manager (doing quite well tho) he may struggle to find other ways of winning as he doesn't have a decent strike force (morata + ? ).

"Unpopular Opinion: I really won't be sad if he leaves because unfortunately since he came we stopped playing like a team and instead we focused on making him happy and the players play for him... etc. And that's something Juve never done to any player, which resulted to us playing ugly. Started in Allegri's last season, then we blamed it on him and signed attacking football coach (Sarri) which backfired and we start to get worse. Now we gambled with inexperienced coach for him (thinking he will do the same as Zadine). As much as I hate to say it, but Ronaldo and Juve don't fit each other.

Therefore, him leaving will make us play even more as a team, and the players don't feel pressured to give the ball to him. I know some of you will say ""He is the one who's saving us, we play shit without him...etc"" yeah because the players forgot how to play like a team, they became dependent on CR7. Also, we will get rid of his salary, and invest to young players like Locatilli, De Paul, Aouar... etc. Juve now in reconstruction period, so I doubt that we will win the CL any time soon.",gbwmw26,js0xq7,Juve,2020-11-11 12:41:08,Alucard_HSU,-18

"Overall good game. Yes you can go if this player did that or if the defense was 100% great the entire time or if pirlo subbed this or that earlier or whatever but come on guys! Just enough this match was entirely lost due to dybala everyone else as a whole had a decent game and decent coaching by pirlo. Dybala was shit as a player idk how many times he lost the ball or fell over like a little boy, like he has been since forever even when has been great before he can never have the strength to battle through midfield and go up. 

Its not hate, its not about wanting the guy out. Our number 1 problem right now is Dybala. Simple as that, when you have a guy who is so good, franchise player etc instead of helping you, remember after ronaldo he is on paper the best we got and he believes he is as good as ronaldo or messi. He needs to be better.

Now, there are a few players that some people defende for a few seasons too long while some of us see it a couple seasons earlier (Rugani) that are just not working. I dont hate dybala but honestly? I said this past 2 seasons too, if lukaku plus cash i would have taken it, if 2 of real madrid players like asencio isco? I would have taken it and these deals were possible at some point. If over 100m i would have taken it. The guy doesn’t work under any coach, he isn’t really a center forward he isnt really a winger he isnt really an attacking mid and sure as fuck cant play deeper in midfield.

I think the tendency to slow down and stop playing after scoring 1-0 is pretty much ingrained in the team's DNA at this point, it happens no matter who the manager is.

"The most balanced opinion I can give:

Dybala is a luxury player and because of this he only ever does well when the entire team is fully synched and they can allow him to move freely and express his creativity.

However, in a team that is yet to still find its optimal chemistry and also a team that heavily relies on a collective effort to press, pass, cover positions, respect position etc. Dybala does terribly.

The player is also coming form injury and COVID, so essentially we're not looking at a player at the peak of his form. However, he's always been inconsistent and way too often the fanbase ignores this after he pulls out some world class magic goal or play.

Long story short, he has some world class, elite player traits but these are not expressed in a consistent manner. The handicaps in the other departments (pressing, interception, physical strenght, aggressiveness) unfortunately often make him a liability.

In the current Pirlo tenure, the most efficient use of Dybala is using him as a super sub or start games and get subbed halfway through. A game of football involves a variety of different strategies that alternate and unfortunately from him, he's only compatible with some of them.

Wage wise, the player is not worth 15m a season. Like many others have mentioned in other threads, the player has dissapeared in many many big games, and the salary involved, especially in the middle of this pandemic, makes ZERO sense. To be brutally honest, Juve selling him might actually be a win-win for both parties if relationships sour because of wage talks.",gaszh8f,jm50ck,Juve,2020-11-02 00:34:27,Kapacaraba,59

"Hard to tell. Weve played three different styles of football in the past three years. Dybala clear fit in awesome last year, and is capable of a lot. He needs a lot build around him though.

It seems like every year people question if he should stay. Last season he was our best player, he needs time to get his fitness back.",gatcl2d,jm50ck,Juve,2020-11-02 02:28:12,juveinterview,6
"In truth it’s a bit early to make long term assertions of him, both in terms of his Juventus future and his place in Pirlo’s system. He had Covid, he’s not fully fit and he’s certainly rusty, as well as his form partly being linked to Juves. 

But I have my worries. At his very best, he is a world class player and potentially one of the best players in the world. But we’ve not seen that for a long time. He had strong moments last season, but it still didn’t match the heights of 2017-2019. 

Overarchingly, he has physical and positional drawbacks. It’s still not clear where he plays best, and despite various managers trying various tactics, he still seems to play this pseudo 10-second striker role. He passes backwards most of the time, he doesn’t cross that much and he doesn’t run into channels. This is partly because he’s always very tightly marked, but it might (disappointingly) be due to his work ethic and attitude. 

Pirlo wants his team to press, and win back the ball ‘as quickly as possible’. It’s been said many times, but if you play Dybala and Ronaldo in a front three, you only have one forward instigating the pressing. I think the best chance of him prospering is him playing in a two upfront with Ronaldo or Morata, with Kulu and Chiesa doing the dirty work on the flanks. The other potential system is in a 4-3-1-2 (or 3-4-1-2) where he sits behind the strikers, and plays as a raw 10. He’s never going to play LW, and he’s repeatedly shown his inefficacy at RW. He’s not been great as a false 9 either. It’s either second striker or 10.

I don’t know what’s going on with his contract situation, and his general relationship with the club, but it seems he’s not on great terms with Paratici, and who knows who else. Fundamentally, for the contract he’s demanding, he has to either show it on the pitch or the club have to take a gamble and show faith in him.

I see his future settled one of two ways. He impresses this season and either stays (with a new contract) or gets sold for a big fee. Or he has a lacklustre season and gets sold. So, despite him being my favourite player, I think there’s a significant chance he leaves.",gaszzus,jm50ck,Juve,2020-11-02 00:39:11,Lord_Maul,10

"He's being this sub's scapegoat of a severely underperforming team. Did you watch the match vs Barcelona? What did you make of Kulu's and Chiesa's performance, two players that supposedly aren't suffering from fitness issues? Kulu was just as slow, struggled to string passes between the frontline. Chiesa was invisible the whole time he was in. Yet people seem to focus their critics on a player who hasn't played for months, who's only been training with the team for a couple of weeks, who clearly wasn't even supposed to start but had to because of injuries/covid (ronaldo and ramsey out). The thing is, this team's main issue still lies in the midfield and their inability to move the ball forward which was clear in the match vs barca. If you look up statistics, you will see that our midfield's favourite target for passes is danilo. IIRC even one of the italian papers wrote about this (was it gazetta? can't recall). Until we can work out our midfield issues I think our forwards will keep underperforming and dybala will keep dropping deep to try and get the ball forward.  


Even if you think these aren't valid points, don't you think dybala has, at least, earned the benefit of the doubt for past performances?  


If you think he's done at the club, do you expect to sell him? Do you really think there are better options on the market? I don't.  


Oh and don't let today's scoreline fool you, we ended 4-1 but we only had 7 attempts total with 4 shots on target vs Spezia. We should be able to win these kinds of matches more comfortably and you can't just shove all the blame onto Dybala. Focusing too much on a single player is just small club mentality. We should focus more on the team as a whole because we just can't keep trading players/changing coaches and expect team chemistry to just come out of nowhere.

"Some thoughts:

Having Ronaldo back gives us time to slowly improve everything else, while maintaining decent results. He makes players around him better, takes up a lot of attention and space. 

Frustrating to watch Dybala and Bentancur, two of our best last season, be complete deadweight. 

The midfield 3 can work if it’s Rabiot-Arthur-McKennie. Bring on Ramsey if we need a goal. 

Overall, there are lots of things to improve on but having Ronaldo back shows the fine line between “Juve look lost” and “Juve win 4-1.” Just takes a little bit of onside finishing. There’s obviously something about Pirlo’s system that is working, and a lot that isn’t working. This is to be expected with a new coach. As long as the results are there for now (at least against teams like Spezia, Crotone, etc.) we can live with everything else not being super fluid and slick right away.",gasxvnr,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 00:20:01,jct1121,61

"Ronaldo did well of course, but I think taking off Dybala was a bigger positive change than bringing on Ronaldo.

The problem with Dybala right now is that it seems like he's supposed to be the link between midfield and attack, but he is simply too slow to cover the big space between the opposing team's midfield and defence, and ends up jogging out of position (often way too far out to the right or too far into Juve's half) and is then nowhere to be seen when it's time to build an attack through the center of the pitch. It's especially bad when facing a team that likes to press high and defend agressively (like Spezia today), because Dybala dawdles and dwells on the ball and loses it way too easily when he finally gets it.

Morata as a result becomes completely isolated in attacks that build from the center, and pretty much never gets the ball unless it's he himself who starts the attack at the midfield so that Dybala is bypassed.

When Dybala is subbed off and a more offensively minded midfielder like Rabiot or Ramsey comes on, all these issues are resolved and the whole team just looks better.

I have always liked Dybala, but at the moment I just don't see how he is supposed to fit in the team. I'm not sure if it's just that he's lacking in fitness, or if he just doesn't give a shit.

On a more positive note, I think Morata has been truly excellent this season, and if he has a bit more luck with the offside calls, he's going to bag a shitload of goals. I think it was noticeable that the attack looked worse when he was subbed off. Kulusevski has some of the same issues as Dybala, where he runs around too freely and ends up out of position.

McKennie also made a good impression, looked very dynamic and created a lot going forward.",gasw5e6,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 00:04:07,Krankelibrankelfnatt,41
"Wow morata has been an absolute animal for us. His hold up and linking game is amazing. 

McKennie was great and so was chiesa. 

On a side not, I'm sorry for using this language but the announcers for espn on this game are fucking retarted. They spent 20 minutes after the first goal explaining to us that they don't understand the offside rule. 

How the fuck so you have a job and not know that. I would rather listen to monkeys with cow bells than these two clowns again. It was so irritating

Other than that very good game to work on tactics and confidence",gau1ofc,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 05:50:25,WhyAlwaysMe1991,9

"As much as I would like to praise Ronaldo, Man, Danilo has transformed into a beast in opposition line breaking passes. Rabiot definitely cementing his place as an solid midfield starter. I always hated Cuadrado for the past 2 seasons, but this season he's been entertaining enough to watch..

"I can understand that Dybala is underperforming at the moment because of the injury and illness, but damn it I can't understand or justify his attitude and overall body language. 

After Rabiot's goal (which was beautiful IMO) the camera closes in on Dybala and he's fuming. Okay, you aren't on top of your game right now and surely can't be happy about it, but  your teammate has scored a goal and basically won you the game. At least show some respect/comeradeship/good sportsmanship and don't behave like a child when something like happens. How hard can it be to smile for 2 minutes?

Really can't understand what is happening inside of his head, but if this continues alongside with bad performances on the pitch then he'll push himself out of the team.",gasywe6,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 00:29:14,grdivrag,20

"Maybe I am the only one but I'm hugely surprised by Morata's pace

He is really fast. What's his top speed?

Rabiot's goal was amazing but I'd like to see more goals coming from mids because that's gonna be a huge boost in confidence for the midfielders and greatly improve juve's attacking threat

Chiesa finally picked up with that wonderful long ball to rabiot's which he turned into a goal

Morata is wonderful on and off the ball

Cristiano.... If you're looking for something negative about this man, get some help

Ramsey is gonna be great in mckennie's position but with more attacking mindset, once he's back to full fitness",gavf53o,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 13:56:40,GraphicsMonster,3

"We still have ton of deficiencies, especially defensively, especially when other teams press us.

BUT, I like our speed in attack. It's still a bit chaotic but I feel like Pirlo has an idea about how he wants us to win and the players get it. Totally opposed to how it felt under Sarri, when players would just pass the ball aimlessly around the box and wait for something to happen. I don't expect us to keep on winning like this, and we will be dropping lots of points this season. But if we keep improving I'm fine with that. I'd even be fine if we don't win anything this season.",gate30g,jm4neg,Juve,2020-11-02 02:40:15,WW_Jones,2
"Its clear the team looks way more balanced in a 3-5-2 as oppose to a 3-4-3. I think Pirlo should look at integrating Kulu in the Right CM position and allowing him to break through the lines and make runs from deep (whilst allowing him to come off the flank to cut inside)

Best team for us right now IMO is:

Demirl-Bonucci-Danilo

Cuadardo-Kulu-Arthur-Rabiot-Chiesa

Ronaldo-Morata

He's better suited only playing the Coppa Italia.

Now for bonucci, how long is he gonna keep playing as a starter? How many mistakes will it take for us to realise that this guy is done? i see no veterancy in his way of dedending and he always be making panicky decisions and rookie mistakes.

"Rodrigo de paul is exactly what we need to fix our midfield rn. He has the most dribbles and big chance created in league and offers decent contribution to the defensive phase as well. A ramsey kind of player (ramsey is good but unreliable). 

Just in case if we are getting another striker , i do think that bernadeschi would be more important to the team than dybala. Giroud would be a great one tho. He's passionate and kind of a player who doesn't seek for limelight.

We do need a LB. sandro is such a riskfree player. We need someone who can offer to the attacking phase .

Memphis depay can be a good backup or can even start in the wings if he does well. If he's available for 5mil , we should definitely get him. Resting ronaldp against relagation teams had a huge role in Madrid's 3 ucl peat. Gotta keep him fresh",ggyisr8,kjr8h8,Juve,2020-12-25 11:26:52,maestroPirlo,22
"There's been a lot of interesting names linked to Juve already (from what I've seen: Pogba, Reynolds, Milik, Depay, De Paul, Alaba, along with Aouar rumors persisting). I don't expect any huge signings due to obvious financial factors but locking down Reynolds as an heir to Cuadrado's position would be a positive move, alongside another forward  (not sure if it'll be a name as exciting as Milik or Depay but anything is better than nothing) for depth.

Aside from that I think it's just important to make use of the time available and start to make headway for whatever major deals that management has planned in the summer. Personally hoping for Aouar still but we'll see what happens.",ggzfzls,kjr8h8,Juve,2020-12-25 20:36:53,firewalkwithme-,11

Now that I'm off my soap box, I'd like to see a rotational striker. Without Morata or when he's just off, the team looks lost. I'd also maybe say another midfielder, but I think who we have has shown promise and with the red cards, injuries zero pre season for Pirlo, I think this team still needs time to find their identity.

With Chiellini and Bonucci pushing into their mid 30s and Dragusin’s lack of experience we need to consider 2-3 centre backs.

"Here are the hot takes. 

Cuadrado with a stupid, dangerous, late challenge. Embarrassing. 

Bonucci with the most brain dead performance I have ever seen, especiallyin the 1st half. He was beaten almost every time with ease. That 2nd goal and 3rd goal were shocking, errors from him all throughout the game. Seriously proving he's the most overrated defender in the world. 

I thought Pirlos subs made a difference. Danilo was very strong and we were much better in midfield in the 2nd half. 

Challenge from Castrovilli on Ronaldo was definitely a penalty, Valero could've been sent off, the challenge from Dragowski on Berna was also poor and late.

We played like shit, Fiorentina played like shit, they got an early goal, we gradually collapsed after the red card, and the ref did everything in his power to give Fiorentina the win. Pirlo's subs were stupid, and there were dumb individual mistakes (but tbh, these were probably a result of fatigue more than anything else). I also think the Napoli decision fucked us up and I can't blame the players for that if that's the case.

I think we'll bounce back. I don't think this is indicative of the rest of the season. As for our title hopes... I'm not sure. But we've got big games coming up, and if we win them, I say we've still got a shot. Plus, I wouldn't be surprised to see Milan, Inter, etc. crumble under the pressure like usual as well.

"2020 has definitely been the worst year for Juve since like 2013. That year had the surprisingly painful 4-0 on aggregate vs Bayern, and then the group stage meltdown of 13-14. Id kill to have that team playing in our new style. 

Pretty sure I’ve said this before here but I’ll say it again, Pirlo is my favorite player ever and I will happily defend him til the end of time. I got all the caveats ready, Ronaldo’s missed time, De Ligt wasn’t here for most of the season, no pre-season, Pirlo is new, I got em all. With all that said, a 3-0 loss vs Fiorentina at home just doesn’t cut it for Juventus EVER. We’re 7 points back and we’ve yet to play Milan, Inter, or Napoli. The honeymoon phase really is over now, after those 3 games there will be nowhere left to hide. 

Still, I’m happy with some of the progress we’ve made. I think this is a transitional year for this team as the Ronaldo contract winds down and the last of the “old guard” retires. We’re trying to build something beyond those players, with youngsters on the field and a coach that plays a modern style of football. Even if Pirlo’s not the long term solution, he’s actually getting the team to commit to a more attacking pressing style. That’s gonna be crucial if we want to bring in another coach that plays a similar style. I don’t think Juve absolutely NEED to win a trophy this season, but we need to compete and it goes without saying a top 4 finish is an absolute necessity. 

This team has seen better days, but there’s still a lot to look forward to.

"Bentancur and Sandro should not be starters anymore, am so tired of players who perform good for one game and then fuck up the next 5.

&amp;nbsp;

Also it's time to give Bernardeschi another chance, he was super unlucky last year, but he has such a good mentality, specially when we are losing.

&amp;nbsp;

Dybala, he should be subbed in from the 65th minutes every game, not be given 5 minutes at the end of each game, if not,  just sell the guy.

&amp;nbsp;

Today's mistake were 100% on Pirlo, the sudden counter-attack goal happened more than once this season. 

Danilo for Ramsey also was a mistake, he should've asked Chiesa to fill in until he got a better reading for the game. 

&amp;nbsp;

And finally, this is the kind of games where having a coach like Allegri or Mourinho is a huge plus, Allegri would have just played defensively the entire game and find a way to score 2 goals on a counter or in set piece, this is also where players like Dybala are keys, cause all you need is one chance and he can put the perfect shot (i can remind you of many games where he did just that in situations just like this under Allegri)

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, 

This isn't the end of the world, losing 6 points at one day surely sucks, but we didn't win the title 9 years in a row by crying and complaining. 

&amp;nbsp;

You read it here first, both Inter and Milan will lose it against us, and they will fuck up around March~April as they always do, they don't have our bench, nor our spirit, this is Juventus, if we managed to win last year with that clusterfuck situation with Sarri, we will also do it this year.

Bonucci was more than god awful today. I won’t go into that more. Sandro has been the same as the past two years. 1-2 decent performances and back to his bad form. 

De Ligt was the only defender who looked like a defender today. I know I even said Fiorentina is dangerous but they weren’t good today, we were just too bad.

"We conceded the 1st goal on a counterattack because our high-attacking style of play all too often leaves a hole between the attacking players and our defensive line, which Fiorentina exploited with the pass to Ribéry who had time to pick out a penetrating through ball to their striker who had a good finish. Although Szczesny made a big misjudgment in how and when he charged out, the fact that our back line was so flat allowed for Ribéry's through pass to be all the more devastating. 

We can all agree Cuadrado made a horrible decision with that challenge. He could have broken the other player's leg! Absolutely zero need to go in like that after losing the ball in the opponent's penalty box when there was no real risk of a counter. That red card really did cripple us for the rest of the game. 

I actually think we did so-so given that we were down a man. Ronaldo and Chiesa created several chances and although I hate pulling a Mourinho and bitching about the ref, the inconsistency with the VAR was more than annoying. They had little to no hesitation to check VAR for Cuadrado's challenge (which I agree was a red), but they did not even check when Ronaldo got pushed from behind in the box, for Bernardeschi getting clearly pulled down in the box towards the end of the game, and that handball on Ronaldo's freekick in the first half. Also, Valero not getting a 2nd yellow for his foul in the 2nd half was more than a little controversial. 

I think if those calls went our way, it would have been a totally different outcome even though we were in 10 men. Also, Bonucci was so sketch. His poor decisions led to their 2nd goal and one of their clearcut chances in the first half which against Champions League-level competition would have been an easy goal. 

Anyway, it's a tough loss and it sucks that our undefeated league run is over, but I don't think it's symptomatic of fundamental flaws with our team although we could find better ways to defend counterattacks when we lose the ball while attacking or in the midfield.",ggqiuvn,kieure,Juve,2020-12-23 06:19:11,oldblue2021,1

Cuadrado gets a red card in the 18th minute and that’s game folks. Stop blaming anyone on this besides him. After he got sent off they still controlled total possession time and had some balls to try and compete to the end which shows they got heart and respect the coach. Wipe this game away and pray De Ligt is okay.,ggqfmxb,kicl8z,Juve,2020-12-23 05:52:50,Butch9x,10
The ref had a shit game today. Cuadrado's red was deserved but that always should have been a 2nd yellow.. He challenged from behind not even going for the ball and the ref literally was reaching for the red in his pocket and stopped. Like what? I really hope this break is what the players need to get them back into the groove. Hopefully De Ligt isn't injured and hopefully we can get a good signing in January. It's just the little things. Players take shots when they should pass and then also pass when they should take shots.

Pirlo himself is part of a rebuilding project, with a bunch of young players he’s managing to get results from. At the start of last year, fivethirtyeight rated our team as the best. This year, inter started with a better rating. Journalists also generally rated Inter’s team as better than ours.

Atm, our GF:GA ratio under Pirlo has been better so far (2.4 vs. 1.77).

GA per game under Pirlo has been better so far (.83 vs. 1.13).

GF per game has been the same so far (2 vs. 2)

We don't squeak by as effectively as we did under Sarri, but our defense has improved dramatically (approximately 35% more effective with pretty much the same defensive roster). Our attack should have improved dramatically but it has not. This is because much like last year, our midfield has yet to gel with attack on consistent basis.

Having said that, I think Pirlo will be better with us than Sarri, but Sarri was critiziced so harshly here for reasons I still don't understand. It is an achievement having won the serie A. 

The fault relied with the management. You bring a guy that needs time to build like he did at Napoli but a year before you brought CR7 who needs to win the Champions ASAP.

Some people said Sarri's style didn't fit with Juventus, and maybe is true, but why the fuck bring him in the first place?

"* Juventus and the opponent's GK turning into a demigod, name a more iconic duo.
* This is one of the only times that I've actually thought that Ronaldo put in a really poor performance. He was nowhere to be seen, and when he did get the ball he didn't really accomplish anything. Everything just went wrong.
* Morata was also unusually poor, it almost looked like he wanted too much and ended up unconcentrated and made lots of errors.
* Atalanta really should have had a player sent off, if not for the studs-up straight legged ankle breaker on Cuadrado, then for the constant nasty fouls that constantly messed up the flow of the game.

"We created enough chances to win the game but didn’t take them. Pirlo should have made more subs and earlier though because the second half got rough at points. This game was crying out for Aaron Ramsey. Still, I think Gollini was MOTM and that says something about how many goals we should’ve scored.  

Ronaldo played really poorly and I think the idea that he’s playing “out of position” is grasping at straws. Our basic setup has not changed all season and neither has Ronaldo’s position in it. It’s gotten tweaked here and there but the basic shape is the same and Ronaldo plays literally wherever he wants in it. There’s no bigger picture positional crisis there, he just had a bad game and that happens. It’s not like a dip in form in this part of the season is unusual for him. He’ll do better. 

If Arthur is out for a significant period of time, Rabiot/Bentancur should play next to McKennie and play either Ramsey or Kulu (unless one of the strikers is Dybala) behind the strikers, McKennie is good but that position is not his best.",gg29luh,kefzdy,Juve,2020-12-17 03:42:43,jct1121,4

two great saves, goal looked kind of dodgy I guess

De Ligt 8
Really a rock in defense, Zapata looked like a schoolboy

Bonucci 7
That tackle denying Zapta the run on goal is worth these points alone

Danilo 6

Plays his game, had a good shot at the end but dangerously lost posession once in front of our own goal. Didn't give much impact going forward either

Cuadrado 5

Very bad in the first half, a bit better in the second one, his crosses prevented him from being rated even lower

Bentancur 5,5

Pretty invisible, wins tackles but nothing going forward from him

Rabiot 6

Played better than Bentancur, but didn't have that urgency going forward either. Lost too many tackles as well today

Chiesa ?

Invisible, but scored a wonder goal and got us the penalty. Don't really know what to rate him

McKennie 7

Very good link up if he doesnt have to think too much, as soon as he has the ball for more than 3 seconds you know you are going to lose posession though. His grinta nearly makes up for it, had some great tackles and passes today.

Morata 4,5

Somehow the most active player on the pitch, but nothing went like it should today, could have had at least 3 goals. Also got a dumb yellow again

Ronaldo 3,5

Had one good action in the whole game when he made a great backheel pass. Invisible otherwise and that penalty was criminal for his standards

Glad Dybala got the goal so the hype can build up some more so we can sell him next transfer window. Maybe a Pogba trade?

"This is what separates him and Messi for me, high stakes game, on one of the biggest stages, and a must win game he is that player that can deliver when needed. He’s a guy the team can turn to in a time of need and he can bring the team what it needs to succeed. 

Yes it’s just the group stage and we both had guaranteed qualification but with this win, a 3-0 one especially we’re at the top of the group and avoid other top teams for the first round of the knockout stage.

Edit: I did not mean to infer that this game alone is the only reason, but a culmination of these types of games are the reason why Ronaldo is the better player to me as when the pressure is on, he rises to the occasion instead cracking under the pressure

I’m not oblivious to the fact that individually Messi had a better game than Ronaldo. But every attack ran through Messi and while that’s great since he is one of the best ever, but it’s predictable and defendable. Part of it is also because he doesn’t have the likes of xavi, iniesta, prime busquets, Neymar and Suarez. It’s safe to say Ronaldo elevates his team and Messi needs a good team to be elevated to that level",gf5hr6z,k9mgk9,Juve,2020-12-09 17:11:01,luker941,43

"Ok. I had to comment on this because the other day a mod 🔒 a comment thread between us.

First of all, we are mixing TWO different things when mentioning Piguain and Mc*something*. Calling someone pig for their physical appearance is not racist it's being a douche. We have seen the same thing with Eden Hazard. Similar situation in which RM fans say in different social media to go eat more hamburgers and so on. 

As for McKennie situation as I said, it's ""racist"" because you wanted it to be racist. How and why is relating Mc*something* with a player name racist? If anything the product it's called Chicken McNuggets not just Mc*something*. 

As for bans before announcing it is a little bit unfair and I think all of us are mature enough to understand not to say it based on a constructive criticism by the mods not just because *""we think it is racist therefore we will ban anyone who refers to that player in that way*. 

Let's be more self-critical, he [McKennie] deserves our respect but don't try build/connect a bridge where can't be built.

Objectively, that nickname, especially in a context which explains it, is not racist at all. It doesn't negatively judge on colour, religion, ethnicity or nationality and doesn't at all sound malicious. All those things are of course horrid, and real racism is abhorrent.

Let's be clear, it's not an indictment on you or anyone using the nickname. Im fully aware the intent is not racial.

"I 100% back the mods on this one. 

Whether or not those using the term meant it any racial way (and I am sure 99.9% did not), the ""fried chicken"" trope has significant racial connotations in American media. That is enough for me to consider the nickname as, at best, just really uncomfortable, but at worst, racist, and I totally support it being banned outright in this sub.

If Weston himself comes out and uses it, or says he is happy with it, then it would be fine - but until that happens I think it is safer to just avoid it.",gf3toay,k9edil,Juve,2020-12-09 07:09:43,moonshadow50,0

Motm for me was a tie of buffon or McKennie. McKennie has such great vision, passing ability, and the lungs of a fuckin wild stallion. He ran for 93 minutes against barca. Absolutely amazing.

"Lots of room for improvement still, Barca's shoddy defending helped us out a bit tonight but overall we are definitely the better team (key word: team). 

Still don't like the fact that we defend so deep and just let the opponent have the ball at times, but at least our defending is looking sharper and sharper most probably because we have Matthijs back and the kid is just a damn beast. 

McKennie is quickly becoming my new favorite player, he just needs to really get down the timing of tackles and his positioning and understanding with teammates, but that will probably come with time. 

Cuadrado is just amazing, love this dude. He's my MotM. 

Ronaldo as lethal as ever, his experience really brings a lot to the team.

Don't understand giving Dybala just 5mins or subbing off Ronaldo when he's on a hattrick with 2-3mins to go. He looked a bit unpleased with that, I hope he can look past that. 

Overall, this is another huge win after the comeback against Toro and is sure to give everyone in the team a massive confidence boost. Congratulations to Pirlo and the squad.",gf3nsb3,k9dz20,Juve,2020-12-09 06:20:21,rndmlgnd,21

Really liked that everyone was focused, goal efficiency at its finest. Legendary Buffon, CR7 phenomenal as ever. De Ligt, Bonucci and Danilo real solid in defense. Ramsey, Cuadrado &amp; Arthur did a great job in the midfield and please do us a favor and buy McKennie already. 

I was expecting Morata to score, but it's alright, he has more chances in the round of 16. Besides, he's already top scorer currently. 

I hope to see more of this Juve in the future, we are definitely on our way to become one of the best teams. Forza Juve!",gf3of0b,k9bkqs,Juve,2020-12-09 06:25:33,ablessedbandito,27

"We might have won but this is definitely one of our worst games so far this season. These are the conclusions I made after watching the game.

1- It seems like we play better as a team when we play with CAM. Granted that Ronaldo and Dybala didn't play well, but no one else had a good performance either.

2- Bentancur was awful today, his positioning was off and his passes were awful. 

3- Biggest issue today was the left side. Danilo and Chiesa are both having a great season but they really underperform when they are slotted on the left side. Issue is even Kulu underperforms when he is played on the left side so hopefully we can get a LM that can threaten the opposition and link well with CR7. 

4- Chiesa is playing well but his decision making is a bit slow. He is always a second too late when it comes to making a decision and that has been very noticable this game. However I do believe that it is common among young players and hopefully he can work on it.

5- we should have been awarded a penalty and I have no clue how the refs sitting in VAR missed it.

6- we need to get better at crossing the ball and playing through passes.

"1. Totally sold on De Ligt playing as the Central CB going forward. He can help defend both flanks, he is able to contribute a lot more offensively in this position, and he can control the backline better. As soon as he went back to this position in the second half, you could tell the difference.
2. Demiral isn't 100% fully recovered yet, but the good news is that he can play in his natural RCB position.
3. Bonucci needs to go back to being a LCB. He has the experience to do it, and he should be the one that makes the sacrifice. He can still play the ball from this position.
4. Chiesa great energy and a deserved goal.

"Let's give some credit to Demiral also. He played a really clean game. Was confident on the ball and looked up for passes. Really liked this performance from him.

De Ligt brings an aura of confidence in our defense which has been somewhat lacking lately (Chiello struggling with match fitness and injuries and Bonucci being Bonucci at times - we expect him to be the leader of the team but often times does not make the mark unfortunately)

Bernardeschi can work as a sub going forward, giving Chiesa/Ramsey a rest. I feel Kulu feels big pressure on his shoulders, he just needs time to be allowed to play and develop his football.

"Shocking. Player being paid 25% of club's annual budget is important to success. Pirlo is building the tactics to revolve around him and when he isnt there, it has a big effect. Juve doesn't have a substitute for him either, lets be honest he's pretty impossible to replace on the field. 

So lets just hope Ronaldo is going to be available for all the important games this season for one. Because it looks like we are all in on him. For two, lets hope the rest of the squad can figure out a way to turn up when he isn't there. Because we will **not** win the scudetto if we continue as is.",ge6f02t,k40o3e,Juve,2020-12-01 03:27:49,juventinn1897,10

"I really don't think not having Ronaldo is the problem. Morata has shown he's perfectly able to finish off attacks, I think our problem lies in not creating enough chances (especially through the middle) and not being able to press an opponent on their side of the pitch well enough. Sides like Benevento, Cagliari etc should not have that much time on the ball against us. We're defending too deep. 

All that being said, we also paid the price for having an out of form Dybala who just hasn't shown up in recent games and missed a sitter against Benevento which could've taken the match in a different direction as it was supposed to be 0-2 had he scored that. It's really not just Ronaldo and we'll be fine once he leaves, his impact (technique and tactics wise) isn't that great. His mentality however, is a different story and it's something we're obviously lacking without Buffon, Chiellini and Bonucci along those two.",ge7g9m7,k40o3e,Juve,2020-12-01 08:11:32,rndmlgnd,-2

My ratings:

Kulusevski: 8/10. Exceptional control of the ball and force going forward. 1 goal and an assist.  
Morata: 7/10. Great at holding the ball, and score a good penalty.  
Ramsey: 6/10. Didn't do too much worth noting.  
Rabiot: 7/10. Great performance. Won the penalty. Needs to dribble and take shots more often going forward. It's all about confidence.  
Fagioli: 7.5/10. Great game, high work rate between his passing and defending.  
Bernardeschi: 6/10. Didn't do too much worth noting.  
Frabotta: 7/10. Scored a goal, had good crosses.  
De Ligt: 7/10. Great technical skill between dribbling and passing, but didn't have too much defending to do. Needed to be the central CB in that back 3 not LCB.  
Demiral: 6.5/10. Great defending in the first half, not so great at handling the ball. I just don't think it's fair to have him as the central CB.  
Dragusin: 6/10. He was good at playing the ball. Made some defensive mistakes.  
Buffon: 6.5/10. Great leadership but didn't have much to do.",gl07otw,l6f2o9,Juve,2021-01-28 05:53:47,[deleted],8

1. The Formation,the playstyle by pirlo i can see it and when it clicks the opponent defense has a really hard time doing anything against it,its very fluid its like we have 4 attackers at a time.

2. Today it was a great progressive performance,the team was just missing some final passes and the opponent keeper was excellent aswell.

3. The team is really adapting to this playstyle more and more and except that inter match this month the team has won every other game so that is a BIG plus.

4. The problems in this team lie on individual basis now i think and some mentality that was lacking which  is now worked upon and its finally showing.",gkk8sbu,l3xw6h,Juve,2021-01-24 21:33:42,xraze007,8

We payed 70 mill for Arthur. No way he’s gonna sit on the bench! I understand he’s been average, but at least he hasn’t been bad(compared to other players in our midfield) he’s new to the country, the playing style, doesn’t know the language and not used to a good work mentality! 

I honestly believe Arthur is a great player, he just needs to find himself. He’s young, and he’s got the eye of an eagle! He needs to learn how to do 2 touches to get the ball moving faster, but let me tell you. This man is an absolute gem. I remember him doing a crazy tackle against Napoli in their half, and really convincing me; he has some fighting spirit in him!!

Khedira is gone in a few months anyway and all our other midfield options have actually shown at least some glimpse of why we would want to keep them.

Due to his wages we have to keep giving him game time taking away time from better players and weakening the team on the pitch.

"I don’t think the midfield is out biggest problem.

Fabrota is good, but sometimes he doesn’t have that extra umpf needed against stronger teams when they feel extra inspired.

Edit: Perhaps Betancur and Rabiot are a bit inconsistent this season.",gk4xacl,l2ckyq,Juve,2021-01-22 11:10:39,pswdkf,2

"Szczesny, Cuadrado, Arthur are my Men of the Match. Szczesny alone kept 2 Napoli goals off the scoreline. Cuadrado really in a Top 5 form, he's been so good. Arthur had a really solid game and just adds to his consistent performances. Wish we would put him in a more advanced position but he had more than a few passes that undid Napoli's defense and he's so good at diffusing pressure.

Nods to McKennie, as well as Berna &amp; Rabiot coming in as solid subs. Midfielders and forwards did a good job in support this time (Pirlo must have gave them an earful after Inter). We soaked up midfield pressure better today and we were prompt in pressuring them defensively. 

Berna could really be a serious LWB option for us, he's had a good season on the left wing and continues to be a consistent contributor there. His biggest upside is his defensive workrate, I could see him even transitioning to a proper LB if he wanted to.

Barring injury, McKennie and Arthur need to be starting in the midfield. We need to find a spot that Chiesa can fit into where he can excel like he was in that 2-3 game stretch. I personally think him and Cuadrado can coexist, even excel, on the right wing together. 

Kulusevski needs to be a half second quicker in his decision making and he'd be an undeniable starter for us. I wish he had nabbed a goal today, we need all of our forwards in good form heading into the second half of the season but he seems to be in a rut. 

Huge mental win for us today, gotta use this as motivation to fire up a good run in the league and CL.",gjzwp3l,l1jop3,Juve,2021-01-21 06:39:02,jbogs7,5

"McKennie proved once again to be fundamental, and to work really well in tandem with Arthur.

Really like how Cuadrado played as if nothing changed since his last game. Even at the 95' he managed to run incredibly fast and was clever enough to pass the ball to Morata. Which is not something one should give as granted, imo.",gk01mev,l1jop3,Juve,2021-01-21 07:19:35,ScarySpread7,6

Have only 1 complain. Our defense need to stop inviting pressure by themselves by holding the ball too long. Just give it to Arthur. Both Chiellini and Bonucci hold the ball and get panick when opponents come pressure. The Napoli's penalty is example of that. Chiellini thinking he's Neymar trying to dribble unnecessary and then kick the ball out for throw in. Napoli came and get penalty. This happens lots of time.,gjzv7g1,l1jop3,Juve,2021-01-21 06:27:11,Ben_Shapiroo,3

"MOTM for me was Szezney. Closely after that, Cuadrado and Arthur.

My ratings:

Chiellini: 6.5/10. (Solid defensively - did his job)  
Bonucci: 7.0/10. (Solid and good forward play)  
Cuadrado: 8.5/10. (Excellent return)  
Chiesa: 5.5/10. (Put out of position on the left and suffered because of it. Not effective)  
McKennie: 6.5/10. (Solid and energetic as usual)  
Bentancur: 7.0/10. (One of his better matches this season - very helpful defensively)  
Arthur: 8.0/10. (Great at keeping possession and forward long passes. Very helpful)  
Kulusevski: 6.0/10. (He was okay but lost possession or had misplaced passes)  
Szezney: 9.5/10. (Amazing. Saved the team with world-class saves and high energy)  
Ronaldo: 7.0/10. (Scored a goal lifting everyone up. Did his job)  
Danilo: 6.0/10. (Okay game.)

Subs didn't play long enough to get a rating, but Morata and especially Bernadeschi were really effective. Rabiot was solid as well and was helpful.",gk03omz,l1jop3,Juve,2021-01-21 07:36:43,[deleted],2

"I still believe this is just a phase, i said it before and i'll say it again, we lost because our 1v1 defending were waeker than Inter, period. 

&amp;nbsp;

Hakimi and Barella dominated the shit out of jogging-Rabiot and noob-Frabotta, the only thing i blame Pirlo for is not sending Danilo on the left lane to block Hakimi as soon as the second half started and replacing Rabiot with McKenni, and play with both Chiesa and Kulu on right lane, they both had defensive duties in their past teams and i expect them to do well against Ashley young and tired lautaro or Sanchez.  

&amp;nbsp;

Replacing Ramsey who is way more creative than both Bernardeschi and Kulu combined wasn't only a mistake it was a late mistake, and pressing like an idiot against a team who its main strength are counter attack was also dumb, but again, we truly lacked key players to help us build up (Cuadrado  and Dybala), i watched the game again and i just feel bad for Chiesa, everytime he got the ball, he was surrounded by 3 players, and none of his teammates made any decent positionning to help him. 

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, other than Chiellini and also Bonucci and Danilo, everyone else defended like they don't give a fuck, maybe they were tired from the Coppa game ?
or maybe it simply wasn't our day, but the mentality of Juve was shameful.

&amp;nbsp;

About Allegri, 

I think my most downvoted comments here where the ones that i defended Allegri in, i really really loved him, but everyone wanted ""Ronaldo-ready"" team and ""BeAuTiFul FoOtBaLl"", but we can't deny two things about him: 

* It was time for him to leave. 

* this ""shit the bed period"" also happened with him, especially in CL, when one week we look like the best team in the world, and the next we get kicked out by Ajax, the only difference is that back then Serie A team where **way worse** than the current competition.


&amp;nbsp;

So maybe it's time to wakeup and realize that we have been doing mediocre transfers since Ronaldo came, we forever were the team who had the best midfielders in the world, **ALWAYS**, except for the last ~5 years, and we were ""allowed"" to live like that because of how bad serie A teams were, now things are changing, Milan has the best midfield and no doubt they are number 1, it ain't about the manager no more, if anyone need to be sacked, it's Paratici.",gju5mwx,l0k9l9,Juve,2021-01-19 23:22:06,alaslipknot,27

"I’ve watched us being outplayed by Napoli in the Conte era and by Lazio and Napoli in the Alegri. The big difference was that although those teams were strong, Juve was just on a different level. Now we have a Serie A that is actually strong. As much as it pains me to admit, Merda has a strong cohesive team that could have been more competitive in the UCL if it weren’t for some crazy group stage. Atalanta finding ways of being competitive and even doing fairly well at UCL knockout stage. AC Milan also stepped up since last season. We have a stronger Serie A, yet still people compare results with Alegri or Conte era. The opposition is just tougher now. 

I’m thankful to Alegri for bringing the team to the final not once, but twice. However, it was also frustrating seeing the potential of our team and how we turtled up in those finals. Despite having having the supper midfield we had, we’d allow Barcelona to dictate the play and only hit back when we were behind. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid weren’t teams that took their foot off the gas pedal when they were ahead by one goal. Yet we still dictated the play when we went down by one. We tied the game and allowed them to dictate the game at 1-1 again. Granted both really tough finals so I can’t blame Alegri too much. However, I’ve seen too many times the team playing defensively to try to hold to a one goal lead or turtling up against the “European giants.”  I had many heartbreaks with this team in the UCL, but I remember our team being relatively more aggressive in those mid ‘90s finals. 

Perhaps turtling is a bit strong, but you get it right? A final decided in one game and the team plays defensively every time the score is tied. 

It wasn’t a panacea then. Serie A wasn’t as tough then. That pragmatism didn’t give us an European trophy.",gjuaiy9,l0k9l9,Juve,2021-01-20 00:01:05,pswdkf,13
I think this is the direction where they need to look - positioning. Our scheme is very fluid and it is hard for players still it seems. Maybe this fluidity is not a good idea in the end and it should be more balanced in the defensive phase,gjtygm6,l0k9l9,Juve,2021-01-19 22:20:49,Ktulu_Juventus,5
"Pirlo vs Allegri's approach to the game are completely different, there's nearly zero comparison to be made here. 

We're currently trying to play a high pressing attack and we have grandpa Chiellini and Bonucci at the back with a dysfunctional midfield still finding an identity. Of course that isn't going to work. 

In the game vs Inter we were also missing 3/4 starters on defense. 

How about you find images of the worse attacking game from Allegri's tenure (what everyone complained about) and compare it to Pirlo's best. Same exact concept, there's no value in this.",gjuxbpg,l0k9l9,Juve,2021-01-20 02:53:46,jbogs7,10

"Allegri was one of Juve’s best ever managers. I hope he has taken advantage of his time off to reflect about the mistakes he made in his last season at Juve. In his first three seasons, his man-management, squad rotations, and tactical moves were amazing. However, he made several mistakes in his last season, which lead to Juve’s UCL exit to Ajax and Coppa Italia humiliation at the hands of Atalanta.

"Bonucci in 2021 vs 2017 is like the difference between Ramos and Angelo Ogbonna. Without De Ligt the entire team defense falls apart. Chiellini doesn’t have the legs, Leo doesn’t have anything, Demiral isn’t really that good imo (I know many really like him, I don’t see it). This team needs a legit #1CB to pair with De Ligt at least as much as a top midfielder if not more. A strong spine can carry a team and right now this team is being blown apart right up the middle of the pitch every time they lose possession

In the attacking phase this team has shown that it can be quite deadly at times. But the midfield and defense keep letting it down. Solidify those spots and the attack will become more consistent (obv)

(Not to mention Frabotta. He’s been a really good soldier thrust into an impossible situation. It’s not his fault he’s not at the level required. That spot needs addressing too with Sandro not always fit)",gjv4kud,l0k9l9,Juve,2021-01-20 03:49:21,jarpio,2

"Of course. Such post was suppose to be someday. The scale of the individual of CR7 is too big so it's so easy to blame him in every problem of the club.

Juve's win streak was supposed to be interrupted already 2 years ago. Allegri's Juve exhausted the potential already at the moment of Cristiano's arrival. Current state of complete rebuild could've started much earlier and with much more big problems. Cristiano in roaster allows club to stay in focus of interest of media and fans all other the world even without success in UCL. We live in age when popularity=money. On the pitch CR7 doing his part of the work good too. Let's non forget that he is getting older. He can fight with time but he can't win this war. But he will change his role if he have to. This is what I'm sure. And I'm saying this, man who almost hated him in Real. Now Cristiano is very different player, much more team player.

Juve's current difficulties isn't about one player. It's about few board decisions in last couple years. Unexperienced coach, many new young players, no pre-season, injuries, covid-positives. And let's don's forget that rivals worked their hearts out to close the gap between us. So now Agnelli have 2 options: 

1. Follow fans hysteria and replace Pirlo with... With who btw? Is there any top-class coach available?

2. Follow initial decision and give Pirlo time to work, to learn, to evolve. Risky? Yes. But we already on this path. It's stupid to run back when Juve only made couple steps.",gjqd05i,kzw3ls,Juve,2021-01-19 00:25:55,angry_rusman,3
"It’s the board fault. They stupidly thought signing a superstar with their older weakening team will give them a UCL title. Ronaldo wanted to leave Madrid and juve gave him a big ass contract. Ofc he would accept it and his stats and performances speak for themselves. Scored every single UCL knockout goal since arriving here. Juve got no money after giving him more money than they should have and their midfield been shit since he came here. Defense isn’t bad but no where near 2010-2017 juve defense. Juve stars left, gotten old, and board forgot football is a team sport and an aging superstar(still top 2-3 player) will carry them. Delusional tbh and ppl blame Ronaldo is hilarious. Jersey sales social media presence etc helped juve tremendously. He’s by far their best player. Imagine his stats if he had even a decent midfield.

"Not sure, if you are saying Ronaldo is the problem:no. He makes that money back easily and makes Juventus an even bigger club. He scores a lot and is important. I think Juventus made the mistake of signing too many mediocre players especially on the midfield position(not the first time this mistake was made)

 The only worldclass players are Ronaldo, De Ligt and in good form Dybala. LB and RB: mediocre at best, midfield: mediocre. You can't win matches with a good CB and a good attack only. Add to that that Pirlo is a pretty weak coach and you get inconsistent performance. 

And Juventus just completely fails when it comes too youth players. Weak positions in other teams like Ajax, Dortmund and Barcelona are often replaced by youth players. De Jong leaves, Gravenberch steps up. Suarez leaves, Fati steps up. When Haaland leaves Dortmund allready have a good youth striker. 

I think this is a huge problem for Juventus, not only would youth players fit in better because they allready know the playing style, it would also save a lot of money that is now going to signing players.

Game quality - still he scores the majority of goals and without him we were much poorer (if you remember those couple of weeks).

"Here is the simple truth neither Ronaldo nor Juventus adapt to each other.

If you analyse Juventus games they rarely have perfect game.

Well, we wasn't good enough, but we gonna work this out. It's not how Juve players must react. And problem is Pirlo as motivator. He is great mind, but I don't see him as motivator. Remember Max Allegri. He was stylish in his suit , but how emotional he was! And his team was same.

"This team went shit after Agnelli and Nedved fired Marotta. 
It is not Pirlo's fault but stacking with players like Buffon, Frabotta, Chiellini and Bonucci and so on. 

Rabiot, Bernardeschi, Dybala, Buffon, Chiellini, Bonucci (that's around 30m in wages and 1 foreign spot open up), should simply be shown their way out of the team like they did with Del Piero, Khedira, Matuidi, Mandzu, Allegri and Marotta. 

Demiral and De ligt should always start, same goes for Schezny.

We've no defensive midfielders bar Bentacur who plays a decent game every once in a while.
Same goes for RB and LB. 
Ramsey is the only midfielder with a dept vision.

This team is shit whenever Morata and CR are on a bad day, they've been carrying the team on theirs shoulders for months now.

At this rate I don't even see Juventus qualify for Europa League and we've got to play Naples still.
Paratici as turned out to be a massive joke of sport director, being able only to make massive signings on massive waves or free agents declining still on massive wages.

Suarez saga is the perfect example.

We've won against Barca, because Barca team is even worse than ours atm and Milan didn't destroy us because they were playing with just 4 first team players.

Reality hits hard but they're probably going to blame COVID, I've never seen Agnelli back down from one of his wrong decision and he'll do the same this time.

He'll just blame Covid, closed stadiums and economy crack, he'll find new investors to get into the CDA, inject tons of money into the project and waste them on 30y.o. who are just looking for a top tier retirement team.

Back to reality. We have extremely predictable play which is unbelievable coming from a person like Pirlo who's brilliance as a player we all know. Don't know why he can't transfer his vision to the team. Our defence is too often left exposed and gets overwhelmed.
We should really change things up with our formation and introduce some consistency in the first team.
We had similar situation under Sarri. Forcing a formation around players that can't fit in it rather than finding a suitable formation for the available players.

Playing 3-5-2 is the way to go with the current set of players. Might sound predictable and boring but it will give us plenty both in attack and defence.

It’s a strange season because of Covid. But stick with one formation. Bentacur is not a playmaker. Arthur should play every game because he is the only playmaker we have. Ronaldo shouldn’t be unreplacable. If he plays bad then substitute him. Frabotta is not a juve player. He fits well in teams like Parma etc. to Everybody who say ‘he is young’, he is not younger than de ligt. 
The inconsistency just pisses me off and the lack of motivation of the lads. The coach has to do something. Not just substitute berna and kulu around 70’",gjpn3cr,kzppon,Juve,2021-01-18 19:37:06,Grumpy23,-1
I think this game can be summed up by that play where Chiesa fought off Lukaku and about the entire inter midfield to try and win the ball while 4 juve players stood and watched.,gjnhutm,kzfqzg,Juve,2021-01-18 05:44:55,BenjaTheGreat,109
"Inter has been criticized a lot for not having a Plan B (especially in their CL run this season). Many teams mirrored their formation and were able to hold off their typical movements in attack.    
I struggle to understand what was Pirlo's plan against the well-known Conte's system today. They consistently were able to penetrate the entire midfield with two or three quick passes, Hakimi was allowed tons of space with Barella and Vidal running circles around Bentancur and Rabiot. Lukaku alone could've easily had a hat-trick. Skriniar-Bastoni-De Vrij were barely even bothered throughout the game.    
On another note: constantly berating the current midfield roster isn't helpful and the coach has to take part of the blame for their performances. I haven't seen any progress from midfielders except McKennie so far and Bentancur has arguably regressed compared to last season.",gjnhs85,kzfqzg,Juve,2021-01-18 05:44:21,pliqtro,72

"All the people who unironically say things like “oh but you guys wanted Allegri/Sarri gone” don’t realize that Allegri and Sarri were literally sacked because of the same trigger-happy, reactionary attitudes y’all are putting on today. Sarri and Allegri were both right that this team needs a proper rebuild. That’s underway now but we still have several holes to plug up. Useless to sack Pirlo right now, we’ve made real progress since the start of the season.

I get it, it’s Inter. We all fucking HATE losing to Inter. But get a grip. This is our first loss in a good while, against a full strength good Inter team, missing our first choice right back, first choice left back, and first choice CB. Pirlo didn’t exactly have a ton of options back there. People calling for Demiral didn’t watch the Sassuolo game, otherwise idk what to tell you. Demiral wouldn’t have changed anything in this game. I like Arthur but just like everyone else in this team today, he’s allergic to forward passing. I think people who have problems with the lineup put out today are really grasping at straws. It didn’t matter who was out there. 

Conte absolutely outcoached Pirlo today, no two ways about it. But this game isn’t only on Pirlo. Ronaldo was dribbling into cones and crossing into the sky, Morata did nothing, every single player had AT LEAST 3 occasions where they passed it to literally nobody. Some of the challenges in midfield were hilariously bad. This was just an absolutely terrible game from everyone, but these things HAPPEN. They especially happen when you’re missing key players, in a congested calendar, in a season where every single big European team has had SEVERAL absolute stinkers (except maybe Milan).

"Hate anyone you want but reality is we need proper rebuild.

Changing coaches won't do miracle. Sarri (who has been one of best coaches when he was at Napoli) sucked at Juve. We tried new approach with Pirlo and he sucks as well. It is not about coach, it is about whole player structure.

Bonucci and Chielini aren't shadow of players that they used to be. Fullbacks except Cuadrado are so average that it is funny that they are even playing at Juventus. Washed ""young"" players like Bentacur who is still considered a potential when reality is he is bang average player. In same bracket you could put Dybala who shines one game and then disappears for next ten. 

On other side; Ronaldo, Morata, Chiesa, McKennie, DeLigt, Tek, Cuadrado and even Kulu (as supersub atleast) showed that they can be a focal point for a rebuild.

Agnelli show some money, get a world class playmaker, solid fullbacks and backup striker. Also Alaba contract is expiring and pairing him next to De Ligt sounds like an very good solution.

"Chiellini and Danilo were decent defensively. Tek did his job good enuf, bonucci and frabotta continue to show us they suck defensively

Everyone single mid fielder besides mckennie sucked today plain and simple 

Ramsey was bad, chiesa tried hard but only had 1-2 plays of quality and kulu looked good but nothing happened.

Bad game from Ronaldo but at least we saw him to stuff(little good most bad). Morata been bad since Christmas and he was completely nonexistent today.

We have injuries and covid cases but main problem is our midfield consistency, as a result we expect morata chiesa Ronaldo to create goals out of nothing(they do it most of the time today wasn’t that day)

Pirlo tactics only work with a good midfield that can make passes and work in tight spaces. It also requires pressing which only mckennie does great as a mid fielder.

"Today Conte simply prepared for us exactly the way they needed - he probably got stiff when we released the starting XI and saw a backline of Frabotta/Chiellini/Bonucci/Danilo. Absolutely flattened us on the counter, defended well, shut down our creators. 

Putting faith in Frabotta is good of Pirlo I think, but he had a rough previous game and needed this one off. Demiral would have probably been a better idea, or Bernadeschi even. He was severely outclassed by Hakimi and Barella, and in previous games we are used to having our RB drift up and 3 stay back. I don't think Frabotta/Danilo were on the same page and because of that, Chiellini and Bonucci got worked hard.

Missing De Ligt, Sandro, and Cuadrado wasn't ideal for us today either. But Pirlo *needs* to be starting McKennie and Arthur in big games like these. We needed that outlet to suppress the counter, Arthur is so good to dump the ball to and let diffuse an attack. McKennie should be starting every game at this point. I don't understand what the plan was with the midfield and they seemed confused too. Out of sync the entire game, poor attacking and terrible defense.

"Few key points people need to wake up to:

- Frabotta has no business being a starter for Juventus in big matches. He's young, he can grow, but he's nowhere near being good enough to deserve it. Pirlo was naive to not insist on a proper left back rotation. Paratici was incompetent to not make it a priority. 

- Bentancur and Rabiot are extremely average players that sometimes can look good. Respectively, the only thing they both can do well is pass the ball on the side or to the back. As for the rest? Nothing. Incapable of dribbling, clumsy when tackling, not confident enough to shoot. Just filler players, the ones that start as substitutes and go in the game to slow the tempo down.

- Pirlo screwed up by starting the two above against inter. The first half was a joke, no build up, no holding of the ball. Inter steam rolled us the entire half. 

- Without our starting three out of four defenders , it's not the end of the world that we lost today. It clearly wasn't our best team, and having Bernardeschi play as a left back is enough of a reason to see why it didn't go our way today.

- Chiellini is a fucking gorilla and I love him. Only player that looked good today and showed some grinta.",gjni34m,kzfqzg,Juve,2021-01-18 05:46:33,dudeinred69,8

And Bentancur, he isn't a bad player, but he never performs well with only one other central midfielder (not counting Ramsey since he plays too high up). Speaking of Ramsey, surely you can't keep playing him and not letting Kulu start? I know he's supposed to run between the lines and provide a spare man but he just isn't good enough.

"I'll just expand on a comment I made in the match thread, because I think Juve's woes this season has a very simple explanation when you get down to the basics (and yeah, I wrote this during the game since I pretty much gave up on watching, which is why it's so long).

This game exemplifies the difference that a clear sense of the team's tactics among the players can make.

Imagine that you have a task that you are supposed to perform. Your boss tells you (and you also very much know) that this is the most important iteration of this task that you'll perform this year.

Now imagine these two alternatives:

1. You know this task well, the boss has let you know exactly what you are supposed to do, when you are going to do it, and you have had time to do this dozens of times before.
2. You are not quite sure about this task. You have had to change the way you perform it each time as the instructions from your boss keeps changing, your boss keeps changing too, and even the colleagues that are cooperating with you on this task change often as well.

If alternative 1 is true, then it will be easy for you to perform the task with the expected results, and now that it's a special occasion, you'll be able to give even a bit extra and perform it at even more than 100%, and you get fired up at the prospect.

If alternative 2 is true, how can you even be sure that you'll be able to perform the tasks with the bare minimum expected results? Sometimes I bet you'll do fine, and sometimes something might happen that allows you to push through with your individual skills that are relevant to the current particular circumstances; but you won't be sure that you can do the same thing next time. Giving more than 100% is completely out of the question. You don't get particularly fired up even though you obviously want to do well, because you have to stop and think and ask questions too often.

This is really the difference between Milan/Inter and Juve this season. Milan and Inter are both operating in well oiled systems where the players are sure of their place in the lineup and know what they are supposed to do (even if some players are missing), whereas Juve have so many variables going into each game that they have to rely on an individual performance brought about by chance in order to perform the way they are expected to. That's why Juve is so woefully inconsistent.

It's very telling that a team is not functioning properly when fans are putting too much hope into substitutions, like thinking that if McKennie or Kulusevski comes on, things will change and the team will be better. A functioning team will not be dependent on those individual players and substitutions, because the team itself would work well anyway, and a substitution would be of a functional nature rather than a form of CPR.

I don't really blame Pirlo for this as I felt like this was coming even from the beginning of the season. There are too many new players, too many variables with injuries, Covid, and more for him to be able to instill a sense of security in the players within a few months.

I still think that Juve *could* win the title, but it will surely depend on individual players and the strength of the squad rather than some sort of tactical brilliance and team chemistry. It's really a testament to the quality of Juve's players that they are even near the top of the table. Just look at what happened to teams like United or Arsenal when a long time manager disappeared. The insecurity that it leaves behind can wreck a team for years, even if the new manager's tactics are sound on paper, and then when they decide to stick with a manager (like Ole) they slowly get better and better and eventually find their stride again.

If Pirlo were to get replaced, there will be no Prince Charming that saves the team from its issues and brings it to the ball at the magic castle. There will need to be consistency and clarity in every aspect of the team for it to work in the future.",gjnhsr0,kzfqzg,Juve,2021-01-18 05:44:28,Krankelibrankelfnatt,3

"Let's start from the back. 

Bonnucci should be the 4th choice CB. He's been far far below Juve standard for well over a year now, and he's not even providing the passing he's known for. The best words I have for him are fragile and slow. Rotating between Demiral, DeLigt, and Chiellini gives confidence. It was great to have King Kong back and he's head and shoulders superior to Bonnucci. Danilo, Cuadrado, and Frabotta are decent enough although the latter needs to be more disciplined. Hopefully Cuadrado can come back soon. 

In the midfield, the English commentators noted it several times: a lack of creativity. Most of our creativity comes from the right wing and that's not enough. Why on earth Pirlo trusts Bentacaur is beyond me. He has a bit of talent, but should be a sub. He's good for a good play or two against weaker sides. It's telling that NO ONE looks to pass to him unless he's the only option. He slows down attacks singlehandedly. A starting role is too much for him. Certain players can take on certain burdens and Pirlo needs to recognize this, and implement this by putting players in a position to succeed. McKinne has a much better mindset. It really should not be this labored or difficult to play some balls into the forward lines. Morata and CR7 drop and no one recognizes it. 

With the attack, Ronaldo needs to work on his short passing. It's a toss up if he can pick a pass when he receives it. 

It's a poor loss. Jury is still out on Pirlo, but we need to figure it out quick. The Old Lady demands excellence and this current form is not it.",gjnhqd7,kzfqzg,Juve,2021-01-18 05:43:57,[deleted],2

"Garbage. At least if we were taking risks in attack, putting on the pressure, and being creative, but just came up short, I could walk away from this game somewhat happy, but there is little good to take away from this game. We had nothing good. Midfield was bland until McKennie came in and had that good combination play that led to our best chance of the game, but it was too little too late. It was a coin toss as to whether Ronaldo would keep the ball each time he touched it and the attackers as a whole were disjointed. Granted it is hard to penetrate through such a dense defense, but that's what playing it wide and crossing is for, which we absolutely suck at. Our set pieces are poor too. I don't think I've ever seen us score from one in recent memory. It was a one-sided game and Inter had the well-deserved win. We brought nothing to the table today.

"Two things about pirlo that i dont get:

1. Why is it that the midfielder that isn’t on the field is always better, one week rabiot looks good other benta other week arthur most weeks mckennie but usually whoever comes on is the better/best midfielder

2. Pirlo doesn’t seem to respect or believe defenders are that important. He himself played cb sometimes way back. I think he feels as long as you run and can make passes that position can be played with. Look at the players he tried as fullback and even switched up left sided and right sided players in a way that put them in a shaky position. Most coaches think defenders and goal keepers need the most experiece before being thrown in there and usually try forwards that are young into the field to get some playing time.

"The mentality wasn't there, our CB pair was bad. We really need to start relying on Demiral more. Midfield nonexistant, Frabotta not good, Ramsey not good.

I really do not understand how can they STILL start when we have McKennie and Arthur on the bench. 

Arthur might still be bloody useless, but at the very least he can hold the ball and relieve pressure for the team. That's something.

Frabotta, despite his efforts, has no place in Serie A team. He's made for the lower leagues and he demonstrated it once again tonight.

I think the problem with Pirlo's playstyle Is that its so exhausthing. We often dominate the first 30-45 min but then were gassed and a small mistake happens at some time and we concede. Against bigger teams that Attack more we are going to defend more and the players dont run as much as we were attacking hence we player better in the end. Especially when smaller teams just park the bus we run out of time to score the winning goal. I think that after corona Pirlo's playstyle Is gonna flourish when the schedule isnt so packed.,gj5qe0k,kwq9g1,Juve,2021-01-14 05:43:27,jaakkola16,24

"I think one of the most standout youth players in the match was Dragusin.

His ability to play the ball forward from the back was really surprising, confident, solid and sometimes really good. He only made one mistake that I can recall with not marking his player which led to a conceded goal, but this can happen to anyone. Other than that mistake, okay to good defending.

Pretty good for his first real match in the first team, and is 100% worth working on and can only become a very good defender in the future for the first team.

I think it would have been better for Demiral to be the RCB instead though, and had Dragusin as the central CB.",gj723k6,kwq9g1,Juve,2021-01-14 12:28:27,[deleted],7

"Dragusin plays with an experienced head. Smart forward plays and he reads the offensive opponent well. Important to note it was against a young Genoa team, but that was better than any game Rugani had last year. Glad he started. 

Playing Bentacour is a complete risk. He lunges into idiotic challenges without hesitation. 3 yellow cards in less than 160 minutes, he doesn't learn. He's now an experienced player so this stupidity MUST be fixed or he has to go sorry. Glad Pirlo is realizing this and subbing him immediately. 

Berna, Kulu, Chiellini, Morata, Arthur played well. Wesley and Portanova had good sparks but often showed their inexperience both offensively and defensively, which is expected. Credit to Rafia, he was not good in the 2nd half but turned on in ET. Good they got minutes.",gj5w2u3,kwq9g1,Juve,2021-01-14 06:25:19,wolfs217,16

I good as Ronaldo has been for us and he's been amazing but he does deserve criticism for his last three games. We could have been up in this game could have been done in the first half with almost a hat-trick from him. Other than that the team showed a lot of fight to get back into the game and I enjoyed it,gisyuhr,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 05:57:56,WhyAlwaysMe1991,8
"on the one hand we were good in some phases and hand nice combinations, on the other hand to me it often seemed as we were unexperienced, we have to use our chances, we had bad luck with two injuries and chiesa didn't coninue his great performance since that one foul, i though it was a good idea from pirlo to press high after the first goal and try to score the second one ans close the game, but maybe it was a bit too much, we should  defend better in these situations, some player (like arthur) just defended halfhearted",gisy0jm,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 05:51:21,maxl44,1
"Good thing that morata is back . 
Ronaldo should either be rested or benched next game. 
Danilo is our motm, our most reliable player this season.  
We urgently need a creative mid like de paul and a LB . We be out there making sassuolo look like prime barca. 
I have said this before , you can disagree but imo dybala doesn't create much of a duo with anyone . Its either his or ronaldo's individual brilliance when they play together . They doesn't go well as a team as much as when morata starts .",git2z5c,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 06:30:12,maestroPirlo,1
"Slowly and surely this team is taking shape. It's wins like these that won't be remembered but really are crucial, the opposition is a man down and has just tied the game; they'll park the bus and stifle us in the midfield. To not lose our heads and go on and manage this win; I'd say it was a good performance. 

We still need to tidy up some ends though, 
1. Danilo was great in this game but he's been wildly inconsistent in his time with us, needs to put in another of these tidy performances over the next 4 games
2. Frabotta is a young kid, he took a lot of flak from the sub during the first half, maybe Pirlo needs to put an arm around his shoulder and compose him
3. We need to stitch a good string of clean sheets",gisyuch,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 05:57:54,zak89garnett,1
I am really happy with Fabrotta. I know he made a few really bad mistakes today but it was a good assist for Ramsey's goal and he was fairly solid overall. This is the first time since Marchisio that we have a youth that can break into the first team we really cant be too hard on him.,git7af8,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 07:04:33,almightystokes,1

"Szezney: 6/10. Did what he could.

Danilo: 8.5/10. Best player on the pitch between a great goal and even greater assist.

Bonucci: 5.5/10. Liability defensively and when it comes to leadership. I don't understand what's wrong with him.

Demiral: 6.5/10. Didn't have much to do but did what he could. Solid return.

Ramsey: 6.5/10. Scored a goal. Had some shots.

Rabiot: 6/10.

Arthur: 6/10. Made some errors and bad calls. Not his best game. But it wasn't a lot of people's best game.

Chiesa: 6.5/10. Energetic and lively as usual. Glad he didn't get injured with that ridiculously bad foul on him.

Frabotta: 6.5/10. Great at cutting in the left flank and crossing. Ultimately lead to him giving an assist.

Ronaldo: 6/10. Missed chances he shouldn't have, but scored a goal. Not his best game.",gisz417,kunxpp,Juve,2021-01-11 06:00:01,[deleted],-4

"Despite the result it was a bad game for us. Rarely or never playing passes in space, lob passes or through passes. This is making us very predictable and easy to stop and makes us reliable on individual skill sets. 

Sassuolo were much better in keeping possession and making that possession effective.

I think a game like barça will give good results. But the press should be constant throughout the 90 minutes
Marking has to be spot on while defending, as their forwards can score from distance as well

Bern should be starting as lwb to give some pace and attacking threat to the left flank and chiesa is fixed at rwb atm
In defence should be merih-bonucci-chiellini as playing Danilo would risk him for the inter Milan game

For midfield Arthur mckennie Ramsey would give enough creativity and our wingbacks and forwards are highly creative as well so that shouldn't be an issue anyway

&amp;#x200B;

"Scezny: handled what he could well. Proved he can be trusted not to make a mistake with the ball at his feet too. 6.0

Danilo: continues his fine form, made a very important challenge towards the end on Theo I think it was, or maybe Diaz. 6.5

Bonucci: led the defensive line with experience and confidence needed of Il Capitano. Never put a foot wrong in defence, precise on the ball and excellent off it. 7.0

De Ligt: another good performance, only outshadowed by Bonucci's performance of the season up until now. Love how physical he is and his timing is almost impeccable. 6.5

Chiesa: MotM for me, what can you say about those two beauties except that he probably deserved a third and might've got it if he didn't get injured (was he? was too busy celebrating to see what happened). 8.5

Frabotta: excellent first half, very confident and made some great runs with the ball. Let's not forget the jump in competition this lad made this season and he's handling it brilliantly imo, although his nerves tend to show a bit. 6.5

Bentancur: wanted to kill him for that backheel in our box in the first 5-10mins which almost led to Castillejo scoring. He was very good besides that, always hustling and managing to get some great tackles in whilst distributing the ball very well. Showed why Arthur isn't starting yet. 7.0

Rabiot: I might need to watch the match again to judge our midfielders better, but my first take is that Rabiot was incredible. Especially when using his strength and balance carrying the ball forward, managing to single-handledly transition our play and hurt Milan with a great pre-assist for the third goal. 7.5

Ramsey: wasn't very good tbh. Was very surprised when Pirlo didn't take him off, but subbed Dybala out instead. But maybe that was because Chiesa got injured. He made too many mistakes for a midfielder with a reputation as his. I like him and would feel bad if it happens because you can see he's trying, but if he continues like this, he needs to go. 5.5

Dybala: completely unplayable, seems to finally be back to his best form. I was shocked when Pirlo took him out, but it was probably a tactical sub in hindsight. Overshadowed only by Chiesa. 8.0

Ronaldo: Milan almost took him out of the game completely. Still played a wonderful, wonderful pass for McKennie (?) which led to a shot that Donnarumma magically kept out. Had one or two good runs and just by being Ronaldo he serves as a great distraction. Have to say we still need to use him a bit better/more often, because he sometimes makes dangerous runs but doesn't get the ball and even though we shouldn't *always* look for him I'm pretty sure he'll create something most of the times. 6.0

McKennie: Just love this guy. Wild Wild Wes! Took his goal brilliantly and his energy was vital to seeing the game off safely. 7.0

Arthur: probably one of the most press-resistant players out there. Would love to know why Pirlo doesn't see him as a starter, although with Benta playing like this I dont blame him. 6.0

Bernardeschi: don't remember seeing to much of him to rate, will have to watch the match again

Pirlo: forgot about Il Mister. I think he prepared well, we managed to completely neutralize Hernandez and for the most part Calhanoglu. I'm fine with the subs too, they were well-timed. 7.0",gicpzfp,krxx24,Juve,2021-01-07 06:10:20,rndmlgnd,9

"Awesome game. Chiesa balled out, Rabiot was solid especially in the 2nd half by playing a key role in the 3rd goal, Dybala did great in the 1st half, Frabotta was also a pleasant surprise especially early in the game with those crosses, Kulu had an awesome flash of brilliance with that assist, McKennie was solid as always, De Ligt solid too, Bentancur super sketchy, Ronaldo was practically invisible. We played really well, but for some reason we kept making some super stupid mistakes.

"The ref has been a disaster:

- Missing a yellow to Hernandez for the knee on Chiesa's back
- Milan's goal should have been disallowed for a foul on Rabiot at the start
- Dybala fouled by Castillejo, fourth man says it's foul and the referee says no
- Yellow card to Danilo completely invented, it's not even a foul as he got the ball
- Bentancur should have gotten a second yellow for the foul on Castillejo, 70th minute and 1-2 for us
- There was a penalty for Milan at the 93rd minute, Rabiot doesn't touch the ball and hits a Milan player in the box
- Ronaldo holding Hernandez during a counter-attack, should be a yellow for tactical foul and ref didn't even whistle the foul

Terrible terrible Irrati. And ref team. And the end of the first half he even got ganged up by Juve players (complaining about Milan's goal) and nobody helped him! He was left alone arguing with players instead of telling them to shut up and thankfully Pirlo came to de-escalate the situation.",gietelc,krxx24,Juve,2021-01-07 17:57:40,FurlanPinou,3

"Chiesa and dybala were amazing.
Back 4: de ligt a rock, Danilo and bonucci were solid and frabrotta made a mistake or two but was a good spark
Midfield: bentancur was horrible, rabiot wasn’t good in 1st half but much improved in 2nd half. Mckennie was excellent sub with goal and constant running
Attack: Ronaldo wasn’t his classic great self but did his job well by attracting defenders and giving space to dybala and especially chiesa. Too flashy and gave possession away twice cheaply but was solid overall.
One of the few overall great games we’ve played(besides bentancur he was lone black spot)",gicoi8d,krxx24,Juve,2021-01-07 05:59:35,Trick_Confidence_419,6

"Here are my takeaways:

\-Terrible terrible refereeing: The rabiot foul pregoal may be debatable, but can't believe a single yellow on Hernandez BUT a yellow card on Danilo after a clean tackle hahaha. The worrying thing is this isn't the 1st match with those atricious decisions.

\-Chiesa MOTM. Hopefully he didn't go out because an injury

\-Dybala looked real good, today he is on his way on deserving that 10 like the past season

\-Terrible mistakes from bentancur. I think Pirlo put him because he has more physical but I thought this was a match for Arthur to handle the pressure

\-CR7 didn't shine tonight but he drew a lot of men and having him  on the pitch gives the rest the  mentality to fight all game. I still don't understand why he got mad after the Chiesa shot

\-Frabotta looks promising but made a couple of mistakes because of his age

\-The defensive line were too deep IMO. Maybe Pirlo put it like that to prevent end line crosses/shots, but I felt there were too many shots from Milan.

\-Szcezny brilliant bailing us out in complicated moments

\-Good defending overall. Hopefully the Bonucci haters will calm.",gicnrsq,krxx24,Juve,2021-01-07 05:54:28,Happie-Chan,2

MOTM ronaldo. Bonucci sandro were confused at times and sandro is a liability offensively. Midfield was good and chiesa played great. Dybala showed good progress with goal and work rate. Lucky to not concede another goal or two but some of it can be attributed to lack of concentration. Pirlo Ronaldo chiellini Buffon bonucci gotta clear that up vocally before and during game. Great game offensively as our subs played well too. I’m feeling extremely confident against Milan if we shore up some little things defensively and hopefully morata and cuadrado play(demiral should get some more time too as bonucci drop off is accelerating),gi0dofo,kpuagh,Juve,2021-01-04 07:45:52,Trick_Confidence_419,26

"My hot takes:

Bentancur was probably our best player after Ronaldo. Chiesa also put in a good shift, he's been at a pretty good level ever since he joined imo.

I think Pirlo is chopping and changing too much, I know he needs to keep the players fresh but this team lacks identity. 

Bernardeschi deserves more playing time, he's loads more useful than Kulusevski atm.

"My take on where we are as a whole and not just this game specifically:

Szczesny can't keep a clean sheet. Now I would say the back line is the problem, and to be fair they do make mistakes but when Buffon is in the lineup he can keep a clean sheet. I'm not saying we need a new keeper but maybe Szczesny needs to take some lessons from Buffon and his leadership and organization. Buffon will always keep his players in check or tell them to fix their mistakes (like against Barcelona when he yelled at McKinnie for not closing down on Messi and letting him shoot.) He's very capable of making saves but there's something missing there for sure. 

CBs: There are a lot of bads for me in this area. Bonucci has had some big mistakes recently that have costed goals. And I'm not a hater I'm just being honest. Chiellini is always injured now as well (it was great to seeing him back today). De Ligt has been absolutely incredible and I have loved him since he came from Ajax. I always defended him from the hate he got from the slow start and now he has fully transitioned to the team. Demiral was very impressive before his injury as well. In my opinion De Ligt and Demiral should be moved to be the starters and Chiellini and Bonucci should be used for rotation/groom them to take their places at the club. 

RB/LBs: in my opinion it's like our full backs are all like Marcello from Real Madrid, poor defensively and supposedly good going forward but we don't have that consistently. To be fair Cuadrado has been doing better but they aren't reliable. Some games you get some good crosses from Cuadrado/Danilo/Sandro but it's only flashes of their talents. They can't do it week in and week out. I think this month we need to buy someone who can actually cross consistently. 

Midfield: this is the root of our problems. We lack a creator going forward, the guy to tie our attackers to the rest of the team. Benta hasn't been capable of doing so and I don't think Arthur was the answer either. It'd be nice to get a signing here but I don't think this will get resolved and that's my biggest worry as far as being able to reach Milan and go far in the CL. Don't get me wrong, I like most of our midfielders like McKinnie, personally I like the presence of Rabiot on the field, and Chiesa has been great, but we just don't have that cohesion. 

Attackers: I feel as though in games where we can't score isn't because of the poor performances of our forwards, but it's due to that lack of supply coming from the wings and lack of creativity coming from the midfield. Of course they have had some bad games but I'd blame it on the issues we have elsewhere. Dybala hasn't been great but hopefully today is him turning the page. He is very talented but always seems to be missing that consistency. Maybe this is his chance to find his form as we move on in the 2nd half of the season and the CL. Morata has been fantastic for us and you can see the difference he makes when he is on the field and when he isn't. He's definitely the answer to support Ronaldo going forward. And speaking of the man it is incredible what a almost 36 year old can do. He's truly unstoppable and when he said he liked to play til 40 I never believed him. Now seeing his performance, I no longer have doubts and depending on Lewandowski's performance and how far we get in the CL I really think he can make a push for one more Balon dor.  

Let's get ready for the huge game coming up, Forza Juve",gi0qb69,kpuagh,Juve,2021-01-04 09:29:33,TriidentYT,11

" 

To sum it up, it's a 6/10.

Good attacking hunger, pleased about that. Kinda wanna see more variety on how they develop cause we tend to get predictable after a while. We tend to open up on the wings but no crosses are ever reaching those players. We also force some passes that can be easily cut off thus resulting in a counter attack.

The defensive part is a disaster to be honest. We are getting broken down so easily it's a joke. Luckily for us Udine didn't finish well today. If they had more clinical players we could've witnessed another Fiorentina.

I'm 100% convinced that we must play with 5 in the middle so we can be harder to break down. This can also contribute towards having more variety in attack.",gi0qh5d,kpuagh,Juve,2021-01-04 09:30:58,WardenJack,2

Udine defence was completely checked out leaving him with acres of space, very easy goal for him. Really hope he gains some confidence and plays better.

 They need to remember that the moment he feels that juve aren't a positive environment for him or any kind of negative news to him from inside something like juve doesn't need him any more or salary issues and he will leave this club with full respect just like he did to real

"Having Ronaldo at Juve has been a surreal experience and I’m glad I’m witnessing it...but please don’t extend his contract. At least not at (or near) his current salary. This is an unbalanced, poorly constructed team and it’s so hard to fix that when you’re paying one player about 3 to 4 times as much as much as your next highest paid. The Ronaldo-Juve marriage hasn’t been a disaster but it’s also not been quite what everyone wanted (I think this is true both for Juve fans and non-Juve Ronaldo fans). 

Again, I love being able to watch him play for us, but I think it’s inarguable that this team without Ronaldo, but with an improved midfield, improved fullbacks, and a slightly worse attack, would still be a better team overall. I think with his 30 million in salary space, that’s easily achievable. 

I know this is literally the touchiest subject on this sub so I’m trying to be super diplomatic about this. It’s not about Ronaldo being good enough or not good enough. It’s just literally impossible for him to justify his salary when our midfield has been trash for his entire stay here but his giant salary means we have to go for players like Ramsey and Rabiot instead of REAL solutions. It’s not Ronaldo’s fault, but it’s also directly related to him being on the team making the money he’s making.",ghrvd4s,kokqzo,Juve,2021-01-02 07:49:10,jct1121,7
"Arthur, Chiesa, McKennie, Ramsey, Rabiot, Danilo, Kulusevski, Morata and De Ligt have been the transfers ever since Ronaldo came in. These people aren't ""pinpoint passers"", Ramsey might be fine at that but he's always injured.

"We should let him go when he still has value. We are not PSG or Real Madrid in terms of finances - we can’t afford to spend 100m on a player and not recoup some of it willy nilly.

"One of those comments is not like the others. ""You're so fing bad"" is a pretty legit thing to say. Threats of physical violence aren't cool but if they're coming from half the world away they're pointless.

Footballers sell emotions. The athletic part of the sport is a minor piece of the revenue stream. Rivalries and transfer drama exist only because they force emotional response from the fans. If you sell emotions you're going to have some unpleasant responses come back at you, it's part of the business. It's the same as an actor getting tons of hate for a role they played (I.e. the dude that played Jofrey  in GoT got tons of hate tweets). Welcome to the real world, most of the population is hairless speaking monkeys. The perfect 100% rational and emotionally balanced human doesn't exist, don't expect the public to behave like him.

"It's so lame. You are professional player, public person. You have a social network page open for anyone. And with all this you expect that everyone gonna tell you how great you are and how everyone loves you? Everything is simple: don't want to see anger - make your page restricted, available for friends. But subscribers is money, so they will never do so.

I was always interested, why everyone with such willingness empathize to players, but noone try to look at picture from fans perspective. 

Simple man with simple job, sometimes even more then one, earn money, not very big, for his family. He have not very much joy in life and even less time for joys. So 1-2 evenings in week he want to spend 2 hours to watch a game of his favorite team and to see win or at least will for win from players. This man pay money for broadcast and he knows that his money and money of many, many simple people like him is allow guys on pitch earn enormous salaries. So when simple fan watching game he see a professional player with set of specific skills, not a fellow human with personality. He don't think like ""Damn this guy played like sht 3rd game in the row, but he is good, soft person doing charity, playing nice music and loving his family, so I forgive him"". No, it's not work like that. If player doing his goddamn job bad people angry. And this anger must find a way out. In extreme cases fans can even come to base of team with real destruction. Remember Marseille few months ago or Sporting Lisbon few years ago? So when team of professionals with huge salaries plays bad and give simple man anger instead of joy for his own money, of course most direct and harmless way to get rid of this rage is to write something to player or club social network page. Man feels himself bad and he need to give player to know about this. In most cases all this insults just words. Hard words to express emotions and nothing more. Of course, small percent of crazy people can be dangerous, but most is just let off steam. All this insults not for real life person, but for player from TV. 

So all this hysteria and campaigns is wasting of time and money. You can't be loved for whole world. Somebody always will hate you. So way out of this situation is simple: restrict access to page or create another one, personal for close people only. Open page managed by professional CMMs, personal page only for you.

Kean got the axe too. Danilo turning out to be a pretty important player is icing on the cake, especially in a position cancelo would not have been very good in.

I remember back in my playing days when 4-2-3-1 was everyteams favorite tactic and our two dm’s always passing the ball sideways together or back to the cb’s, never they had the balls to put simple pass to the the AM or wingers or maybe troughball to striker.

"De ligt and demiral have now started 6 matches together, 5 wins 1 draw, conceding only 1 goal. Im sick and tired of hearing the word ‘experience’, these 2 need to start together in big matches. 

This midfield needs Arthur. Without him theres a 20 metre gap between our defense and midfield, and it seems like they just take turns at being regista. Benta is really poor and even when hes not making terrible mistakes, he still adds nothing to this side. Contrary to most people, I think Rabiot needs to start - the only consistent creative outlet we saw today was Chiesa, whenever the ball is with anyone else you just cant see it leading to the final product. Rabiot might be lost when starting next to benta, but with freedom in a proper midfield he drives forward, can pass/cross, and has a finish on him. Rabiot Arthur Mckennie, with Fagioli and Ramsey for depth, should be our midfield template. 

Also credit where its due, this ref was fucking amazing. Very lenient, always let play go on, and 0 bullshit fouls that are seemingly always called",godyxtu,lq0rt3,Juve,2021-02-23 05:42:49,FlanK18,71

We should keep in mind that this season has been crazy. We got a green coach with no preseason. We play every three-four days. That leads to an army of injured players. Just look at Real Madrid. Inter have an advantage because they play only in Serie A. That's why we should lower our expectations. Winning CL and/or Scudetto is not realistic.

I think the 'you have to win everything' mentality was that got us here where we have so many players on the injury list (that could also change the whole team chemistry).This includes Dybala that Pirlo said today he's not improving.

He's made the same mistake in a few games this season (including the Napoli game) but got away with it then. It's something he needs to work on since another mistake like this could literally mean disqualification from the CL (the one he made a few days ago might prove to be just that),go1bvnw,lnmq8v,Juve,2021-02-20 03:01:50,Bagellman,56
"His best games have been those where he's not taking on the distributive duties in front of the defense but rather is there to get the ball from the person who *does* do that (usually Arthur) and focus on breaking up opposition play. If someone else can fill that role and free him up I think he can at least be *good enough.* I still don't think he's going to develop into a world class player -- even in his preferred role, his passing just isn't good enough and he loses concentration too much. However I think, given the right partnership, he won't be a detriment and may be solid enough to let our other players shine.",go1igr1,lnmq8v,Juve,2021-02-20 03:50:40,Mickey_Maus,38

"I'd be happy to sell him at this point, and it's not just because of one mistake or one bad half-season. Maybe 3 years ago when he was pulling the strings for Uruguay at such a ripe young age he looked like he could develop into a world class midfielder, but he's stagnated badly since then.

He has high energy and can put in a decent shift making a nuisance of himself in midfield, but he's just a decent tackler and passer but not world class at either.",go2gqit,lnmq8v,Juve,2021-02-20 08:41:59,droidonomy,9

"He’s a kid. He does much better when there are players around him that support him better. With Arthur, for example, he has a point of reference he can pass to and not lose the ball. Blaming a single midfielder is easy, but the whole department is weak and whole seems less than the sum of its parts. 

Regarding the goal, it’s also easy to miss Szczęsny’s role in it. He didn’t seem to appreciate that Bentancur was in a difficult situation with his players nearby and his back to the rest of the pitch. The pass should have been played wide rather than to Bentancur since Danilo is in a more comfortable position. 

This is not to take a way from Bentancur’s weakness that he is unable to soak up pressure without losing the ball. This is crucial if we want to build from the back. 

He’s no world beater, but I think he does have a role play with the right players by his side. It’s clear that McKennie/Rabiot/Bentancur doesn’t work, but choice is limited. I’m more concerned that our options are Ramsay and Bernardeschi neither of whom can pull their weight.",go3qnz1,lnmq8v,Juve,2021-02-20 16:52:05,spiz,-1
"I completely agree. Bentancur is making a lot of mistakes lately and IMO he'll hardly become a world class player. However, it's very easy to blame him and Bernardeschi for our current condition but I think that the management should be blamed for its lack of vision instead.  
Bentancur and Bernardeschi are playing in the wrong position and it's clear that they're not jolly players (unlike Cuadrado who can fill multiple roles more than decently).  
Furthermore, in the last match we didnt' have Arthur, Cuadrado and Bonucci: our main sources of play.

The point is: what can Pirlo do? He rarely has the opportunity to line up the right players in the right position because of covid, injuries, etc. and he hasn't too many alternatives (look at the bench and you'll often see Fagioli, Da Graca, etc.).

I personally think that:

* currently the squad composition isn't compatible with his soccer idea
* if we'd ever sell Ronaldo we might be able to buy a couple of very good midfielders and, if Dybala would ever find himself, start playing as a true soccer team",go25f5z,lnmq8v,Juve,2021-02-20 07:05:03,mrcointreau,0

He needs his confidence back. The fact that Chiesa is playing a head of him and killing it must ruined his confidence and put so much pressure on him plus his sporadic playing time with no consistent position doesn’t help either.  He use to be the man in fiorentina now his a role player in Juventus. Unfortunately it’s best for his career to move somewhere else. He’s too talented and young to be padoin 2.0.

It isn’t this simple. Of course he’s going to score more goals and get more assists if he’s playing closer to goal. But he isn’t productive when he’s on or off the ball in the opponent’s final third.

"Bernardeschi has performed better as a LM than he has as CAM. As a LM Berna can just play simple football. Defend off the ball. Run and cross. Last season, when Sarri coached Juve, Bernardeschi was usually played as a trequartista in a 4-3-1-2 formation. It’s true that this is one of the toughest roles to play in football, given the defensive and attacking responsibilities. However, his decision-making was extremely poor. A footballer that earns €4 M net per season cannot be this weak at attacking space, making through passes, and general decision-making.

A short term solution is to use Berna as a rotation LM. His contract expires in 2022, and he shouldn’t stay at Juve past that season.

So that leaves midfield positions and full back/wing back positions to find a usable role for him. Those are roles he is less suited for. 

We all know how good he was against atleti but after 4 years at Juve  I think it’s safe to treat that as an outlier. 

Berna could show more at Fiore because he was the best option to use as a wide or central attacker. Ditto (to a lesser degree) for the azzurri. He just isn’t good or at least consistent enough to break into Juves team as an attacking player, which is why he is shoehorned into a jack of all trades type role here.

"you're literally putting out the same lineup Pirlo regularly does, except have Kulu over Chiesa 

the reason he does what he does is because if you play the lineup above, there is zero attacking threat down the left hand side.... meaning Ronaldo will have to hang out wide more often on the ball, rather than being free to make runs into the box.... or you just dont attack down the left at all 

add in we cant create through the middle of the pitch/with our midfielders at all, so we're still going to have major issues in attack.... we'll be 1 dimensional with just playing down the right hand side with Chiesa/Cuadrado alternating crossing balls into the box

"It can look playable in FIFA, but in real world this formation with lineup is impossible and won't gonna work. Pirlo's philosophy based on 2 main things: possession with ball and intensive pressing without ball. In your setup both this things impossible. What happens when we play pure 4-3-3 with CR7 as LW we saw last season. He isn't good for pressing so Sarri was forced to use Matuidi as LCM as backup of Cristiano. But because of this other 2 CMs must cover very big part of pitch. So if one of this CMs is smart, technical regista like Pjanic(now Arthur), who physically can't be good in defensive work, last one CM get a work amount too big for one man. Pressing in such case can't be effective. If we add to this picture high defensive line, we get last year situation when we concede goals in almost every game. Oh, and let's don't forget that Cuadrado in RW relearned to RB. Barzagli done a great job with Juan, but colombian still better in attack than defense. Plus Danilo, with all his universality, naturally RB too.

That's why Pirlo using hybrid 3-5-2. Danilo+Cuadrado gives stability at right side when in attack phase Juan going in RM position. Same works for midfield too. 5 players allow to keep balance of work for each player even in high pressing. Also this setup hide Cristiano's problems in pressing. But for all this work need two important conditions: high workrate of LB and good team movement from start whistle. This setup can't allow bad performance even one player. So when Sandro/Frabotta play bad Juve twice less effective. And if additionally Bentancur making his usual sht, Juve struggle to beat anyone.",gnz6w70,ln4jcq,Juve,2021-02-19 13:35:39,Abarakadavr,7

"I know people will disagree, but we need to work *with* our midfielders, not just expect them to slide right in. We need to develop them to play in through balls. Keep them after the session to improve their passing. Mould each player into who their meant to be, making it easier to plan tactics and what not. 

The training drill: 1 midfielder at the half way line 4 defenders a forward who all reside on the final third line.

Midfielder plays ball forward to an attacker who’s sitting just behind the back 4 to be played in. Once past the defence, attacker try’s to score goal. Rotate positions and players every round

Aim: to improve defence awareness for defenders, improve spatial awareness (especially to stay onside) and communication with midfielders for the attackers and for the midfielders to gain confidence in riskier passing and skill in through balls.

This is just a drill I would recommend for us just as a basis. The midfielders need confidence. We can get to all the more technical plays later, but right now we need to do some relatively basic stuff. 

Also having an attacking midfielder. Either berna or Dybala to link the plays. They should mainly play in the middle, drifting between the lines while sometimes drifting out wide. They shouldn’t be relied upon defensively.",gnw1058,lmnaym,Juve,2021-02-18 22:42:35,_ForzaJuve_,12

"Might be unpopular after last night but I would keep Bentancur and sell Rabiot, Bentancur is decent rotation option and is not on huge wages like Rabiot. I love Ramsey but he is so injury prone that it's not sensible to keep him at wages of a key player. I would even sell Arthur if a good offer comes, people overrate him right now cause he offers something different from other midfielders but I'm not sure of his physical condition, it's a known issue even from Barsa, dude is almost never fit and can't last the whole game.

I think we need a proper DM, someone physical who is a responsible player that doesn't make stupid mistakes, he doesn't have to be a good playmaker, someone similar to Partey or Casemiro.

We also need someone who can operate in smaller pockets(Arthur can do that) and has the ability to drive the ball and make forward passes(not sure Arthur is capable of that), maybe Aouar is that player, only seen him a couple of times so can't say for sure.

But we need much more that midfield, our fullback are poor in attack, except Cuadrado who is a makeshift right-back.

Verratti is currently one of the best if not the best CM, and I think he would be more useful to this Juventus team than Ronaldo.

People look at him today for a player we sold 5 years ago",gnuogxh,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 12:37:28,forzaq8,28
Still think Kean is not good enough to be a starter for us. We got a fair deal selling him. Marotta in his trigger happy days was so desperate to make plus valenza on anyone he could. The price for Coman was a joke,gnuuzrs,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 13:43:53,boudzab,13
"My biggest problem with letting players go is we have yet to get anywhere near our days of Vidal, Pogba, Pirlo, Marchisio. 

Pogba and Vidal left and we got players like Rincon, Hernanes, Lemina, etc.

"Coman and Cancelo were let go because of financial reasons, which more than made sense at the time. Kean is doing well now in Ligue 1, but Everton made an offer we could hardly refuse and it's easy now to say it was a mistake because he just scored against Barça and we sucked ass against Porto.

All in all we got back a player which turned out to be more important than any of those guys ever were in Danilo and a chunk of cash which we desperately needed (Ronaldo don't come for free, nor does Chiesa etc). I'm much more mad about Sarri forcing Emre Can out without giving him a chance when now we have to witness the worst midfield since Del Neri in Rabiot/Bentancur.",gnv0mpg,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 14:52:30,tigull,9
"Kean and Cancelo going were bad business.  Cancelo I’m not sure if he would have stayed long, his record for bouncing club to club shows that. Coman would have never stayed, so is always pointless to bring up.

Best business we did was selling Cancelo. We already had Cuadrado on payroll. Kean wasn’t great for us and Coman wouldn’t be playing over Ronaldo so doesn’t really matter imo,gnyqojn,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-19 10:57:16,ForzaJuventusFC,3
"Seperate them out:

I have no problen with the Cancelo for Danilo plus 30M deal. We have not had a good 2-way FB since Lich, and Cancelo was not filling that gap. Offensively he is great, but I'm not sure he made enough of a difference over what else we had to make up for just how poor he is defensively. We could get away with that if we had 2-3 healthy/great centre backs at their peak, but with the team we've had we couldn't get away with no defensive presence from our FB/WB's.

Coman I thought was clear that he wanted out, and after bringing him on a free transfer, I'm not sure how much leverage we had to try and keep him. It's just ""meh"" of a situation.

Kean was the one that annoyed me, and it was more reflective of the financial whole we had put ourselves in. I have never seen Moise as a true elite talent, but he was good enough to be part of the rotation behind Ronaldo/Dybala, and especially at a team we were trying to force out both Mandzu and Higuian. The transfer fee also didnt make a lot of sense without some sort of buy-back, which was never included/reported. My guess is a combination of: we were screwed financially and he wanted more money than we could afford, so just took what we could get, our club just didnt rate him as a prospect and thought we were selling ""high"", or he had serious conflict with players/staff that forced him out - either some immaturity stuff, that also happened at Everton, or he was (rightly) upset at how little support he got from the club/leaders when exposed to racism by opposition fans.",gnuxgwb,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 14:12:22,moonshadow50,2
"This is a stupid thing to talk about, we have rejuvinated our squad really well considering the corona pandemic, yes we still need at least a world class midfielder like Aouar to bring in creativity but what is affecting us the most now is injuries, no rest and an inexperienced coach who is making errors every once in a while.

We looked insanely positive after the inter defeat, but after the napoli defeat we have looked very bad. I think the jampacked fixture list is catching up to us unfortunately. I would start Fagioli and Frabotta next match, we need rotation now.

But yes, we should have had a buy back option for Kean at least.",gnv08z0,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 14:47:32,SirHenryy,2
"Kean and Cancelo were plusvalenza deals. I don’t think anyone is upset about the Cancelo deal considering how good danilo has been. But just last year people were calling Kean a flop, now he goes and plays with Neymar and Mbappe and we are dumb for selling him? Not hard to score goals with that talent around you. We needed to make money on someone that summer and selling a young Kean who hadn’t proved anything in Serie a was good business",gnw2iep,lmd31p,Juve,2021-02-18 22:54:41,thefonzz91,2

On the other hand, Sandro should've probably seen red so there's that. Referees sometimes compensate. 

In all honesty, we deserved to lose anyways. We should play with more risk going forward. 

Chiesa is our best player atm.

Edit: Porto did a great job defending and especially the high press. Maybe Pirlo can learn something from that, he looked surprised by Porto.

"1. We're absolute shit.
2. Morata coming on made a huge difference in our attacking play. Very bad decision of Pirlo to start Kulu who did absolutely nothing for 70 minutes.
3. Ramsey is exactly what we need for these types of games. Someone that can pass through the lines instead of play one dimensional football.
4. Our 36 year old forward was the only one pressing for the last 20 minutes, says alot about our mentality.
5. We're absolute shit.

The next leg is a good test of whether Pirlo actually has it in him to coach this team. He knows what went wrong this game, now we just have to see how he'll react. We need technical players playing, not donkey Kulusevski. I'm not kidding, you guys go at Berna and Benta all season and just ignore the fact that having Kulusevski on the pitch results in us being a player down offensively.

P.S. Benta is not a regista. Never has been. He's being forced to play there because of the fact that we don't have Arthur available. He's never been solid under pressure especially in the way they pressured him today, most midfielders wouldn't be able to handle that. It's why historically the regista position has some of the smartest technical players. The position is not about making passes to our forwards, it's about absorbing pressure and providing an outlet to connect the defense with the other midfielders. That's exactly why I never understood the hate Pjanic got, he barely made any mistakes and his passing was generally amazing. Arthur fulfills that role, but don't be so harsh on Benta whose natural position is the one Rabiot played today.",gntcgno,lm5t97,Juve,2021-02-18 06:02:16,Misdefined,13
"Even excluding the braindead error, Benta has been absolute dog shit. Hes been completely immobile, out of position, cant make a pass for his life, constant dispossessions, and in the first half Chiellini was constantly making gestures to him to come deeper and find space - its as if theres a 20 metre gap between our defense and midfield whenever he plays. 

Any of yous that thought or still think he should start for us, let alone play fucking regista, please go get a mental test. He was average at best for boca juniors and he only looked ok in his breakout season because pjanic and matuidi declined hard. Give him back to boca for free for all i care, I’d honestly rather sturaro

Edit: 7.5 match rating my ass. and congrats to him, apparently he now has more goal contributions for opposing teams than he does for juve lmfao",gntcfn9,lm5t97,Juve,2021-02-18 06:02:03,FlanK18,12

"Absolute garbage performances. Nothing more to say. Almost all of them should hang their head in shame.

Bentacur, well less said the better. Criminal defensive lapses especially the 2nd goal where 4-5 Juve players, in the box, are just looking like school children kicked in the balls, as Porto scored their second goal.

Non-existent midfield again, poor passing and whats worse, Lazy passing. The team failed to complete basic passing that is football 101, at least at their level. Many of them are trophy winning international players and they simply passed lazily and allowed Porto to intercept and break any forward momentum.

Morata should have played. Seriously i don't expect much from Pirlo but at least show your opponents respect and try to kill off the game earlier or at least take the initiative with an extra attacker. This is not to say that Morata has been anything special and i now know why 2 major clubs have sent him packing because while decent, he is only a bits and pieces striker and not enough to be good throughout the season.

Juve have still not figured out their midfield issues and it has been an issue for a solid 3 years and frankly, for a club of its size, they should be ashamed of it. I do sympathize with Pirlo, at one point he had the look of someone who has been robbed blind in broad daylight, the man just could not believe how bad the team was that they forgot to do basics right.

Finally, as much as i am a Fan, Ronaldo was poor. Simple as that. And he has been for probably a month now. I have noticed he tries fancy dribbling and loses the ball in the final third. It is almost like he is trying too hard. He slips, he falls and he runs into the opposition defenders. His product in the final 3rd is poor. I am glad he was angry but i hope it was at himself as much as his teammates. Anger is good but put some fucking performance to make up for this shit that the team served up.

Frankly, glad Juve got a goal, but i have serious Lyon vibes and i think the team is somewhat of an underdog really to qualify for the Quarters. If they do, pray they play either Dortumond or Sevilla, because i think anybody else will simply play them off the park in the worst possible way, if they keep this shit up.",gntnlof,lm5t97,Juve,2021-02-18 07:25:28,agent300K,4

"Before even talking tactics or substitutions, ref decisions I think it's just a quality issue. The midfield is still in a dire state and struggles moving the ball to the point of resorting to the Allegri days of hoofing it up the field. Good performances from Arthur and McKennie masked the issue for a while but it still definitely exists. Rabiot is not good enough, I don't believe Bentancur is completely hopeless but I think his ceiling is as a super sub. Kulusevski was really poor as well, if playing him at RW in a 4-3-3 is out of the question I'd at least like to try him as an attacking midfielder but even then I feel like his issues are irrespective of what role he's playing in. We're not anywhere near CL winning level but let's hope we can get a result at home and see how far we can go.",gntvsq7,lm5t97,Juve,2021-02-18 08:33:14,firewalkwithme-,5

Juve was outplayed the entire match and did not deserve to even get one goal out of this game.  Pirlo has no experience in coaching and it's hard to get mad at him for tactical errors or mistakes with the line up because it's to be expected from an inexperienced coach. One thing he can be blamed for is not properly motivating/inspiring the team. A lot of Juve's problems this season can be attributed to their apathetic approach to these matches.

Ramsey, missed him, love this man and we need someone like him on the pitch. Still, we need some new guys in the midfield. Benta and Rabiot don't work together but there are not many players that can take their places - Benta's been shit for a long time, can't stand him.

"Insane that a 1-0 gets us through after this horrifying performance. We’re definitely not going far even if we get past Porto though. Arthur coming back would make me feel better. Just not good enough today from anyone. Bentancur absolutely shocking, I can’t take another season of him starting. I really can’t. 

Much like Morata hit a ceiling, i think McKennie is coming back down to earth. Giving Ramsey a run in that position again isn’t a bad idea. There’s so much more to say but the bottom line is we just weren’t good enough. 

Im not convinced by Pirlo either, but I still think we need patience. We’re not Palermo, 3 sackings in 3 seasons stinks of amateur club in crisis and it’s not clear to me who we could go out and get that’s better and fits the board’s vision. What we need to do is give Pirlo a proper midfield and see if this style is gonna stick. Worthless to judge a manager trying to instill a possession based attacking style when he’s depending on Bentancur, Rabiot and friends to create. 

The 100 million dollar man didn’t do nearly enough today, sorry if that hurts to hear. Yes the team around him isn’t good but he wasn’t good either. If he was out there creating easy chances that were missed, or getting by players easily I’d understand the whole “do you want him to do everything?” thing, I don’t want him to everything, I want him to do SOMETHING. What did he do today? Close to nothing.

Bentancur, Rabiot(much less) and Kulusevski - The chokers, these players felt the pressure. You could notice this in Chiesa too but he is a hustler, he never stops trying so he got the goal.

Alex Sandro, Danilo, Chiellini - these players lack TECHNIQUE, they just suck at football (with the ball). Chiellini is a great player and has always been bad with the ball, but today he was off his game. Alex Sandro is just so shit I can't put it into words, he delivered a nice (obvious) pass for the goal, but his output is awful, too slow, bad first touches, too one footed, bad attacking awareness, bad on the go solutions. He is limited to the core. Danilo has always been shit, but his defending has been good even if somewhat aggresive.

Sczezny - had a bad day as far as I am concerned, countless bad passes and could have done better on the second goal.

Ramsey was good enough

Ronaldo was eh enough even if somewhat limited at 3 occasions where he gave the ball away

Morata was eeh too

I think we'll be able to win this match in the second leg, but there has to be some serious questions asked about the cohesion that this team does not have and why. 

I don't necessarily think Pirlo's tactical vision is wrong or ineffective, in my opinion it's a lot better than when Sarri or Allegri was here. He adjusts the team sheet and formation depending on the players and that's generally a good thing. His subs have generally been solid or again, at least an improvement over before. He attempts to play to the players strengths.

My concerns are with fundamentals. Things like basic mechanical skill, passing, off the ball play, crossing, etc. There's been more than a few games this season where our players have been utterly terrible at making decisions and passing under pressure at the back, as well as the same at the front.

If you compare Juventus in this regard to a team based in technical skill, the difference is so staggering that it's embarrassing, especially considering Juve doesn't really make up for it in any other regard. Players like Arthur cover up for a lack of it, but it seems like it's a training ground issue.

This is where I think Pirlo is failing to compensate. There's been just enough positive results that there's no focus on it, but it's the root of this Juventus squad's issue and needs to be dealt with. 

Porto was good, and we need to be a lot better in the 2nd leg to advance.",gnte2x8,lm5t97,Juve,2021-02-18 06:14:14,jbogs7,2
"Call me old-fashioned but I don't think it's a good idea wait until the last 15 minutes to actually start playing well. The no penalty call was controversial, but it shouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. We shouldn't be at the mercy of a bad referee call against a team like Porto (or any team for that matter). We should have taken control of the match from beginning, but we were just so demoralized after gifting away those 2 goals that we didn't get moving until 80 minutes in.

Chiesa is running like a madman for that i like him a lot, Rabiot is also good at keeping his calm in whatever situation and did 2 amazing runs behind the RB. Those the only 2 i remembered from this game.

"That was an awful ""stop"" by the ref.

He literally stopped it during the attack. There was a foul in the 4 minutes of stoppage time and I believe a sub so that 4 should've been closer to 5.

Then he stops it at 4 on the dot while the ball is being crossed. It seems like it's because of the VAR penalty and then he's just like ""na"" even though that VAR took place before the 4th minute.

"Honestly, I’ve been really disappointed with the attackers since the start of the year.

Firstly, I’ve been really disappointed with Morata ever since he missed that back heel goal. I didn’t really mind that he missed that one, but his decisions since then have been terrible. Can’t pass, can’t shoot, just shite.

Ronaldo has been much the same. Poor shooting, poor passing (except that assist), gets way too selfish on the ball. I’ve seen him complete one successful run this year (against inter)

And then we get to berna. Don’t get me fucking started

Also, criticism for kulu has been stupid. He’s been played out of position all year. People forget that he’s not actually a forward. He’s a midfielder who sometimes plays a supporting role in the right wing. Give him a break. 

I’d like to add benta and his play this year as well. I think he’s been expected to be a creative player, which he is not. He’s a defensive midfielder who should be defending more than attacking. Used as someone who collects the ball from out back, passes it to someone who then takes it forward. That said he shouldn’t be starting and should be mostly used as a sub to see out the game. His mistakes this year have been shocking.",gndrzeq,ljkpb7,Juve,2021-02-14 18:00:47,_ForzaJuve_,34

This was a typical 0-0 game, except for an unlucky foul. Not sure what Pirlo's initial plan was, but the amount of backpasses and sidepasses was too high.

"i thought the double pivot actually worked defensively today, and they provided forward balls just fine, especially Rabiot who was all over the field (Bull shit yellow btw) Juve created slightly over 2 expected goals compared to Napoli’s 1 (which was like 80% because of the penalty) https://understat.com/match/15640

So yes I know stats aren’t everything, but if you watched the game, wouldn’t you admit that Bentancur and Rabiot had nothing to do with Chiellini giving away a pen on a nothing ball that Szczesny had? And wouldn’t you admit Rabiot and Bentancur had nothing to do with Morata, Chiesa and Ronaldo missing shots/ Meret making great timely saves? 

Juve wasn’t perfect but we win this game 9/10 if we played again. Not to complain as I love all Juventini but it feels like when we lose and don’t score the midfield is promptly shit on. Every time. Like yeah they have their bad moments, but to put all the blame on them I feel is too easy this game. we didn’t concede because of back passes, we didn’t not score because of back passes. it’s a good thing to hold possession. we had double the xg of the other team. our veteran leader gave away a silly pen. these little mistakes happen over the course of the season.",gna8xuo,lj6qr6,Juve,2021-02-14 04:33:59,torontomaplebros,24

"Ok Pirlo, its time. I've been backing you all this time but that's it. Putting Bernadeschi in an important matches show your lack of experience. Subs him at 60 min after a thrash performance in the first half shows your lack of Iq. Do you hope him to turn into De Bruyne in the 2nd half? You aldy waste 1st half with 0 chance created, lets waste another 15 minutes. When you saw your Midfielder keep pass the ball back for 30 minutes you should've yell at them, scold them, push them or something but you just watch. Gattuso have bigger balls than you.

"Ronaldo and Chielleni lost us this game. Our two veterans put on a disaster class on both sides of the pitch. I really expected more from Cristiano today. Chiesa, Danilo and De Ligt were the only good ones today. We need to start playing Danilo and Chiesa/Cuadrado on the right and McKennie on the left. No more Cuadrado right back, play him either as a winger or a right midfielder. Ronaldo needs to step up his form.

Honestly it’s not just the coaching you don’t have the right players.  They don’t fit together properly the passing in the the other teams half is terrible.  Too scared too make risky passes and create something.  They just suck.  Ronaldo can’t even get into the game properly. If he’s looking for a champions league run this is not the team to do it with he should be gone in the summer hopefully back to Manchester.,gnaekm3,lj6qr6,Juve,2021-02-14 04:56:37,richiebeans123,-3
Losing before the cl game is demoralising. Specially when u beat inter in the last match. This loss is on Pirlo to change the formation.

"Likely wouldn't have changed the result but the ref was blowing every time one of our players breathed too close to a Napoli player, and also didn't tell Lozano or Meret to piss off when they were blatantly faking injuries to wast time. 

As for us well we slowed down the play far too often which allowed them to get every man and their dog behind the ball and prevent us from getting a good ball in. Needed a lot more pace on the counters. 

If we react well to this and don't let this be the start of a losing streak then we might still be in with a shot at the title, Inter and Milan aren't gonna win every game from now until the end of the season.

Apart from that he made a solid match but nothing to be so much excited about, pretty standard performance for this level.

Everyone is praising de ligt and Demiral, for good reason here and there. But that first goal is so easy to work around, I’ve seen so many mistakes by the defense; and I truly don’t trust them two lining up together. I feel so much more comfortable with chiellini in the middle. They’re just too young.. 

Midfield performance I also found lackluster, mckennie didn’t have that same spark as usual, seeing the rat and benta play together was like watching bambi on ice.. they were slipping and losing possession. 

Really not impressed with Alex Sandro either, but I really don’t know how many years I’ve been saying that.

Ronaldo did his job, before fading into obscurity like the few last matches.

I’m usually such a big fan of Kulusevski, but man.. he brought absolutely nothing to the table today..

"Regardless of how you became a fan of La Vecchia Signora, welcome! I became a fan after seeing Del Piero's performances for Italy when I was young. I don't see that as much different than with you and Ronaldo.

"First off, welcome. You're not a fanboy if you stay being a Juventino! These are a few Juve insights for you:

1. Juventus has one of  the longest reigning ownerships in Italian football, with the Agnelli family. Extremely rich family who is famously known for Fiat. 


2. Due to calcio success and Fiat, Juventus became and still is both the most loved and most hated club in Italy.


3. Juventus made 3 CL finals in a row; 95-98.


4. All 4 of Italy's World Cup have had heavily influenced Juventus contingents critical for success. 


5. The 2006 World Cup final between Italy and France had almost the entire Juventus lineup taking part at some point during the game. 


6. Deep history with the best of the best French talent with Platini, Zidane, Deschamps, Thuram, Trezequet.


7. Juventus in the overall historical UEFA club rankings Juventus is ranked 5, which is above both Milan and Liverpool who, yes, both have many more Champion League titles. Reason being is that Juventus has consistently done well and have been unlucky in CL final losses.


8. So many CL losses. The most in fact.


9. Unique club name in consideration of all of European football. ""Juventus"" is of course of Latin origin for etymology and means of youth. Cool and different.


10. One of the best, young owners around in Andrea Agnelli. He's a leader among his peers.


11. Juventus has double the number of titles (38) as the next highest (Milan and Inter both have 18 and 17 I believe).


E. 12. Grinta! Fino alla fine. Juventus has a clear and deliberate calcio philosophy and identity. We're serious. We like guys the Nedved, David, Chiellini, Montero, Bentancur, Deschamps, Tevez, Di Livio, Cuadrado, Marchisio, etc types. Hard workers.",glm4fac,la51l4,Juve,2021-02-02 00:13:11,Tre10Quartista,41

I've seen juve lose in 2 cl finals and witness the horror show that was the del neri era. My favorite players have to be del.piero and marchisio. Imo they were the definition of juventini and they were this club. Never bigger than the club itself and I feel like that's something that always stays true at this club.

"Originally, Juventus played in [pink shirts with a black tie](https://kids.kiddle.co/images/thumb/8/89/Sport-Club_Juventus_1897-1898.jpg/654px-Sport-Club_Juventus_1897-1898.jpg). The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the color so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a color that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts (Notts County replicas) to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colors to be aggressive and powerful.

Some Juventus nickname:

* **I Bianconeri** (The Black and Whites) and **Le Zebre** (The Zebras): Juventus iconic color.

* **La Vecchia Signora** (The Old Lady): The ""old"" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means ""youth"" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The ""lady"" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. Over the years, there are other derived nickname like **La Signora Omicidi** (The Killer Lady) and **La Madama** (Madam).

* **La Fidanzata d'Italia** (The Girlfriend of Italy): Because Juventus has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s.

* **La Gheuba** (The Hunchback): Dates back to the fifties, when Juventus players wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.

"Welcome to the club, then. Regardless of the reasons you started supporting Juventus, the fact that you're here asking these questions shows your interest.

I've been a fan since I was little. I am pretty sure the first memories I have are from season 2000/01 because I remember Van der Sar as a GK. 

As others have stated, we are unfortunately the team with the most UCL final lost, but our history has been always filled with great moments to remember. Personally, Del Piero is the one and only player I loved with all my heart, so I'd suggest you to check out some of his plays and goals, in particular the goal v Fiorentina in 1994, the one v Piacenza in 2003, the one v Zenit in 2008, the first one in UCL after Calciopoli. 
 
I don't think I've seen it mentioned, but in the summer of 2006, Juventus was found guilty of fixing matches and got stripped of two titles and relegated in the second division (for the first time ever). Del Piero, Buffon, Chiellini, Trezeguet, Nedved and Camoranesi (three of them as World Champions) were the only starting players of the previous season that decided to stay, and have a special place in every juventino's heart.

My top 3 matches that I remember are:  
\- Juventus 3-1 Real Madrid, 2002-03 UCL Semi Final (second leg)  
\- Juventus 3-0 Barcelona, 2016-17 UCL Quarter Final (first leg)  
\- Inter 2-3 Juventus, 2017-18 Serie A (likely the title winning match)

My suggestion is simple: watch matches and follow the competitions. Many of the emotions I have felt in my life when it comes about Juventus are not easy to describe or to explain because they're the result of weeks, months or years building up expectations and hopes.

"Welcome to the ""club"" fellow Juventino! (Pun intended)

I've been a Juve fan since '95 when i was 7 and our biggest rival was Parma, those years :)

For milestones look at the title race in '98. Del Piero vs. The real Ronaldo. The game which gives Inter fans night terros even today.

Look at Del Piero's standing ovation at the Bernabeu.

Del Piero's emphatic back heel vs. Dortmund in thr CL final.

Yeah, obviously i am a Del Piero fan :))

Look at the seria B and pre-Angeli years. Painful, yet defining of us and our Finno alla fine attitude. And the reason we will always love Del Piero, Nedved, Camoranesi, Chielini, Buffon. 

""A true gentlmen never leaves his Lady""

From here stems the modern Juve mentality, the pleasure of destroying the other teams for 9 years, and the hate for inter.

"They bought Ronaldo to grow their brand and earning power off the pitch. On the pitch he was brought in to paper over the holes in the team and ostensibly to  “lead Juve to a CL title” but mostly (imo) to paper over holes in the team and make a big marketing splash.

Ronaldo has been brilliant, exactly 100% as advertised. However the board was far too confident in existing roster and significantly overrated the impact many transfers would have (think about rabiot ramsey Demiral etc, not de Ligt). 

When he arrived the defense was aging and needed replacing, so far de Ligt is the only real help they’ve gotten in that aspect. When Ronaldo arrived the midfield was in shambles, the board has succeeded in making them younger but they’ve all struggled mightily with fitness and form. They simply are not good enough.

Ronaldo gets all the blame for the losses and all the credit for the wins, which comes with the territory but this “project” was doomed to failure from the start no matter how brilliantly Ronaldo performed.",gsp5eh5,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-29 23:47:02,jarpio,71
"I’ve never been a huge Ronaldo fan. I mean - I always knew he and Messi were the best and would make a difference on the field - however, I never really followed him that regularly to build a reasonable opinion on him before he joined us. 

After he did I of course started seeing him every week and I must admit that the quality he brings to the field is incredible. This man has a discipline, persistence, professionalism that is likely unmatched nowadays. In addition to that he has a winning mentality, just like the one we always saw at Juve in the glory days. 

Now - while I really respect and do love him as a player now - I gotta admit that for us, for the team and time, it might’ve been not the right decision to sign him. From a marketing point of view of course It did. But I am speaking for the pitch. And it’s not his fault either. 

Our management back then seemed to be convinced that we were missing one final piece to glory (winning the ucl) and thus signed the one player who can call himself Mr Champions League. However, we bought the possibly best striker ever, but neglected the fact that our other departments- especially the midfield - was lacking A LOT of quality. At Real Madrid he had a top quality midfield behind him - at Juve we have been missing this since 2015. 

Nevertheless he was able to score a lot of goals - of course he did - but we underachieved in my opinion as a team. And I stand with my opinion - even though 75% of the sub here would like a new coach ever Sunday - that this is a problem that originated in our management office, where wrong decisions have been made. 

To finalize, I am thankful to Ronald and glad we had the honor to have him in our team, but speaking for the team and our ambitions- i think it would be best to move forward this summer.",gsp3ujw,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-29 23:35:05,el_guerrero23,55
"He's been very good as expected, but I've felt that in some games we play specifically for Ronaldo to score and not precisely for the team to win (specially in his 1st season), idk how to describe it. I'd say that overall his influence has been good, but there's even more pressure in the team because he's at the end of his career and well, we don't have a UCL winning team atm.",gspp6la,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-30 02:16:37,R-leiva97,7
"He definitely disrupted the balance of the team. Basically ruined Higuain's career. We haven't had a single player as a team focus since Baggio and this came a bit abruptly. 

Influence - should be positive in terms of his personality of a serial winner. 

Do you feel that Juventus limit Ronaldo or Ronaldo limits Juventus?  Both. We seem unable to provide Ronaldo with the same teammates that he had in Madrid. Ronaldo limits us with his large financial demands and the fact that he requires to be the focus.

But Ronaldo's signing was never about any of these things. It was above all about brand recognition. Management saw the opportunity to sign this generation's best player (or one of two) who's also the most popular sportsperson in the world. An opportunity like this comes once a decade. So it can never be a bad decision in this sense.",gsp4lso,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-29 23:40:55,WW_Jones,14
"Hey. Juve fan since 2003. He has influenced the dynamic tremendously to be slightly more attacking than usual. Or at least thats been the theory behind it. The truth is that its caused the team dynamics to be a bit lopsided. Because of his exorbitant salary, Juve have bet on the wrong free transfers and havent had the cash to spend on some decent supporting cast. Despite that, he has delivered for Juve more often than not. I don't think the Juve limits Ronaldo or Ronaldo limits Juve is a fair question to ask. Thats like asking you as an RM fan if he carried the team or the team carried him.",gspn2a7,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-30 02:00:42,neil_ny,4
It’s more about the financials. Juve last 4-5 years have done some poor things financially including Ronaldo’s contract. They were naive to disregard all the players that left and clear regression from who they still kept from the great mid 2010s juve teams. If covid wasn’t a thing I’m sure juve would actually get a good midfield and shore up some other spots,gsp2t1i,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-29 23:26:55,Trick_Confidence_419,3
"Now that I look back on it, it was pretty much to grow the brand. I was happy that Juve got him, after him and Madrid destroyed Juve the previous seasons champions league quarter finals. At the time I honestly thought CR7 could help Juve reach the champions league finals but it was always to be on borrowed time due to his age and each year we got eliminated (ajax, Lyon, Porto) the chances to reach the promise land were getting slimmer and slimmer.",gspwkdr,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-30 03:12:35,j0Nburke,3
"When he is in form he is incredibly dangerous in front of the net. Sometimes he's able to win games for us through shear willpower when our team has decided that a tie is good enough. Also, I think his name alone made Juve more desirable for great players to come here. I seriously doubt we would have been able to attract de Ligt or Arthur without his presence on are team. 



On the negative side, he does limit our team both financially and on the field. His wages are outrageous and it makes it difficult to afford quality players in positions where we are lacking. On the field I think he might have made our players lazy because they rely too heavily on Ronaldo. They basically assume that Ronaldo will eventually score and they can make wastful passes and think that Ronaldo is good enough to fetch it. Ronaldo is great, but he's only one man. 




I'm a long time Juve fan, and I actually hated Ronaldo before he came here, but overall I think he has been a net positive for Juve.",gsrb5xw,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-30 10:18:02,ladygagafan1237,3

"Ronaldo pigeonholes your tactics. 

At a glacticos club like RM - excellent idea.  Put you stars on the pitch at let them perform.

At a tactics based club like Juve where defense wins championships - terrible idea.  We haven't had the defense we had even three seasons ago and leaking goals is why we no longer top the table.

Ronaldo certainly is excellent at scoring goals, but volume doesn't matter as much as where/when you place them.  It doesn't matter if you can bang it a hat trick against Benevento if you can't score one against Porto.

People act like Juve never scored goals before Ronaldo.  It was just a team effort with no one player putting in the lions share.  Is he a good player, sure, but he isn't what we ever needed and I'll be glad to see him go.

Inb4 thanks for the downvotes...

He isn't fearsome as he used to be if I am totally honest, the player succed in term of personal records but as a project failed misserebly, if I went back on time I would either don't sign him at all and keep on with dybala higuain mandzukic or either sign him and also splash another 200 million on the midfeild and defence which we all know, we are not Chelsea or city. It's a pleasure to see Mr Goat at our team eventhough he isn't at his peak now days but can't really put blame on him, in the time of carrer he needs all support around him, he gets least ammount of support from the other players around him in his whole carrer including his lispon times.",gsqa5ny,mfrptj,Juve,2021-03-30 04:57:04,Anashisham,1

"After all the crazy schedule Juve had, we finally get the rest we need before facing Benevento (next Sunday) and Torino (April 3th).

I consider this to be vital because it's where the whole team should focus 100% on winning every match ahead no matter what. No mistakes allowed here (like dropping points at the start of the season).

We have some matches decently distributed (7 day resting period in between), except for May:

- 02/05: vs Udinese 
- 09/05: vs Milan
- 12/05: vs Sassuolo
- 16/05: vs Inter
- 19/05: vs Atalanta (Coppa Italia Final)
- 23/05: vs Bologna 

Considering all the shit we've been through in January and February, these last matches shouldn't be a problem for us. 

I do expect Inter to drop points (against Sassuolo, Napoli, Roma and especially us), but in order to increase our chances of achieving our 10th scudetto, we need to **keep winning** every match. A team like Juve shouldn't depend on others failure to obtain success.

"Inter will drop some points, but the problem is we surely not gonna win all our matches. I doubt we will even manage to beat them, plus we have Napoli and Milan to face too.

"I don't know if someone mentioned it already, but what applies first if the 2 teams are tied in points is their direct encounter result, which the 💩 won 0-2 in Milano. Either we have to win by 3-0 in Turin, get more points than them after 38 matchdays or win by 2-0 and have a better goal difference whilst both teams being on par as far as total points are concerned. I stand to be corrected on the last point.

With the way things are shaping up it looks to be their year. 1 game in 1 week, conte has many defects but this is his forte. 

Whatever happens we must push till the end, apply all the pressure possible on them, it's the least that we could do, being Juventus requires fighting for each point, us fans deserve nothing less except warriors showing fino alla fine until the referee whistles the end of the match in the 90th minute at Bologna.

"&gt;**These scenarios require Inter to screw up at least 3 matches, which in their current form is pretty tough, although the Torino match shows they can screw up.** 

We thought the same after the Parma game, then they beat Atalanta and Torino 5minutes before end. We got more hard games than them, more games to play (Napoli in Serie A and Atalanta in Coppa Italia), more injuries and also in our game vs Inter we probably gonna start with a draw being a loss and have to win. It's extremely unlikely that we win the league, I would stop on calculating those dozens scenarios and focus on securing the 2nd spot and winning Coppa Italia",gqzvoyj,m5d5bn,Juve,2021-03-15 17:31:42,nctx,3

Juventus can win this. Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face with reality. This has been a spectacular year for unexpected results. And Juventus is a champion, that means they will not give up.

Inter could easily lose points with a mistake and a team defending with everything they have. Players can lose focus. Its a day to day and for anyone thinking its all over.

Also Inter will drop this out. They maybe have Conte but they dont have winning mentality under pressure. Just remember their Shaktar game in CL. They still dont feel real pressure from us. When we start breathing by their neck they will start droping points.

I would actually just focus on us and reallisticly I think that if we draw one and win the rest of the games, Scudetto is ours.

It's ok, guys. Man up and admit you were wrong and all will be forgiven. Pirlo knows what he's doing. Posters on r/Juve definitely do not.

You may not like Pirlo because he's not the guy you wanted. But he's here, and he's not going anywhere. The players love him, management loves him.

"I plan on posting this on Tactics Tuesday, but wanted to comment here on potential formations going forward. I wonder if Pilo will ever explore a 4-3-3. The following is a formation and “depth chart”:

GK: Sir Chesney/Buffon 

RB: Cuadrado/Frabotta

CB: Leo B/Demiral/Sandro

CB: DeLigt/Chiellini/Sandro

LB: Bernadeschi/Frabotta/Sandro

RM: Arthur/Mckinnie/Kulu

CDM: Danilo/Arthur/Fagiloi

LM: Rabiot/Ramsey/Berna/Bentacur

LW: CR7/Chiesa/Kulu/Dybala

ST: Moratta/CR7

RW: Chiesa/Dybala

Defence: 
Demiral is an energetic player, but mistake prone. A backup role seems fitting for a role he can grow from. Bonnucci is mistake prone as well... but to a lesser extent. He’s got a calmer head and his passing ability is valuable. He’s a confidence player, so coaches should gauge where he is at constantly. Berna has been a revelation at LB. He will have to get better defensively, which will come through experience. His ability going forward is valuable. Sandro looks tired going forward but has filled in well with spot CB duty. 

Midfield:
Danilo has played very calmly and tidily as CDM and Pirlo should let him embrace the role. A 3-man midfield fits his “philosophy” and two midfielders can push up with proper CDM behind them. Obviously midfield will have to be rotated for freshness, so I’d like to see Fagioli and McKinnie play plenty. 

Forwards: 
pretty straightforward, pun fully intended. CR7, Moratta, and Ronaldo make up the best forward line. To keep freshness, rotation is necessary and Dybala is an unknown variable. We know his quality and it’s interesting to see what he can bring. I believe Kulu should be a reserve and grow in that capacity. Moratta is a confidence player, so rotation and depth in the forward position, especially center forward, is a must. 


Obviously, I’m a fan, not a coach. Pirlo has a genius football playing mind and we hope it translates to managing. But this is my observation and opinion and it would be cool to see in action.",gqxto2u,m51edr,Juve,2021-03-15 04:31:07,[deleted],2

"People are extremely shortsighted and super ignorant when it comes to football, 99% of Ronaldo's plastic fans have no idea that Real Madrid didn't win the Champions league since 2002 until they got it again in 2014, and that the perfect 3 years streak was because of a perfectly balanced over-powerd team, where the weakest element was always the CB next to Ramos, while in every other position they had pure world class players, these are the idiots who blame's Juve for ""Ronaldo's failure"". 

&amp;nbsp;

Moving on to our idiots now, those who only play FIFA and got delusional by our PES-in-medium mode 9 years run in serie-A, thinking that Ronaldo can single-handedly win us the 2nd hardest competition in Football, I always laugh when people fall for the marketing and Disney-script of ""Ronaldo eliminated Atletico with a legendary hattrick"" when in reality that was one of the best team-effort Juve have put this decade, we played **as a team** and in order for Ronaldo to score, he needed to receive the ball, he didn't do it alone, he never did it alone, and no other player ever did it or will do it alone, not Ronaldo, not Messi, not Zidane, not Maradona, not Del Piero, not Totti, not Bale, not Lewandowski, **NO ONE**, otherwise the fifa worldcup final should have been shared between Ronaldo and Messi for the past 4 or 5 versions. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ronaldo is one of best finishers in the world, and definitely the best aerial finisher in the world, and he currently pose one single problem to this team and it's not even his fault, and that is a financial problem, the question is really simple: 

* Is Juve capable of re-enforcing our squad with world class midfielders and a left back **while keeping Ronaldo's wages** ? 

If yes, then he most definitely need to stay, but if that's not possible, then sell him while we can, period.

"Unless theres a war chest of 500m+ the overhaul isnt happening. 

At this point, start looking beyond Ronaldo. Its been a nice luxury but ultimately the project isnt working. He helped grow the brand, he got a few titles. 

Ronaldo doesnt get the service he needs 90% of the time, nor does the team share his relentless passion and desire to win. Hell, 90% of the time the team refuses to make a forward pass. 

Move him on, put all your attention into getting Haaland and a midfield that actually plays attacking (not sideways) football. Haaland and Morata as your forward pair should be the goal.

Im indifferent as to whether Dybala should stay. He has huge market potential if we sell, but his performances on the pitch arent what we need them to be. Hes starting to remind me of Giacharinni or Giovinco with his stature and lack of physical ability.

Juve Jeep sponsorship since Ronaldo went from 16-51m a year and in the first few days of his arrival Juve sold $60m of cr7 jerseys. Since 2018 think of all the branding and sponsorship opportunities that have opened up to juve and even things like Juves Instagram being up to 47m, things like that have a positive economic impact. Saying all this, I can understand an argument saying to get rid of Ronaldo bc of how he plays and effects the team, specifically how other players have to compensate for his lack of movement/involvement on the pitch.

"I think people are being too harsh on CR7 and a bit too benevolent with Pirlo.
Cristiano wasn't the only one on the wall, so blaming him of everything would be exaggerated.
We can all agree that he wasn't relevant in the game, but don't forget that he has 27 goals in 32 matches, 29 of them starting the match. Second is Morata with 16 goals in 32 matches, 23 as a starter.
Atlético would have eliminated Juve if it wasn't for Cristiano.

Or what, Porto's goals in the first match were his fault, he did that bad pass for the first goal of Porto?

I'm not saying he has done nothing wrong, but not all is his fault. The team is tired, and there is no bench. The worst moment to get rid of the old players was this season that they are playing a lot in small periods of time.

And Juve needs a good GK, Szczesny was bad in Arsenal, in Roma, and i don't know whose brilliant idea was of bringing him instead of giving a chance to Perin or other GK. Buffon is still a better choice.

The team quality and depth has diminished. A lot of tactical and positioning issues, which should be worked in the training. The team defends without any order and sometimes they attack the same way too.

Pirlo is the first coach to lose the Calcio with Juve in 10 years. That's something very bad to begin with, not even Sarri, and he was terrible.
If he doesn't make any changes in these last months and next season, Pirlo must go.

And the way things are looking, when Cristiano leaves, Juve will have the same issues that Madrid is still facing right now.",gql0ir9,m2mmv1,Juve,2021-03-11 23:48:35,emilioshi_sama,0

"I can’t see him leaving this summer purely because we’ll never get a good price for him due to his being out of this side for almost the entire season. But in my opinion we need to offload him as soon as a good price is offered.

People on this sub have a STRONG tendency to treat injured players like they’re the best players in the world and Dybala is no different, how often do you see people in threads saying “we need Dybala right now,” those same people were saying we need Ramsey a few weeks ago. 

Anyway Dybala. He definitely he has the potential to be world class, one of the very best but 2 things majorly bring him down; his injury rate and his overall attitude on and off the pitch. The man is very arrogant, hence why contract negotiations haven’t gone smoothly with him, and several managers have reported that they don’t enjoy working with him, this attitude seems to also appear on the pitch. IMO he just doesn’t put enough work rate in if he doesn’t feel like it (which is too often). Very similar to Rabiot in that sense, except at least Dybala has insane talent when he does bother.

So do I wanna keep a player who’ll be out injured half the time and the other it be a gamble if he can be bothered to put the shift in on the pitch? No. Do I think we’ll keep him? Probably.",gqk6y0n,m2g1hy,Juve,2021-03-11 19:02:55,Wolf_Todd,0

I was already depressed because of the defeat and the negativity on this sub didn't help. It's always good to come across optimistic posts. 
I think next season we should try to sell Costa, bentancur and ramsey and get a world class creative midfielder or a CDM. Give pellegrini and berna more chances on the LB. On good days our midfield is pretty solid on good days for example bacra game when we completely dominate the midfield but we still need that creative player who can create something out of nothing. We should try dybala as CAM I think it would work out as he comes deep to receive the ball, can dribble through tight spaces and can pass really well.

With all this said I believe in pirlo and I am absolutely convinced that this club is moving in the right direction. People like to live in Nostalgia and have wet dreams about allegri and I am amazed by the fact that people still believe that sarri was good. Pirlo is definitely showing glimpse of good football and believe it or not there was a very big improvement from last year. All the big clubs apart form bayern and city are struggling and we are in a much better position than barca and real madrid tbh.

"Great write up!  


Some comments though.   


I really appreciate your writing about ""boring"" Allegri. I can get so annoyed at what people deem to be ""boring"" football. Playing proper football, being positionally and tactically aware, having a solid game-plan, playing to the best of the ability of the squad and/or eleven and not making mistakes because everyone knows their place within the system to isn't boring. It's a wonderful thing to see. Having great creative players who transcend systems and tactics is all good and well but isn't really what Juve have ever been about, and with the squad Juve currently have there isn't really the quality in the creative department to play like that. This is why Porto beat us, a well functioning team will almost always beat a team that, even though it might have better players, aren't playing like a proper team. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree with most of what you are saying about the midfield during the Allegri era, but Matuidi is a criminally underrated player imo. Sure, he often looked pretty horrid in possession but he actually more often than not accomplished great things while looking like stumbling forward. And I have to say I'd much rather have Matuidi (at the level he was at at the time, not saying he shouldn't have moved on since) than Ramsay or Rabiot. Being a supporting explosive box-to-box player together with Pjanic he was perfect in that role.   


Also I have to disagree with your assessment of Pjanic. He maybe didn't have the greatest last season at Juve but for for the most part of his Juve career I think he was near to being one of the best players in his position in Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Totally agree about Rabiot and Ramsey. We probably got a bit lucky with signing Pogba and Coman for free, they were both good deals but trying to replicate that with Rabiot and Ramsey obviously hasn't worked.   


There are some positives from this season thus far, most notably Chiesa, but I'm also pretty worried for the future as I'm not completely convinced there is a proper plan for the development of the squad.",gr0kueo,m20gqg,Juve,2021-03-15 22:34:26,ormishen,2

"In order to compete with the likes of bayern munich or psg additional players are needed, one or two fullbacks, a defensive midfielder, etc.  The team mentality has to change, today everyone plays a couple of touches before passing.

"Excellent analysis, overall it still felt like a mistake by Agnelli, Nedved and Paratici. They brought in Ronaldo without recognising that the team was already in decline. Max Allergi had alerted the management to revolutionise the squad but his request were not considered. Everyone blasted him for the poor and dire playing style in his last season but what is he really expected to do with such unbalanced resources? He had already shown that he was able to continue winning despite seeing key players depart on a yearly basis (Tevez, Vidal, Pogba, Pirlo, just to name a few...) 

Then now we are in a real rebuild mode this season but the process started late and also begs the question of why we bring in Ronaldo and enter a rebuild mode?

We had Pirlo, Vidal, Pogba, and Marchisio all providing some sort of creativity allowing us to build up down the center.

Also disappointing we had like almost 70 percent possession and couldn't do much against 10 men which goes back to our sub-par midfield play. Pretty bad from us. I am hopeful for the future though. Lot of young talent. Man sucks our midfield never worked out with Ronaldo here. Like Ronaldo feasted with his RM midfield who were amazing at creating chances and he ends up coming to a stagnate midfield who falters in major cup matches because of higher level press exposes them out than in say a league game and still amazing he was able to create enough to be prolific without the same support he had at RM.",gqlamis,m20gqg,Juve,2021-03-12 01:03:02,redblade13,1

The players a club has are tools. How those tools are used and to what effect is the job of the management. Our management is failing so they are failing.

In Ronaldo we have a lethal weapon that turns out we cannot make great use of for whatever reason. Be it our way of play, strategy, type of players and so on.

I'm gonna state this again. The problem with Sarri and now Pirlo is that they are stubborn beyond belief. You need to play to win and adjust to the tactics to best suit the players you have in your disposal. You cannot force players into something that it will never work. You'll just be doomed to fail.

"I agree with some of your points, but you also have to consider that a big part of the flop is Juves directors not getting players to complement a 36 year old Ronaldo. Instead of speedy wingers ( see the success of Chiesa), Ronaldo has to drop deep because Kulusevksi is not a real  winger, Dybala is injured 90% of the time, Morata is only good at rare times, and no one else is there in the attack. The midfield is STERILE. That is the biggest takeaway fom this season. There is absolutely no creativity. Ramsey is not creative. Rabiot is not creative. Bentancur and Arthur are good at distributing passes in the back but that's their full exetent. Mckennie is a Gattuso type player. Ronaldo succceeded at Real cause he had players like Modric and Benzema who opened up so many spaces for him. Juve simply don't have that. The only player capable of that is Dybala. 

Maybe it is time to let him go, but i still believe a big part of failure is due to the lack of coaching experience and not getting the complementary pieces!",gqfdj9p,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 16:35:43,georgedavidrs,87
"The main problem is having ronaldo means that he has to play all the time, but he doesnt stick to position when he plays and goes wide, which causes problems in the build up play, but when ronaldo was rested vs lazio the team was able to play with a 4231 and do well eventhough they didnt have much time to adapt to the formation. I feel like the more ronaldo stays the less he fits in the team, parting ways would be beneficial for both sides, juventus would be able to grow into a 4231 and ronaldo could join a team that is already built really well e.g. PSG",gqfdued,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 16:40:51,TheKxcvm,19
"Ah after everytime game we lose . You can see the same post .
I dont think Cristiano ronaldo signing wasn't for taking us to a next level in ucl .
You don't play with a regressed af midfield or hire a coach with literally 0 experience if you want immediate success .

Project ronaldo is more about using him as a bandaid to cover up our big wounds and keep us in track .
Ronaldo had scored 6/8 of our k.o in ucl . Ronaldo has scored most points in europe since joining us , ronaldo has won most points , most goals for us sonce joining , most assists for us since joining ,most key pass , most dribbles , most shot creation etc since joining us .

Project Ronaldo is a success ! But You don't win ucl like this .  You dont win when all you do is play horizontal passes with no creativity from the midfield . We are very predictable.
We have an inexistent midfield for 3-4 years now . Its getting better and we are under rebuild .

"I somehow understand the perspective of blaming the man with the highest expectations after an unsuccessful match. However, I don't agree with it. Why are you after the 36-year-old, which scores a shit load of goals during a season, and not the system behind it that could potentially make him score even more? And by system I mean managers, directors, coach that should make an extraordinary team with Juve's finance, by bringing and arranging valuable players in all compartments, not only one star and presume that is all it takes to win trophies. Why waren't better players bought in front of the keeper seeing how miserable the defence has been the last couple of years? Why wasn't a real high class playmaker brought to the team? Why wasn't an experienced coach offered? One with proven background in managing the transition of generations but that is also able to win trophies? Too many experiments were performed this year, something that is not typical for Juve's history. Who is the direct man to blame for last night only? Maybe Pirlo. Maybe Demiral. Maybe the whole defence. Maybe Morata, who had 2-3 clear chances to score. Yes, Ronaldo had a bad day, but I wouldn't say he is the first to blame last night. And let's face it, Ronaldo wasn't bought at the end of his career for Juve to win in Europe, as you state in your last argument. Otherwise, other world class players would have been transferred.

"I don’t think the problem is Ronaldo himself, a top club like Juve should be able to win against Porto even when its best player is not in shape.
Yesterday’s result had been just one of the last steps of a decline started after Cardiff. Juve board paralysed the club by spending a huge amount of financial resources on players that were not worth it and if you add the pandemic things can only go worse.

So what about the future?
Juve must turn the page, we should start a long sight project, focusing on our coach, our young talents and some reliable and loyal players.",gqfrg5d,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 20:09:21,furish,2
"I see where you are comming from, but I don't agree. This team has gotten worse over those 3 years, especially the defence. The only players who are consistenly good are Ronaldo, De Ligt, Sczeszny, Cuadrado and Dybala (when he is not injured). All otger players declined and either left the club or comtinued to dissappoint. Chiesa is great, but he is not ebough to cover the what we lost. The defence may be decent in terms of goals conceded, but it doesn't matter if you concede 1 almost every match and concede in every key game... 

When Ronaldo came, Juventus already lost Pirlo-Pogba-Vidal and was struggling, BBC was already old and they became even older. Bernardeschi also declined. And despite all of that, he carried this team in the league and won 2 titles with Juventus, and he also carried Juventus 2 seasons in UCL, but the team let his efforts go to waste. He is still great in the league (he is a top scorer). Against Porto he didn't do much, but he got an assist, he wasn't completely useless.

When you see those things, it is not right to blame him the most and call for his departure.",gqg1amw,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 21:53:53,SindraGan2001,2
"Ronaldo did what he could, and can still be a huge factor in helping Juve win trophies. The problem is the team. You can’t say that any of these players can be starters in a team like PSG, Bayern, Man city, and some of the other heavyweights. Morata isn’t consistent enough. I’d put him below Benzema. I like Chiesa, and I feel like we would be better fit to compliment Ronaldo like Benzema did at Real. Besides De Ligt, Arthur, and perhaps Rabiot, they don’t have wingers,midfielders, or def that would be starters on another title contending teams in Europe. They average and maybe slightly above average at best.

Bentancours defensive error which changed the tie. 

Porto’s brilliant plan of completely putting CR7 out of the game and leave Morata alone counting on his ability to choke in big games. Excellently executed. 

Lack of players signed which compliment CR7. 

Assigning a coach before he literally got his license to manage a football club.

"Pirlo should have subbed him off last night. I think the team plays like a team when he isn’t on the field, and although it’s a mediocre team, it would have been much better. That was Ronaldo’s worst performance for us, he was dead weight.

For the past few games, if you watch his body language, it seems like he doesn’t really want to be there. And last night there was zero hunger from him. I am not a big fan of his but he has pulled us out of some dire situations.

We can’t rely on that though. We can’t build a team 1. Because of how much he costs. 2. Because he is getting older. Also when he does play every pass has to go to him. The team plays for Ronaldo and not the other way around. He often makes the “wrong” choices around the box. In his prime he’d score 90% of those and he’d be on nearly 50 goals this season. But he’s not in his prime anymore.

It’s not his fault, but I do think it’s time for him to go. With the savings on his salary alone we can bring in a couple of decent young players.",gqff643,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 17:02:47,artoftheescape,4
"I agree with some of your points, but this is what I think.. 

Just like you said, when we got Ronaldo we were hoping that once he would step his game up, the team would follow and we would go strong. The example of this was our second game vs Atletico, where he scored a hat trick and we won. Ronaldo is in the list of top 5 players to ever exist, but just like the other 4, they needed some type of support.

In my opinion, the failure has not been Ronaldo, its been Andrea Agnelli, Fabio Paratici and Pavel Nedved. They have found a way to make our midfield get worse and worse and expect ronaldo to make up for their mistakes. Unfortunately, he is the owner of the team and probably wont resign his presidency, but best believe it would be for the greater good

Edit: oh my god and I don’t even want to get started on Morata, it honestly amazes me how he is still playing on a competitive level, and how we were the fucking morons to GET HIM AGAIN AFTER HE DIDNT WORK THE FIRST TIME",gqfp4d4,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 19:38:14,Wutangprophet,2

For all we know, a front 3 of Morata-Kulu-Chiesa (just spitballing to make a point here) could be a weapon of mass destruction, but we'll never know because Ronaldo has to play, and he has to play the position he wants, and his attacking partners should suit him. As long as he's here we won't grow as a team, no wonder Real let him go first thing when they realized it was time for a rebuild.",gqfphyo,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 19:43:26,tigull,2

"I dont think Ronaldo is the main problem, but he is part of the problem. Yes, the Juve board have made some very dodgy signings that was not up to par with what Ronaldo needs to be effective. I dont know what Juve thought but buying Ronaldo was guaranteeing you anything when quite literally, Real Madrid had a top 5 to Top 3 player in every position in the world, and thats not even including the bench they had. Juve didnt even have players with a fraction of the quality Real had. 

Second thing, building the team around Ronaldo opposed to Dybala was a crucial error in my eyes. As the reasons stated above, but Ronaldo should have been brought in to compliment Dybala's abilities opposed to just having Ronaldo be at the end of everything. Dybala was thriving before Ronaldo's arrival, and really has been a shell of his former self since he has arrived. Dybala is that type of player that needs to be the focal point of the teams offence instead of being part of it. He is far more well rounded offensively than Ronaldo in the last three years of their career.

Three, truth is, as great as Ronaldo is, he is not going to provide you with the same level of effectivity in the final third outside of goal scoring. He is not a constant nuisance to defenses in ways Messi, Neymar, Mbappe are. He is not an effective dribbler, he is not an effective playmaker. Not saying he doesnt have his moments, but realistically he is not going to get that for you on a consistent basis, but you can rely on his goalscoring ability, only if the service is of quality.

Just my take, by Juve have put Dybala aside for Ronaldo thinking he would replicate what he did at Real.",gqm3u19,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-12 04:33:48,Uyemaz,1
"As someone who watches Ronaldo a lot (back in Real), he doesn't do well against annoying teams. At Real, his most disappointing games would be against Onana where he would have a million shots on target and all of them saved by a player at God level. Pepe did that today. If Ronaldo is covered the entire game, and the mid isn't gonna pass to him or open the game in a creative way, he won't score. He can't dribble past defenders unless it's horizontally, and he can't pass unless it's a cross. 

When Ronaldo plays against teams like Germany or France he never scores, because their defenders don't make many mistakes and because his team usually was never good enough to find a good pass to make errors or weaknesses possible. 

Weirdly enough, if Ronaldo played PSG although they're a bigger team, he would prob score because they are not good at playing an annoying defensive set up. Ronaldo has scored many times against defensive teams but it's usually because a team mate does the thing he can't do, like dribble for example.",gqfyu3p,m1sce9,Juve,2021-03-10 21:31:17,Rtgfifink,1

"I really like your analysis and agree with most of it. I didn't like CR7 at the start of his career but he gain my respect as a player and a professional each year. When he came to the team I was super excited of having him and I really thought that he will lift the Champions League trophy with us. All this said I think that we need to cash in on him, our financials are in shamble at the moment and for our books selling Cristiano will mean that we could invest in the middle of the pitch where we lack world class talent we will also need a striker. My final point is that I hope that the team give Pirlo another year to see what he could bring. This season has been incredibly hard from having almost no preseason (for a coach that has never coach is probably even harder) to the pandemic and all the injuries we've had.

"The problem with Ronaldo is that a) his wages are absurd and b) he doesn't participate in Juve's game. What I mean by that is that he rarely helps Morata and Chiesa with the high pressing which makes it extremely ineffective. Instead of participating in the quick pass-and-move style of play that Sarri and Pirlo are trying to implement, he often holds onto the ball for too long and tries to dribble through crowds which often results in him losing the ball. Then when he does inevitably lose the ball, he never runs to win it back. His freekicks are atrocious and honestly it sometimes seems like the only reason he is on the field is to score penalties. He was my favorite player for the longest time, but watching him especially this season has made me fall out of love with him. He is not the player he was at Madrid or United and I really hope Juve unload him. I think it was a mistake to sign him from the beginning.

In the heat of the moment I may have said that he should be sacked, but at the end of the day I think a 4th manager in 4 years is not going to be beneficial unless we bring a top dog like Guardiola or Klopp, and that's impossible for us atm. If Pirlo continues I really think Cristiano should go, not because he's bad or something, but because we are in a transitional phase and I think he's someone that is at the end of his career and that wants to win right now. 

If Cristiano decides to continue with us I will be grateful because he's someone that gives his all and it shows (even though games like the one we had today reminds us that he's still human) and because I know it's not easy to be in the lowest moments when someone else can offer you more, but hey, a true gentleman never leaves his lady; and even if he doesn't continue I'll be grateful for a player like him wanting to defend our colors and giving us several joys during this 3 seasons.

"I don’t understand why it’s so hard for some Juve fans to understand that our midfield is just terrible. 
Bentancur, Rabiot, Arthur....non of them has the balls to make a forward pass. It’s just embarresing at this point and i’m sick and tired of seeing Ronaldo and Morata make a forward run and NOT getting the pass.
Arthur has the skills for this but still does not. Why?
Bentancur is just overrated, he needs to go.
I don’t care if he make a great game the next one he plays. He is NOT food enough. His mentality is weak.

We need a revamp in the middle. And it’s just sad that we are so Ronaldo dependent.

Chiesa is the future tho, man what a warrior. We need to get more guys like him in the team.

I’ve said that Tek is not world class before and gotten downvoated, but that is still the truth. He is an average keeper, and a great one on some occasions.
But that is not the problem, it’s his approach.
Another weak one. Laughing when the defenders make mistake is something I never thought I would see after 15years of Buffon. 
He is not comanding at all all when he yells nobody listens.

I really don’t know what to make of McKennie. Is he good enough? I’m not convinced but he is a new one so I def feel like he deserves another season to prove that he belong here.

Ramsey is just a shadow with a high salary..

Kulusevski...oh man. As a swede this one hurts. What the hell happend here?? Started so good and now he can’t even controll the ball.

I get that it’s a young team with a young coach. But this team was meant to win the CL so don’t give me any excuse about age.
The amount of money wasted for this task is just mindblowing.

"Probably unpopular opinion: I am all in for rebuilding, but I seriously don't think Pirlo should learn coaching and gather experience @ Juventus first team. I have no bad feelings towards him, but I seriously think he will be crucified if results don't start coming next year (Juve is a big enough club for this to happen). Then it's basically another season wasted. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was outcoached this season so many times and it's very naive to think it's not going to happen next year too. Some things just come with experience, you can't get ready for everything in theory. I see people bringing up the examples of Guardiola, Zidane, but if you take a look at any other successful player-coaches, Conte, Gattuso (debatable) including the aforementioned, they all went through rough patches in a few seasons with lower level teams before getting to the big stage. This is how you learn. Juventus with such background (huge global fanbase, investors, sponsors etc.) just can't afford to underperform for multiple seasons just to give Pirlo a chance.

I would prefer to have an experienced coach from summer who can actually rebuild this team while keeping Pirlo close somewhere (like the youth team). I do believe he can be a great coach, but just not like this.",gqfk7mz,m1kue8,Juve,2021-03-10 18:22:45,emilybluntforeal,3

and while it's been frustrating, Juve still has a chance to win 2 trophies this year.... 

if this year is the low point of the past 10 years, it's hard to really complain

The reality is, we aren’t, and haven’t been for years, an elite European side. I think most people would agree we’ve been fortunate to with Seria A with the way we’ve played in recent years, just didn’t have any serious competition. 

It’s easy to point fingers at individuals but ultimately pointless. At Pirlo, at Ronaldo, at Berna, at Demiral, or before that, against Allegri, or Sarri. 

We are in decline and have been since the last year of Allegri’s tenure. Barca, Real, and us are all going through it. Man U and Chelsea have gone through it. It happens to a lot of big clubs. There are loads of reasons for it, but it’s mostly a result of lots of bad decision making over a number of years, particularly on recruitment, but the point is there is no one person to blame for all of it - our strategic decision making direction has been wrong, and we’ve taken risks that haven’t worked.

"First of all, best UCL game i have seen in at least 5 yrs. This one will go down as a classic. Hats off to Porto, amazing game by them. Also the ref was fair, can't complain at all.

Individual mistakes cost us the game, but nonetheless we should have gone through. Really unlucky in certain moments, hitting the woodwork etc. Once we went up 2-1, i noticed that we dropped the tempo almost immediately. IMO we should have gone all in and go for the 3-1 and end the game before 90mins, Porto were being rattled. We let them back into the game once we went into extra time.

Now let's talk about the players. Chiesa, what can I say 12/10. How the fuck were we not getting him engaged in the game in the first half? It seems like we were asleep once again. Once second half started we looked way different. 

Ronaldo; a really bad performance, 3/10. Sloppy touches, sloppy passes, too slow cutting inside and taking a shot and also that wall....

Morata was great once again, can't really blame the lad. Showed heart like Chiesa. The first opportunity should habe gone in though.

Cuadrado, amazing and at the same time really bad. Amazing crosses but he was time after time again getting destroyed defensively especially in the beginning. Cuadrado was always looking for the foul and when he went down the foul wasn't given and Porto got a good attack from those situations.

Arthur/Rabiot were solid. Especially Arthur is the one midfielder that we need to have in every game, insane ball control. Rabiot needs to learn how to use his right leg, he is too stiff passing with only his left.

Kulu was very impactful once he came on, his role for now should be a super-sub. 

Demiral was just frozen in the beginning but played a great game after that. Mehmet got to that header that hit the crossbar that should have been cleared by demiral and then the penalty.... Yes it was soft IMO but it did check all the signs of a penalty, soft hit on the leg but the hit wasnt that big that mehmet made it out to be...

"Okay guys I might calmed down or at least I try to not
Be angry. 

Let’s Analyse the Situation: in the last 4 years our cl journey ended 2 times in qf and 2 times in bo16. Our management completely failed to make a team which is competitive in Europe. Everybody is shitting on Pirlo, he’s got his fault too. But Sarri was not a no name coach nor Allegri and they failed the last years too. 

I’m really not somebody who likes to blame the ref, but this was horrendous. I don’t give a shit if it was his last match this year or not, he made so many stupid decisions. It’s unbelievable how bad a ref in CL can be. 

Ronaldo and Morata weren’t good today. Ronaldo has to be subbed out. I don’t care that ‘never count Ronaldo out’ it wasn’t his match today. And it’s such a stupid thing that he is untouchable. If that’s the case he needs to go. 

But let’s not forget that we lost because benta just gifted them a goal, demiral a penalty and the fact that the team can only play one half time. I’m very disgusted and depressed right now. Cheers guys.",gqdvl8k,m1ekeo,Juve,2021-03-10 07:04:00,Grumpy23,16

Someone should ask Pirlo and the team why they didn't go for the kill. Rabiot why he saying shots when he is poor at these kind of things. Juve need to learn the winning mentality from RM maybe.

"I would keep the window open to smaller clubs, by creating second, third and so forth European tiers. Let’s say each tier is made up of 24 clubs, and every season, the top 6 are promoted and the bottom 6 clubs are relegated. In addition, I’d propose the creation of an FA Cup-style competition where the top clubs in the UEFA ranking start from the bottom rounds, and the lower the tier of the club, the higher the seeding.  Eg.: Bayern Munich and Manchester City start in the first round, but Atalanta and Zenit in the third round.",gq8cby8,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 01:25:42,magicajuveale,7
"&gt;I think this is a terrible idea that would destroy the smaller clubs and would make reach the top or being the dark-horse even rarer 

The point is Serie A is falling behind compared to the other top leagues, the PL especially is getting a massive lead which is increasing year by year (I think the last team from the PL is getting as much money as the winner of Serie A), and even if now we can still somewhat compete, this will change in just a few years.  
Where will we be in 20 years? Will we be there, or will we fall further and further? The latter is more likely.

The superleague would level the difference between the leagues, for the teams competing in it. By being in it, we'd surely keep being competitive with the best teams in Europe.

Yes, it's bad for smaller clubs, but football is no longer a sport, it's a business nowadays.

&gt;and I don't think that is the right spirit of football

It's business, you think for yourself, not for the other clubs, and the ""spirit of football"" doesn't take you anywhere. Ajax has tradition, history, football philisophy, produces talents every year, and look at where they are now due to the league not being financially competitive. This will be our end too, if this trend goes on.

&gt; I imagine that after 10 times (random number) after facing Manchester City or any to club, it wouldn't be that special anymore

That doesn't matter, the revenues from sponsors and TV deals we'd receive are massive compared to what we get now, that's why we're pushing for it.",gq8ado8,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 01:11:55,Starbuck1992,29
"Honestly, I don't like the idea either. 

The top-tier clubs and the rich clubs are already making more money then Juve. They'd just make exponentially more in a Super League, so sure we'd make more, but they'd just outpace us by however much more.

So it's not like it would enable us to suddenly compete for the Mbappe's and Neymars of the world. We'd still be struggling to keep up financially. 

And performance on the pitch wise, that would likely mean that we wouldn't be one of the clubs dominating that competition, we'd be a ""soft"" team in it.",gq8x6vm,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 03:52:52,daddytorgo,5
"That would be the worst idea... If such a league is made, all the top 4 teams will have to withdraw from from their domestic leagues, leaving the average &amp; poor teams behind and since there is no relegation they're stuck there.. Most of the lucrative sponsor / TV deals will cover the new league..

I want Juventus to be a financial powerhouse, but not at the cost of stepping on the necks of every mid &amp; bottom tier clubs out there.",gq8z9up,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 04:07:56,Ejsberg,4

"Changing to a super league would only be a temporary financial gain, people will get bored of having big teams constantly play each other, some of these big teams won’t be big teams in comparison anymore. And if there’s a relegation system, any big team can become a small team and this super league might back fire. this isn’t for the love of the sport, this is for the love of money that would simply be temporary. Fans will choose to continue supporting their domestic league. This super league will not be successful longterm as the excitement of two big teams will die down due to always seeing big teams play against each other 

If a relegation system is implemented this will mean big teams will constantly get relegated and since every team is a top level team in the super league, any team can find themselves relegated meaning they would end up losing money and this whole league was created for financial gain in the first place. Really doesn’t seem like a great idea at all",gq8kjcp,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 02:22:02,patkenz,2
"The awful idea that will give more money to billionairies running biggest clubs. Only teams from few countries would be available to join so you are sidelining most of europe from competition. The level of football academies will crumble too. It destroys national football as fifa already said a ban on players would be made and if not the only way the Superleague clubs let them play National teams is if federations pay millions of insurances just like for NBA players.

Some players would earn more money but for everyone else it would be a lose of money because clubs that stay behind will have less money. And for the ones that get into Superleague and get more money Im sure they will put salary caps very fast. All those billionairies would prefer money going into their pockets instead of players.

Agnelli said something about football not being popular with Gen Z because there is not enough competetive matches which i think is bullshit. The bigger reason for football not resonating with new generations is because most of football is only on premium channels. No one who is not a big fan already will pay additional money to see football no matter who plays.

To be honest all of this Agnellis interviews about this make me think of him as a very priviliged person who was teached to be bussinesman since a child and he has no other values than money.",gqb19mo,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 15:47:22,wilins96,1
"I think this is really shit and I hate Agnelli for pushing this, I am honeslty ashamed of it. 

This is the unfairest thing that can be done and will kill football. I have sworn that if the superleague is done I would simply stop watching football and not give an euro anymore to those thieves. I'll probably start supporting a small local club just to enjoy going to the stadium from time to time and that would be it. 

This is a terrible idea which we all have to fight against, write to your club or supporters local associations to say that you don't want this shit. 

What is a supporter of Verona expected to do if this goes really on? It is disrespectful and I am so mad at this that I think that UEFA should even start sanctioning (or temp banning) anyone even speaking about it. 

I also think that UEFA and FIFA should forbid players who participate in the superleague to participate in their competitions, so no more Euro and World Cup for them, suckers.

Agnelli can fuck off and I wish that we change president asap. John Elkan would be great but I guess he has more important things to do other than taking care of a football team...",gqb91vo,m0jjji,Juve,2021-03-09 17:55:17,FurlanPinou,1

And now I should feel sorry for them? Now I should accept that my club be held back because they can't get their shit together? Sorry , I suffered too much pain in those days and I will never forgive them all. Imagine if they spent their efforts trying to better the league and improve the brand.

"I'm started to watch football pretty late. I was 10 when we with mom moved to another apartment, I met  new friends and they already had favorite teams, both from our national championship and from top leagues. So I started to watch every football possible. In 90s there wasn't so many options in Russia. Foreign leagues I could see only in sport news summaries. This is why I remember so good the moment that changed my life.

It was a december 1994. Serie A already got my attention because of cool team names. I always liked Italy and language, so names of clubs was very cool for me. And there was a goals video from game of Juventus against Fiorentina. I already knew that this clubs are rivals. Didn't know why btw. So when I saw this 0-1, 0-2, 1-2, 2-2 sequence I already sorry that couldn't watch a full game. But then I saw a best goal in history of the game. Last minutes, everyone is tired already, very high longball from central line, fast guy with dark long hair slip between 2 big CB and by one touch, with outside of the foot, hit the ball in close upper corner, finishing a comeback win. It was so incredibly perfect that I still haven't seen goal better. I saw more important, more technically difficult, but never such perfect in combination of factors. In that day Alex Del Piero become a God of football and avatar of Juventus for me.

25 years later nothing really changed for me. Yes, Alex retired, but Juve is still here, fighting with everything they got against whole league.",gpisx6g,lwm50y,Juve,2021-03-03 19:03:17,Abarakadavr,3

"I have 0 ties to Italy or anything related but in 2001 my father played in a small weekend league in a small town in Mexico. They used this knockoff Juve jersey but I had no idea what Juve was at the time. I really loved that jersey because I always thought it reminded me of refs from other sports, I always kinda saw it as Refs Vs. Players. 

One day while hanging out at my cousin's, we were watching TV. He had satellite tv so he had a bunch of channels and while scrolling, I saw that jersey and watched my first ever Juve match.

I tried to watch as many Juve matches as I could but it wasn't always available but still I tried to keep up. I learned a few names but my favorite was Trezeguet

So yeah I started liking Juve because of a Jersey, but kept following ever since 2001. In fact it's probably my favorite team across any sport because it's the only team that I actually picked myself to like. Every team I follow I kinda was raised into by my dad but Juve was my own favorite team and is still my favorite football team, although Club America has a special place in my heart as it's my family team and I was raised into being a fan.

Edit: Also I found out that I started watching on Buffon's first season in Juve so when he retires I'm going to be really fucking hurt and I'm not ready to hurt again (I'm still not fully over how much Il Principino's departure hurt)",gpiw68u,lwm50y,Juve,2021-03-03 19:50:32,Irwin911,2

"Grew up only being exposed to mostly english football via rebroadcast on our local TV. Mostly it was FA Cup matches in an old program called ""road to wembley"". So we are talking early 80s. Liked John Barnes and so thought everything British was king. Consequence of colonialism I guess.

Anyway, only vague memories of the 86 world cup as I was a small child but the entire fervor and excitement of the world cup stuck with me so by the time '90 rolled around I was old enough to understand the game etc and then I was exposed to more than just english players. The way italy played..zenga,schillaci,baggio and the rest captivated me and I actively sought out Italian football. Not easy in my country in those years and seeing Italian club games was a rarity but I remained a Baggio fan and by 94 the best players were playing in serie a. I followed Juve because of Baggio but the swashbuckling style of that time and the personalities...ravanelli, vialli especially kept me there and the rest is history. My Juve idols are Baggio, Del Piero, Davids, Nedved but lots of love along the way for the other guys like Ferrara, tevez, Trezegol... Too many to mention.

"If the Pirlo era has taught us one thing, it is that both us, the fans, and the management have been focusing too much on the names we sign.

Instead we should be asking ourselves whether a certain player fits the tactics and playing style of the manager.

Ramsey is a good example of this: he hasn’t performed at all so far, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that a younger player who is worth €50 million would do any better.

Let’s focus on characteristics rather than big names.",gw6il3w,n0eu03,Juve,2021-04-28 23:17:28,h0wn0tt04,0

"Pirlo's only fault ( and it's not even a fault) was accepting the job with not even a minute of experience at a lower level, especially when the competition was Conte, who we all know is a crazy bastard when it comes to try to win the league. 

Xavi rejected Barca cause he thought he wasn't ready yet. Pirlo COULD have done the same, but when Juve come knocking on your door, what can you really say besides yes?

 It's the managements fault appointing Pirlo if you're trying to win something, and it's the managements fault for having this extremely expensive squad if you're trying to rebuild to some extent. Which is why a lot of Juve fans are pro letting Ronaldo go and starting with a new generation with the current core of players ( Mckennie, De ligt, Kulu etc.)",gw17885,mzkdgs,Juve,2021-04-27 17:51:30,georgedavidrs,88

Pirlo did everything he can. I am pretty sure he gave 100% all the time, because he is professional. Unfortunately being a coach and a player are two different things, but this is not his fault. There are many problems around the team right now and the lack of Pirlo's experience only one of them.

"I love Pirlo. I think any TRUE fan feels the same. Juventus is obviously a club, a project, a team, that is a passion for Pirlo. When they ask, of course he’d say yes. He wanted to help in a bad time. 

It’s not all that much different than AdP staying despite the relegation Juventus suffered. After all, he said it best, “a gentleman doesn’t abandon his Old Lady.” 

Pirlo is a gentleman and he loves the Old Lady. You can see it wasn’t about money when you look at his relatively cheap salary. He is a true servant of the club. It’s just too bad Pirlo doesn’t have the experience to successfully navigate the club’s problems. These problems are not all on him. However, Juve does need an experienced manager to guide them before this turns into an even worse crisis. 

I’m grateful Pirlo gave it his best shot to guide the club. I hope he learned a lot. I wish hos tenure was a great trophy-laden success because he will always be a beloved Juventini. He has the class within him. My hope would be for him to take a step back with his role and learn from Allegri as an assistant or with the U23 team. 

Then, I hope he can (and is willing to) come back stronger and lead the first team to glory.

"He didn't hire himself but he accepted nontheless, he could have refused and started building his career from the U23. It's not like he was desperately in need of a job.

Unfortunately for him, he's not showing the right qualities to be a top manager. Sure, the circumstances are not favourable, but the good ideas he shown in the first couple of months just vanished and his lack of character is showing. One thing is to be a leader on the pitch because of your playing style, but showing leadership as a coach is a completely different sport.

Nothing is lost as of now, but not reaching a CL spot could mean the end of his coaching career.

They're a team in transition, in dire need of a rebuild, and that stops with the senior management. But, appoint an inexperienced coach, and the narrative has changed. Suddenly, it's because of ""naivety"" or ""unclear instructions"", rather than the management decision to pay over €600,000 per week between Ramsey and Rabiot, who contribute nothing, instead of signing 5 players who could have given some squad depth. Pirlo will be sacked to cover their failings. In comes another manager for the cycle to repeat.

"Out of all of those I would probably just like Donnarumma and Depay.

Aguero spends more time on twitch than on the pitch, Giroud is not a player that scores lots of goals/assists in the league, Messi is not going to happen, Boateng and Ramos would like to play everything and would also ask for a lot of money since they're probably looking for their last big contract, and Hakan doesn't improve what we already have in Dybala. 

Vazquez would be nice if he played on the left, but on the right we already have Kulu/Cuadrado/Chiesa that could play as RM and Cuadrado/Danilo as RB, and they rarely get injured.

"Pirlo did a lot more to deserve to be sacked than either Sarri or Allegri - but I have to say I look to what happened to Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea when they declined and we should be careful what we wish for. They sacked their managers every other year and it didn’t help, personally I think it made it worse. 

Sacking your coach every year has 2 problems 

1- it isn’t enough time for any manager to rebuild a squad and arguably isn’t enough time to fairly judge them

2 - it tends to distract from the fundamental underlying issues within a squad and let’s the players who are consistently underperforming off the hook while the board give a new manager more time. It also means you don’t have a consistent strategy for recruiting replacements. Different managers will often want different types of players. If the last 3-4 years has taught us anything it’s that you can’t just buy lots of talented players without a strategy and hope they’ll fit together. 


I’m not saying Pirlo doesn’t deserve to be sacked, I’m saying you’re mad if you think a new coach will fix all our problems. Even if we get Guardiola or Klopp I would genuinely doubt that they can get this squad back to the European elite.",gvumyx4,myds96,Juve,2021-04-26 03:41:48,downfallndirtydeeds,23

"It was always a long term plan, build around a young coach and young players. If they back off now, what is the plan? Plan B obviously, the same that has been tried for years under Conte and Allegri, etc. That was Plan A then, things have changed. 

Juve realized you cannot win the UCL or at least establish yourself there as a regular force if nothing comes from within the club, that is by buying starts year in year out in the hope they somehow gel together and make wonders. 

My guess is they will stick to the current plan, whether we qualify for the UCL or not. It is all good to scream that the club is underperforming, but you have to take a step back and look at what is happening with other clubs too and realize we are not in that bad of a situation, it is for the better.

The problem (youth) is finally being addressed and we have a coach that goes with that plan. What Pirlo is saying is basically what the club had expected: They expected things not to go according to ""plans"", their expectations included failing so badly, but for the greater good on the long term. It is just not easy to explain especially to ""die hard"" supporters who expect glory morning and night!

"I just think it was too soon for Pirlo. He had no managerial experience and was expected to come in and lead this club to some sort of glory. It was a bad hire. Pirlo is a legend of the club but he should be managing a youth team in order to build managerial experience instead of just being thrown into the fire immediately. Even Zidane was the manager of Real Madrid Castilla (their second league side) for about two years. Overall it was just a failure of an experiment; this doesn’t mean Pirlo will be a bad manager forever, but instead that he needs more experience and more time and I don’t think it’s smart of Juventus to let him continue to lead the team if they want to become a competitive team again",gvuma6w,myds96,Juve,2021-04-26 03:36:15,Kdog_79,7
"Should be sacked, just my honest opinion. He didn’t live up to the least expectations we had for him. Would it be any other manager he would have been gone mid season. I don’t think we should make exceptions because he was a former legend as a player. He needs a lot of improvement and I think Juve was a too big to begin with for him.

What happened to the Midfielders like Pirlo, Pogba, Marchisio, Vidal, Pjanic, etc. who could create chances and be playmakers.

When you have fast and tall strikers like CR7 and Morata, you want to play to their strengths but very rarely do I see the midfield do that. It’s so painful seeing one of Cristianos and Morata’s perfect runs go unnoticed because the reality is that the midfield don’t have the vision, passing, or game iq to do that.

"Yes, he’s on bad form and holds up play with his pointless skill moves, but suddenly you guys forget how much Cristiano has done for us. He’s the top scorer of Serie A and is still banging 30+ goals a season even at 36 y/o and also Cristiano was the one saving our ass in crucial moments/games for the past year. 

Then, Dybala has been so average at best this season yet you guys treat him like a golden boy. Just shows how much you guys hate him because you didn’t want him to be brought into Juve in the first place and his big wages. 

So if we sell Cristiano, who will be our main goal scorer?

If juve manage to sell ronaldo at the end of the season it would be incredible. I mean jesus these last 2 games for juve, and the 3 he had recently for portugal. Just atrocious.

Its just cringeworthy, for the love of god I want just 1 player/manager to call him out on his bs, next time he blames his teammates after he inevitably gives away the ball or makes the wrong choice in attack.

2. Kulu has been another berna this year. Even if he turns out the be great as he is young and i like him as a player. It has to be said he has been garbage.

I’m gonna get crucified but Jesus Christ Ronaldo, Buffon is yelling at everyone to jump, you have Cuadrado on the ground too. Why ignore your keeper and not jump? It went just over your head and they scored? Same thing against Porto. 
Otherwise he had an off game and I hope he gets back to usual. 

Dybala looked quite good today, Sandro proved me wrong and had a good game. De Ligt was world class as usual.

With every moment passing I'm becoming more pro-Agnelli......

"So many delusional kids here, still complaining that we are being wronged, Agnelli doesn't give a fuck about the fans or the team, he is seeing it as just a business, he is the one along with Perez that is pushing this shit so hard and doesn't want to back down.

Even the American owners of the English clubs listened to the fans and admitted they were wrong (they didn't really mean it but still), but fucking Agnelli keeps thinking about his own pockets and instead of apologizing he says 'I wasn't wrong you are too stupid and stubborn, and you are ruining my plans of getting richer', and for him is way worse because he comes from a family that is part of the team's history, unlike the rest who are foreigners just for the money, he is a disgrace to the Juventus legacy that his family has.

I know that most of the mods here are Americans who couldn't give less of a fuck about the European football pyramid, or CR7 fanboys that are here just for him and that they were absolutely delighted with the idea of ESL, but no real Juventino can accept this bullshit!

The great thing about CHL is that anybody (theoretically) can win it, not just a few rich ones, and if we don't make it to the top 4 (of seria a) we don't deserve to be there! why the fuck should we have a guaranteed place and not Atalanta or Roma even if they play better than us and finish above us in a season that we don't? because we have a bigger brand name? fuck no! we should earn everything that we do fair and square not by creating our own self jerking league!",gvbeery,mvdyee,Juve,2021-04-21 20:31:01,Disc2jockey,2

Should they pay UEFA/FIFA ? Can they sell their own TV rights for that mini trophy?

"The whole story feels bad. First of all it’s stupid if Agnelli resigns. All the clubs were involved. Not just real and juve. And football/soccer proved again that nobody wants changes there. 

Second, where are these people who talk about moral and ‘the death of football’ when shit like Qatar, finals in Saudi Arabia, billionaires who buys a club or a team ,like Bayern, buys all the talent of the league? All of sudden there is no problem with that? Man city acting like the heroes, but didn’t know what could happened when they agreed? Everyone backing out, because they fear the consequences. Like they give a shit about fans. All teams are like companies with actions. They thought about the money when they agreed, not because football might become better. 

What pisses me of is that football right now in imbalanced. PL gets a ton of money, some other clubs are sponsored by some billionaires or other cheat their way out of financial fair play. Teams like Verona Cagliari etc who cried about the ESL can’t even reach the CL because they can’t get the money to build such a team. Same as small teams in other leagues. The American system is so much better than this shit. I don’t blame agnelli and Perez for having a different idea.

"I am glad that Juve acknowedgled the reaction from the other clubs involved without wiping out the project entirely. They also recognize that the project cannot go ahead in its present form, so that leaves hope for certain reforms that can make the idea more convincing in the future. 

I have a feeling also that City, Chelsea and RM pulled out from fear of being banned from the current CL, who knows. I doubt supporters' pressure has much to do with it all, and I am hoping this is just a first dip to test the waters before really plunging in. I do not get the feeling either from any of the clubs' stances that they are fully committed to backtracking entirely from the idea. Some mention they have begun the procedures to withdraw. None seems to unequivocally banish the idea for the present let alone for the future. Even Bayern's and PSG's reluctance to join look more like a well orchestrated public coms manoeuvre to see ""what gives"" and hopefully polish the whole deal for a decisive blow in the future.

"Agnelli has finally admitted defeat. An embarrassing last 72 hours for the club and some fans. Talking about a draft in football, salary caps, parity and solidarity. That has never been the case in European football. Back when Italy actually meant something in Europe, you think they would've shown solidarity towards other clubs? No, you try to continue to win everything and to stay ahead. Italy and the serie A has failed massively in this. 

So now that we're struggling to even qualify for the CL there needs to be some kind of solidarity? Get out of here. The club has been poorly managed these last few seasons, with some shocking transfers and wages. We're simply spending too much money as a club and failed to recover funds via CL (hello defeats against Porto, Ajax and Lyon!). This is a reality check for us, we don't have the funds like the premier league teams so we need to do better as a club. Actually invest in the youth academy and find some talents, instead of the usual overpay for a premier league reject. Our CL final run in 14-15 wasn't with any 80m+ transfer, but a great team with passion and a good coach. 

And yes, UEFA isn't the savior we need in this time. They are a part of the problem too, but you won't fix that by creating another closed &amp; elitist competition that goes against the basic principles of football. You win, you get in.",gvb0yww,mv3j6l,Juve,2021-04-21 17:37:17,Babostainer,10
"They made UEFA pay more revenues from now on and 2024 there will be 2 teams invited like if Juventus is 5 or 6 in Serie A, UEFA can bring them to UCL by invite so thats also a win for this teams. There been news that 4-6 billion is avaible to give away all of sudden.

Richer gets richer always its been like this in everything all the time. These teams have studied how much money UEFA makes and made these moves. 

My opinion always have been there should be some kind of salary cap so teams would be more even. Salary cap also could help players that are good but stuck on a bench that could be a missing piece to other teams. Like Isco not gettin playing time but Real affords to keep him on the bench and ask a too big fee for him. He could be a great deal for us. Someone that can keep the ball and give that last pass to assist. 

But yeah my point is this teams knew what they was doing and won. My biggest fear is that cup finals and maybe 1-2 last rounds if the league is tight there will be some kind of pay per view thing. Beside of paying monthly fees on top of that 20-50€ to see the UCL final. I hope they dont read this and take notes =D",gvb0f7m,mv3j6l,Juve,2021-04-21 17:28:36,Shambuktu,4

"So I need some clarification on the Agnelli situation. From what I understand the club is denying that he's resigned but it's confusing with so many contradictory articles coming out one after another that I'm just not sure. So I'm going to say this:

If Agnelli hasn't resigned or isn't in the process of doing so he should be embarrassed quite frankly. For those who might not know Alexander Ceferin, the UEFA president, commented in a little depth on 2 specific people, Ed Woodward who has now resigned, and especially on Agnelli. Agnelli told Ceferin on Saturday afternoon that the ESL talk was only rumours and that he'd call him back and then turned his phone off. This is a quote from Ceferin:

*""I don't want to speak much about Andrea Agnelli. He is probably one of the biggest disappointments or the biggest of all. I don't want to be too personal but the fact is that I have never seen a person that would lie so many times and persistently than he did. It was unbelievable.""*

The fact that it's confusing whether he's resigned or not is frankly disgusting after this. I wanna clarify it's not only Agnelli whose actions have been disgusting, this plan has been in the works for a while, a 177-page contract had been drawn up so these executives have been sat in Serie A meetings, Premier League meetings, La Liga meetings, UEFA meetings for months if not years discussing the future of those leagues and lied in the faces of their peers, especially UEFA who they'd have directly backstabbed with this competition, how can they be trusted from here on out?

But this is the Juve sub so I'll finish by saying Agnelli has driven this club to a very vulnerable place, there's enough talking about the issues with the club at present on this sub that I shouldn't need to go into it, but in the wake of this catastrophic and embarrassing error of judgement and complete breach of trust, Agnelli needs to go.

Edit: So apparently Agnelli, the Vice-Chairman of the ESL, told the newspaper la Repubblica in an interview carried out on Tuesday evening, before  a meeting of the ESL teams, that the departure of the English teams from ESL won’t stop them proceeding forward with the league and that the project still had a “100% chance of being a success.” Can this man embarrass himself any further? This man sat there with a straight face and told a reporter that not only is he refusing to back down but that the project would be a success moments before a meeting that would culminate in the ESL deciding to indefinitely suspend the league. This either shows a ridiculous naïveté or just a pathological liar, either way this surely can only damage the image of Juventus by showing that unlike the 6 English teams we refused to back down from this league even as it was falling down around us. So let me ask does anyone actually still want this man in charge of our club?",gv9pxtm,mv3j6l,Juve,2021-04-21 08:30:53,Wolf_Todd,23

"It's all about money. The main reason for the super League is that UEFA don't pay enough to the clubs. Super League would be avoided if UEFA just wanted to pay more but they don't. On the other hand Premier League sides gain 2-3x times more money a season than for example juve does and that's the main reason why agnelli has been doing these actions about rebranding and ESL: to compete better. Now Premier League sides have an advantage over other leagues' clubs in the transfer market.

I think that alternative choice would be if UEFA or FIFA would set a transfer and salary gap. For example each club would be allowed to spend for example 100 millions per transfer window. Therefore the price of players would decrease. Then no club would have no advantage over other on spending and the competition would be tighter and more fair. Then teams like Sassuolo would be also able to attract great players and matches between mid table teams would be a much more interesting. That way even the leagues would benefit from that. Additionally clubs would save money on transfer window and hence profit more. Even UEFA wouldn't have to pay more which they don't wanna do.",gv5qw3t,mu0i5n,Juve,2021-04-20 10:42:29,jaakkola16,24

Where was the integrity of the sport when Madrid built their Galacticos team, or when Abramovich bought Chelsea, or whenever City and PSG do transfers, or when FIFA decided to host a World Cup in Qatar. The integrity of the sport died when TV revenue became the main source of profit for teams instead of the fans at the gate.

"The fact that the top teams here are mostly in agreement and willing to stand for a new league shows a few things.

-They want more money. Is it greed? Maybe. Probably. But it can also be because playing in UEFA leagues (UCL and UEL) is simply not profitable enough to sustain clubs. Juve has been hemorrhaging money, and so have other clubs. So I can understand why they'd want to get more money.
-They're sick of UEFA. UEFA is a corrupt, hypocritical slime of an organization that has for decades operated out of greed and self interest. This isn't news. Everyone knows it, and now that the top teams have proposed a way to loosen that chokehold that UEFA currently has, UEFA plays victim. 
-Football changes. It has before, and it will continue to. The clubs know this and have to be open-minded.

Personally speaking, I'm not exactly a fan of this Super League, but I understand why it's being proposed. I think the quasi-unanimous attitude the clubs involved have shows that this wasn't spontaneous but rather long overdue (in their minds) and the current situation (COVID) has quickened the process.

"I'll try to articulate my thoughts here.

I'm a Juventus fan. Period. I'm not a casual fan, I'm a tifoso that doesn't care about other clubs, not even my own town's team.

This situation has been brewing for around 30 years, the situation of clubs increasing spending on a yearly basis, and we Italians started it all in the 90s and early 2000s, with Milan, Juventus, Inter, Lazio and Parma buying all the best players for increasingly preposterous sums of money, then Real, Barça and Premier League teams followed suit.

Football fans do have a narrow view, but football has been an entertainment product for around 30 years, I think that when you put so much money into a sport it changes from sport to entertainment.

There are billions of people around the world who follow the most dominant clubs, maybe they change club every now and then, or just follow players.

I'll give you two, rather personal examples: in the 90s I used to watch the NBA, but I wasn't actually following the NBA, I wanted to watch the Chicago Bulls because of Michael Jordan, over the last few years I've started watching the NFL, I watch their weekly highlights on YouTube and, when the matches are not shown during the night, I'll watch a match, but I won't just watch any match, I'll watch the matches where the big teams and big players are playing, like Tom Brady and Gronkowski.

This Super League caters to people like me, but those people love and watch football - whereas I, for example, just like American Football but don't care enough to pay for it -, and they want to watch the best teams and the best players. And there are a lot of people like this, and TV networks willing to pay good money to show those big matches to those people.

As for us (Juventus), we're not getting enough money from UCL and Serie A to compete against those other teams, if this Super League thing can give us more money and exposure maybe it will level the playing field a bit for us, because, honestly, at the moment, we don't really stand a chance. We haven't won anything international since 1996 (1997 if we count the Intercontinental Cup), even if during the late 90s we were the absolute strongest team in Europe.

It's perfectly understandable that UEFA and FIFA, as well as national leagues, are so strongly opposed to it, they'll still sell their tournaments to TV networks worldwide, but the asking price will have to be much lower, because, the moment you can't show those teams and players, no network, in their right mind, will accept to pay the money that those entities are currently asking for.

The same goes for the Euro and World Cup, the moment that you prevent those big players from taking part in the World Cup - as long as it is legally possible to ban them from those competitions - who is going to want to watch, let's say Brazil Vs England, or Spain Vs Belgium when most of the big names won't be in that match? Of course Brazilian, English, Spanish and Belgian fans will still watch those matches, but I feel many ""casual fans"" around the world won't watch those matches, I know that I, as an Italian, would lose interest in a potential Brazil Vs England if the big players are not in that match, and I feel that many others would feel the same, I don't know how many people, let's say, in Arab countries or South America or Asia, would watch a match between foreign countries' teams without the best and most recognizable players.

I get it, the Super League, if it goes through, won't be as coveted as the UCL, it lacks history, and history is what makes the UCL so coveted, but whoever wins the Super League would have pretty solid ground claiming they're the best team in Europe.

I also think that those clubs, who are run like corporations, and rightfully so, along with JP Morgan, probably ran some kind of market research to make sure that their proposed product would spark more interest, and, therefore, earn more money, than the UCL; I also somewhat think, or hope, that they held extensive talks with law experts to make sure the foreseeable repercussions won't be as bad as UEFA, FIFA and governments claim they will be.",gv6vhsq,mu0i5n,Juve,2021-04-20 19:39:43,[deleted],15

"I’ve been watching this unfold for the last 21 hours at this point, and have been watching this unfold live. I didn’t want to make any rushed opinions, so I’ve read all the info out there and had a long think about it. Here’s my two cents:

If the teams weren’t permanent in the ESL, it would be perfect. The founding teams would be able to be relegated, but still get a small amount of winnings, as they have financial committed to the cause. Teems would continue on with domestic competition, meaning that supporters get more football while still being able to go to local games. The spirit of the game would not fade away.

How the ESL pro/demotion would work: the 2 bottom teams of both groups go are relegated, plus a decider between the 3rd last placed in both groups. 5 teams in and out each season. The winners of the Champions, Europa and Conference League, plus the runners up of the the two former teams would go into the super league the following season.

This method has multiple advantages; the founding teems would still get more revenue, which is what this is ultimately about. With 20 teams in the ESL, 20 places would open up in the conference league so that teems from smaller nations could join. It would also get smaller teams for, the top 5 leagues to join, which even out the playing field for the rest of the competition.

It would mean more home games, meaning fans can go watch their home side more often, increasing club revenue and the economy as a whole. This would apply to all teams from conference to super.

The increase in games mean players are more tired and more injuries occur. Teams would have to invest heavily into youth development. More young players would be given their chance to shine for big teems. This also means that clubs would have to expand their outreach to kids, especially in smaller or underdeveloped countries, where they can support poor economies. It would bring football to more people than ever, while increasing the quality of players in the long run. I do also believe that there should be a minimum amount of time they give to youth players in the first team to in courage this.

The same pundits talking about how this is the end of the sport will do a 10 minute segment on Manchester United-Granada and mention Granada like once.

God help the conference league, people will rag on it even more and take it even less seriously.

All the fan banter these days is about who’s a big club and who’s a small club. Big clubs are run knowing that if you miss out on champions league even for one year it can be disastrous and leave you on the isle of washed clubs. Basically the entire LOGIC of the sport right now is that there are like 10-15 teams and their fans and nobody talks about any of the others, but we’re still somehow shocked that the clubs took it all seriously and said “ok you wanted only the big clubs now it’s only the big clubs fr fr.”",guzmocr,mtfho3,Juve,2021-04-19 01:37:59,jct1121,50

"This makes me genuinely embarrassed - I won’t support the club in these competitions and I won’t watch it. I will always be a Juve fan but as long as they are involved in this competition I will be an embarrassed one 

If you’re a fan of the super league, then you have to be honest with yourself and say you put the status and financial situation of Juve above the health of football 

The super league will:
- drain money away from all the domestic leagues in Europe who are participating. There will be less money for all the teams that need it most and it will fundamentally undermine the whole football pyramid

- in the middle of a fucking pandemic these cunts have chosen greed over generosity, the super league will undoubtedly mean that more small clubs will go under and there will be less money for smaller leagues and teams to survive 

- it will massively skew and augment the existing financial disparities between the elite clubs and everyone else. There is already too much of a financial gap between the clubs at the top and bottom and it makes the current situation worse where because of money there is less meaningful competition in football 

- the idea that you qualify for these massive financial benefits and a European completion without having to win your way there is fundamentally unsporting - if we finish 5th this year we don’t deserve bundles of cash and to play in Europe because we didn’t win our way there. What incentive do the players have to play? Where’s the jeopardy in the matches?

- the pathetic entitlement notion of franchise football is disgusting, clubs acting like their history gives them a right to be in a competition rather than how they perform on the pitch is a total joke 

- worst of all in my book, this just isn’t what football is, it’s a working class game, not some elite Bullshit millionaire’s boys club.

"This is going to be an extremely unpopular opinion, but why are we mad about this now?

I didn't see Juve fans up in arms when we dominated a weak serie a for 10 years, outspending everyone. Didn't see the ""fans of football"" rise up when Juve bought Roma and Napoli's best players at will. We didn't see ""fans of football"" when Liverpool raided Roma for Salah and Allisson. No one cared about ""fairness"" then.

Now we all care about the integrity of the game? Fans are just as responsible. We all want Juve to buy better players every year and win - well to win, you need money, and if you need money, you need more lucrative leagues.

Serie A is on the brink. Clubs are barely surviving, stadiums are crumbling. Atalanta couldnt even play CL in their home stadium. We all like to believe in the story of Leicester but it happens once in a hundred years. Serie A trashed Juve continually, the rest of the clubs don't play games, skip the rules, and then don't get punished. And Juventus should stay here in this shit show?

Did you forget that they gave the next World Cup to Qatar, who is literally killing lives for stadiums?

Did you forget the bazillion of corruption cases that involved uefa, FIFA, Leya Serie a and all the other leagues too? I mean there is evidence for all of this and just because these institutions are to powerful, no one cares. 

So yeah, maybe you don’t like the idea of the new league. Maybe you don’t like changes. But two things are clear: 1) football is already a business. Money above everything.

"The saddest thing about this game, it reminded me of when juve and napoli were fighting for the tittle and the only reason we won was because we actually had a bench and could bring players on where sarri only used 11-13 players all season. Say what you want about pirlo but atalanta subs improved the game our subs were a level bellow the players they replaced. Im not saying you should have a dybala/chiesa on the bench but someone that can give you something, something different? We got nothing but another gift from arthur to the other team.

Sorry to say but holy shit! Our mids are beyond garbage. Benta and rabiot played ok and im like WOW!!!! Bcas never seen them play like this and they couldnt even keep that going for a bit.

For real other than mckennie? Rabiot/benta/arthur/ramsey? Any of them go meh who cares.

If Pirlo has any balls he will resign at the end of the season.

You don’t keep Atalanta out that long without everyone playing their part, yes including the midfielders we all hate. 

Also if you would’ve told me Juve is about to play the last 30 minutes of a 0-0 vs Atalanta without Ronaldo, Chiesa, or Dybala, I could’ve told you ahead of time it wasn’t gonna end well lol.

"Rabiot had a solid first half, was very active all over the pitch. Second half he disappeared a bit.

Benta - did decent defensively, but he is just too static. 

McKennie - guy still ran his guts out and created some opportunities. Not a lot was going right today but at least he made things happen.

Arthur - Just poor. Lost the ball way too much, and for fresh legs to move as slow as he was just isn't acceptable. I put the goal down to him mostly for how slow he was moving across. 

Defence was pretty solid - Chiellini played out of his skin. That body block he did was real memorable. 

Morata - very mixed. Held up the ball well on a few occasions but lost the ball too easily on others. Had a golden chance to score but just didn't have the conviction to put it in the net. I was hoping for more from him though.

Dybala - did ok, couldn't expect much more considering the fitness level. 

A draw was a fair result but our luck has just been shit this season. These injuries and the way we conceded really illustrate that. If Sarri had as bad a run of luck last season I doubt we would've been playing for our 10th straight this season.",guz4w1u,mte95w,Juve,2021-04-18 23:14:27,Centerba_miva,5

"Ok, this is my point of view as Italian. My dad is juventino, but if you think it should be easy, you should also know that ... we live in Milan. So it's like being a tribe surrounded by milanisti and interisti. Actually I respect rossoneri because the Berlusconi years (they were the best, it's true) but I hate nerazzurri shits with all my heart. We have a lot of pressure here, so every game you win is a party and at the same time every game you lose is a tragedy. The day after can be heaven or hell.

When I'm abroad and we talk about football, everyone asks me ""why do you support a Turin team when there are two great teams in Milan?"" What kind of question is that? It's like asking why you fell in love with one woman rather than another. Juve is more than a Turin team, it's like a national team, when you watch a match at the Stadium you can hear and meet people from all Italian regions and, of course, from other nations as well.

When I fall in love with Juve? I remember the day of 18th scudetto... Zoff, Gentile, Cabrini, Causio, Furino, Tardelli, Bettega and our beloved Gaetano Scirea. Then Rossi, Brady, the 2nd star, Platini, Boniek, Laudrup... and then all great players you already know.Today I can say I have celebrated more scudetti than other teams have won in their entire history.

"I'm from Newcastle, UK. Our local team plays in black and white striped shirts. They used to broadcast Italian football on a Sunday afternoon in the UK. 9-year old me thinks I'm watching Newcastle until I spot Roberto Baggio... and after that, Juve are my second team. Pretty much my first now, since Newcastle have ceased to be a club with any ambition or anything other than a free advertising board for the owner. 

First time I saw Juventus play live was against Newcastle in the Champions League in 2002. Newcastle became the first team in history to lose their first 3 games and still qualify from the group stage after winning their next 3, one of which was a 1-0 home win over Juventus. Andy Griffin scored the goal. Gianluigi Buffon was in goal for Juventus. Griffin retired in 2014 😱

I sat quietly in the Inter Ultras in the Curva Nord at the San Siro in 2015 watching my first Juventus away game. We drew 0-0.

I've been lucky. I saw Baggio absolutely dismantle Parma in the 1995 Scudetto-crowning win. I saw Del Piero come through as a promising youngster before growing into the greatest Juventus player and captain. I saw the 1996 Champions League win against an Ajax team full of future legends. I watched us edge out an Inter side that had just signed one of the greatest players ever, saw the final-day Scudetto win in 01/02 unfold live in the most dramatic way possible, the 9 in a row including the fantastic chase down of Napoli thanks to Higuain's last minute winner in the San Siro... I've seen the lows of the relegation, the loss to Perugia on the final day, played on an actual swimming pool in 99/00 to hand Lazio the Scudetto, the 4 CL final defeats, the club treading water till Conte came in...

Back in 2006 (World Cup) when I was a kid, I fell in love with the italian national team and especially Buffon. Since then he's my favorite player of all time and an idol to me. In spite of being a fan of Buffon I never really followed Juve or football in general (I only watched big international tournaments).

6 years forward and I fell in love with the italian national team again during the UEFA Euro 2012. Buffon was still there and the team had a backbone of Juve players.

After the tournament was over I really wanted to follow this team but didn't want to wait for the next international break or tournament, so I decided to follow Juve and started to learn more and more about this beautiful club. This was also the time I started to watch club football in general (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga etc.).

My family is not into football at all, which is weird for an Italian family, and I wasn't living in Italy, so I was able only to see a few National Team matches from time to time as there was no streaming and such at that time.

I remember I had watched the 2003 UCL final as it was on tv but I hadn't seen much else up to then.

I didn’t not enjoy it but I also didn’t have any feelings when they played the game if they won I was like meh 😒 if they lost I wasn’t really bothered. I started watching a bit of Italian football on channel four in the UK. Juventus got to the champions league final the same year against Real Madrid in 1998 I was 9 years old. For the first time In my life I cried over a football result and had that nervous tingly feeling in my stomach during the game. Mijatovic absolutely shattered my heart.

"Early 2000s in Mongolia. We had a cable tv with around 30 chanels. One of the chanel is local ""video"" chanel that broadcast 6 russian dubbed Hollywood movies per day. One day they showed 96-97 Seria A season highlight video. In that video they showed the goals of a stars of the league like Inzaghi, Zamarano and Ronaldo etc. Then comes the Del Piero highlights. He was so smooth and skilled and his goals from left corner of the 16 yard box was just magical. Soon followed a wonderful but bittersweet 2003 champions league run made me fall in love with Juve. 2006 WC was amazing too.

Juventus 4 - 1 Roma. 

I was flipping through channels since we had recently installed new cable company (we rarely had cable at home). I was about 15, when I stumbled on a channel showing the Juve vs Roma game. As soon as I saw soccer I stopped flipping and within seconds Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores an incredible goal vs. Roma. 

I asked myself “who is this white and black team?” Since my dad only spoke of Inter Milan when I was a kid (he loved Ronaldo). 

Here’s the link to the goal that made me fall in love with Juventus

I was a kid back then, 9 years old and just getting into football, so is not like I knew much about that sport other than being a Ronaldinho fan like all of the other kids.

"Great game. Played with intensity and focus. The effect Buffon and Chiellini have on our backline really can't be understated. No hate to Demiral and Tek but we seem a lot more disorganized when they play as opposed to the veterans.

Sandro is decent as the hybrid CB-LB but even though he made some important defensive plays I think it's pretty clear that he needs to be moved on. 

Rabiot and Bentancur both had good games -- did what was asked of them, made few mistakes -- but even when they play well, neither are particularly decisive. I really believe having an actual playmaker with good vision (like Locatelli) will unlock the team's potential. 

Cuadrado was great at RM and really helped our attack flow better. I noticed he moved in centrally a good bit to help out in midfield. It felt like the first time I saw Pirlo's 4-4-2 actually work as intended.

"Really solid game from everyone.

Chiesa is on fire and is really giving some energy to this side. I might even say his passion for winning rivals that of Ronaldo at the moment. Running hard constantly and always anticipating something, even at the back.

Loved seeing everyone celebrate with Dybala after his goal, really emotional seeing everyone run off the bench to meet him before he even got to the corner flag.

Cuadrado continues to dominate that right side and was nice to see him higher up the pitch moving forward again.

Both Bentancur &amp; Rabiot had solid outings with minimal errors, can't complain there.

Everyone at the back was strong and consistent, especially Buffon. 

Chiellini and Morata were the two weak spots today. Also not sure why we keep putting McKennie on the wings, I don't find him particularly effective there. 

I also think Pirlo could have made the subs 5+ minutes earlier to maintain a bit more control, but it ended up being effectively a 2-0 win without the flukey penalty.",gtpx8ef,mm8ruk,Juve,2021-04-08 02:52:14,jbogs7,14

Shout-out to the OG legend Buffon. There were a couple of times Napoli looked really threatening inside the box and Buffon noped the shit out of the attack like that. He made a couple of great saves and was really alert. Was such a treat to watch at the age of 43. My eyes went :') with those saves he made. And he commandered from the back you could hear his voice.

"I think something that's missing from football and VAR is some sort of explanation/justification for decisions. Like in the NFL, when refs give fouls and revert incorrect plays, they always communicate to everyone what is happening and why.

In football, there's no such thing so 100% of the time, we don't get any information on why something might have been called a certain way and the justification for it. 

There's just zero reason for that penalty to be called, anyone with eyes could see that it was simulation. Refs really need to be held accountable for things like this because that's why it's a huge problem to begin with.",gtpv634,mm6xaa,Juve,2021-04-08 02:37:32,jbogs7,13

"If Juve wants to have Ronaldo past next season, then I think they should pursue Zidane. He’s won with Ronaldo and proven he can manage a team that plays with him as the focal point. In order to afford it and give Zidane some money to work with, Dybala will have to go, along with a couple (or many) others.

If Juve is ready to move on from Ronaldo after next season, then I’d rather them bring back Allegri to overhaul the team. Build around de Ligt, Chiesa, potentially Arthur and McKennie, and see if Dybala can return to the La Joya he was under Allegri. Chiellini and Buffon would probably be gone with Ronaldo, if they aren’t already calling it quits at the end of this season. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Bonucci go at the end of his contract as well.

To sum up, if we’re gonna make a run at it with what’s left of Ronaldo’s career, I say go all out and bring in Zidane. If we’re done with the Ronaldo project, I think Allegri would make the most sense to lead an overhaul.",gtnsfso,mlqkwl,Juve,2021-04-07 14:18:26,Sw4gg1n,17

It's something that saddens me a lot.  But to earn that money, not always but often, at Juventus you have to sweat it to get it.

"Sorry to piss on the sub a bit, but we really should take a step back and reflect upon our criticism of the club for a bit. Everyone and their mother on this sub were tearing into the club for contemplating selling Dybala last summer, and for considering buying Lukaku to replace him, calling him a donkey and worse.

Obviously the deal fell through, but the club (including Paratici, Nedved and Agnelli) were right all along. Lukaku is looking like the best number 9 outside of Haaland, Lewa and Benzema in Europe. A true powerhouse striker that can propel the team forward for the next seven or eight years. Inter are laughing all the way to the Scudetto and will probably win a couple more in the years to come. Dybala meanwhile looks like a dead man walking. We will be lucky to secure anywhere near 50m for him, nevermind 70 or 80m. And there is no way we will get anyone as good as Lukaku to replace him.

We really ought to trust the club more.",gtn28qt,mleedv,Juve,2021-04-07 09:38:22,Sputniki,1

Pirlo clearly has lost the players and he cannot impose himself, he cannot scream during matches and has that calm look whatever the result which irritates me. Most probably if he loses to Napoli, he is out before it's too late (IMO it will be too late because we have difficult fixtures in front of us). But it's not only his fault.

The backpasses of Bentancur, Arthur, Kulu, and the continuous errors from Tek. That laugh and handshake of Sandro yesterday when he failed to dribble his opponent. That counter-attack of Morata at the end of the game. And many more mistakes we see every week is another perspective for our abysmal results. There is no concentration, we are a playground!

Shame that covid happened and we dont have the money to build a team and also keep him because he is a true winner and Juventus is a winning team. This season we havent showed that. This year hasnt been a normal year in anything so maybe when things get normal Juventus is back to right track and winning ways. 9 years in row that is something no team has done and it had to end eventually. Tougher times than this has happened and we came back so this isnt world end. Fino alla fine.",gt9mt5a,mjdlvr,Juve,2021-04-04 02:09:51,Shambuktu,8

Every game we play 15 mins overall or truly fall asleep for the first 15 mins of each half.

I really have no idea what our game plan is and where we draw our play from.
There is no concept, no vision, no urgency and no character.
It's the coach's job to induce discipline and hunger for wins. If he cannot achieve that he needs to go. From day one he hasn't been taken seriously and he never will be.
Paratici needs to go too and Agnelli should take a massive smack in the face.
We need a management who is ready for the next level and understand that Juve cannot have an Off season, there can be no breaks in the hunger for winning!

"I know Kulusevski has had his ups and downs and had a bad mistake today, but people need to cut him some slack in general (although I get criticizing him for his mistake) 

he's a 20 year old kid who played wing in a counter attacking system last year 

this year, he's playing in almost a wing/attacking midfield hybrid when he's playing on the same side as Cuadrado, and gets lost in the game.... it's the same problem Dybala had trying to fit into this lineup under Allegri (playing with Ronaldo &amp; Mandzukic), where he would just kind of drift, but make zero impact 

his role/position going forward is one of the many things they need to figure out this summer 

if he's a winger, play him the same way Chiesa is allowed to play.... if he's going to be a midfielder, stick him in the middle of the pitch and let him have the ball at his feet there",gt9nzjy,mjdlvr,Juve,2021-04-04 02:19:21,CaptainRock22,0

If there is one thing I appreciate about Ronaldo is that he is always serious and never gets distracted by things like that.

wtf guys, you can't have this shit both ways...

And before the Ronaldo stans say I hate him, I'm not complaining about *him* I'm complaining about how management handled both situations in totally opposite ways when they both broke covid protocol...

"Just poppin by. I’m a Chelsea fan but I follow this sub because I’m American and McKennie is fun to watch. 


This was more to do with Tuchel than any particular player. Before our downturn in form, Tuchel took this team to the top 4 after consistently being 9th prior to Lampard’s exit. Kante is a great player, but he has struggled all season with form and injuries. Jorginho was also inconsistent before tuchel took over. Kovacic is probably our best midfielder before his injury. All of this to say, yes Juve needs great midfielders but as the contrast between Kante/Jorginho/Kovacic under Lampard vs. Tuchel has shown us, you need a competent, tactical coach first. A great coach will make good players great, and great players legendary.

When Chelsea won back in 2012, they needed massive performances for multiple players. Over the last 10 years, with the Eden hazard era, they have failed in Europe multiple times. Now that they have assembled a more balanced squad, they are getting results in europe. Psg is another example of how you need an entire team performance in europe.

I'm not saying I would be upset if we sign him, in fact I'd be happy to have his quality, but we must look to do this as a signing of the future, not a signing of nostalgia.

"Allegri coached for 5 years and it was time for him to take a break and for Juve to take a break from him. Precisely because I don't have a memory that only goes back to 2 weeks, I remember that Cardiff night and that something that broke down between the two halves of the game, which resulted in us not showing up in the second half. Whatever it was, it stayed with the team for the following 2 years of Allegri at the helm, we just got lucky that there was absolutely no competition. 

He took a team that was hungry and winning under Conte, kept it hungry, and winning through 2 CL finals until something broke down.

IMO, it is a different time and a completely different overall situation. 

If you look at our lineup from 2018/2019 for next year there are just a few in common: 

* Szczesny (will leave if Donnarumma)
* ~~De Sciglio~~
* Chiellini (will not play much)
* ~~Benatia~~
* ~~Pjanic~~
* ~~Khedira~~
* Ronaldo 
* Dybala
* ~~Douglas Costa~~
* Alex Sandro
* ~~Matuidi~~
* ~~Barzagli~~
* Cuadrado
* ~~Mandzukic~~
* ~~Kean~~
* Bonucci
* ~~Cancelo~~
* Pinsoglio (end of contract)
* Perin (unlikely to come back)
* ~~Emre Can~~
* ~~Rugani~~
* Bentancur
* ~~Bernardeschi~~

As you can see the starting players that are still here after he left are not very many at all. And it's even less (Chiellini, Dybala, Sandro, Cuardado, Bonucci-who BTW went to Milan right after) if you take Cardiff into consideration (the second half of which marks the start of our decline, in my opinion). 

To me, the next season has more similarities with Conte's arrival in 2011 than Allegri's 2014.",gzr0prm,nmuum1,Juve,2021-05-28 20:15:38,eleytheria,9

If Verona had not drew with Napoli, the posts on this sub would be massively different, not to say the financial shitstorm juve would  be going through. We need the UCL money, we’re already far behind EPL teams and PSG which is why Agnelli wanted the ESL. With Allegri we get a proven winner in the league who is tactically intelligent. And we get a coach who can take us to the CL final. 

At this rate I’m starting to believe more people remember his dogshit football the final season, than the other positives he brought this team. 2 CL finals, in which one he took a Conte team that “wasn’t good enough” to the final, and in the other year where we only conceded three goals till the final.

Don't forget that, in the year before, Liverpool also lost 3-1 in the final agaisnt Zidane's Madrid, the year after we did. I think you're really underestimating the work done by Allegri during those years and I'm pretty sure we were considered an ""European heavyweight"" before we started going out early in the KO stages agaisnt average sides after he left. I also don't think Zidane has showed enough outside of managing one of the greatest squads of all time to prove that he would have done a better job here than Max. If anything, I would say Allegri is the safest option for us.",gzr6ar6,nmuum1,Juve,2021-05-28 21:07:40,CrazyAnalDischarge,8

"Considering that Pirlo was set to fail when he was appointed to lead Juventus; no proper transfer window, no proper preseason, a joke of an break before heading towards one of, if not the most hard and taxing season mentally and physically the world has seen in decades, and still managing to break the record of unbeatable streak for a new coach in Serie A and bringing in two trophies, he does deserve praise. I'm both happy, and sad to see him go. Thank you Maestro for everything, until we meet again.",gzqprjg,nmu2iv,Juve,2021-05-28 18:00:39,GreatKrakenus,108

"On the bright side he could not have had a better start to his managing career, save winning the league of course. He's got a good resume to show around now and I wouldn't be surprised to see him bounce back at another club, even if not immediayely at a top level one like Juve, but still clubs of the calibre of Lazio, Roma, etc should be within his reach. 

The club (Juve) gave him a boost to his start in the managerial world, there is no denying this, so they are not exactly doing him wrong by sacking him, although I would have preferred that he stayed. I hope on a few years he is experienced enough to come back and stay around for many years.",gzqrn42,nmu2iv,Juve,2021-05-28 18:27:39,dwdm83,13
"Regardless of your thoughts about this year, it took massive balls for a brand new coach to take on this role. He brought us UCL qualification and 2 trophies in a year where Serie A was massively competitive and he almost matched Sarri’s point total that won us the league.

"Honestly, this makes me sad. Not only because I loved Pirlo as a player and as a Juve legend. He had the guts to accept the job, and in the end he managed to somewhat salvage a season that was edging toward complete disaster. 

This season was quite negative, but honestly what else could we have expected from a newbie manager who was given the toughest managing job in Italy? It was a mistake by the club management to give him the  job in a really delicate moment for the team, with the winning cycle coming to an end, the need to rebuild from almost zero and all the hardships that this crazy covid season entailed. Despite having some horrible moments and really poor displays, in the end Pirlo managed to unite the squad after the 3-0 against AC that would have broken the spirit of more experienced managers. He lead us to the Cup and the UCL qualification, which a month ago seemed almost impossible. More than anything, despite all the cursing he got out of me throughout the season, I appreciated the love and attachment he showed for our great club.

Good luck to one of my favorite players ever, I think that a team like Sassuolo would fit for him as a growing experience. And then who knows, in a few years we could welcome him back and begin a new journey together!",gzqq6ls,nmu2iv,Juve,2021-05-28 18:06:46,dre193,26

The thing the board did was to make fool of Andrea Pirlo. First of all what the Juve hierarchy was thinking when they appointed a man with no coaching pedigree.. to miraculously win trophies. Even managers with years of experience cannot do the job properly. Despite of that he won 2 trophies and beat many big teams.

"Sad that it ended like this and so soon, but it's the right decision if we can get Allegri in, and I'm glad Pirlo can still walk out with his head held high after winning 2 trophies and qualifying for Europe (despite needing a favour from Hellas).

Inconsistencies more often than not led us to 4th in the League. I think the Coppa Italia final was a true testament to his backing of the players and having them believe in themselves when it matters in a ""cup final"". 

In other moments like the inter loss and ac Milan loss (at home!) were on him. His sides didn't show up.

"I'm trying to see the glass half full. Watching his last season was painful, in fact I rarely watched any game. BUT he can also make the team play decently: remember when he set the 4-2-3-1 for a while? I'm hoping that is still possible and that idea sunk because the men he had weren't suitable for that anymore (like pjanic not wanting to run and such).

Overall I'm disappointed, I would have kept Pirlo. His ideas were good, the team rooted for him, and hr gained some experience that would have shined within a second season, an actual pre-season preparation and with buying him players he need. I had much more fun in the last game of coppa italia than in a whole season of allegri... let's wait and see, I hope Pirlo could come back one day if he becomes the coach he hinted he could be.

I'm also curious about this new manager figure that allegri will have, it's something new for Italy and it's very interesting to see if it could work like it did in England.",gzoq29f,nmf670,Juve,2021-05-28 05:37:42,Matt_J_Dylan,4

well then why didnt just give that to him back then???!

"I really don’t understand this narrative. It just seems to me that people convinced themselves of this and that’s it. Go ahead and actually watch Real Madrid’s games against Chelsea, and their last game in La Liga. Where is this amazing football everyone talks about?

This is not a criticism of Real or Zidane, but I fundamentally don’t understand what exactly do people think football should look like. Every team has some good games and some bad.

Real-Juve 2018, Inter-Juve 2018, Juve-Atletico 2019, Juve-Napoli 2016. Juve-Real Allegri’s first year, and many many more were some of the most entertaining games in the last decade.

Allegri was adaptive. If the game needed attacking football, he would play so. If it needed shutdown, he would play so. I really don’t understand this weird obsession with some thought of football that frankly, doesn’t really exist.

You can’t just think of a way to play and make it happen. It has to fit your team’s players, budget, management, philosophy, domestic league. You just can’t play what people dream of in Serie A.

"&gt;The management had a vision, and it feels like they're not willing to commit to the rebuild. 

One thing is to commit, another one is to see the cliff and still go in that direction. We have committed, we have failed, time to save things if we can.  

You don't realize it, but we have risked so much by not qualifying for CL. We literally can't afford to do that again, we are already losing a lot of money and we simply can't afford to lose even more.

The man mistake was getting rid of something which was working and was giving good results (Allegri's team). Things have started going badly when we have moved to this ""project"" instead of following that path. So getting Allegri back and realizing it was a mistake to sack him is the first step to get us back on track towards the right direction.  
We have to keep rebuilding, we need midfielders now and to keep rejuvenating the team, but with a competent, proven, world class manager at the wheel, not a rookie or an idea of football which is not implementable with our squad.

&gt;Simione or Allegri

They have literally nothing in common, Simeone is a defensive coach, Allegri is a pragmatic coach, completely different things

&gt;I'm not sure how many players will be attracted to Juventus when they're playing Catenaccio once again

We have literally never done that. In fact, our games were boring because our opponents were usually giving up on trying to score against us, and they were closing back in defense.

It just proves that Sarri was a mistake, and that Pirlo was a last ditch effort to rectify their plan that was elaborated following Allegri's departure by allowing a year of reconstruction.

On the other hand - with Allegri we likely won't ever be in trouble of making it to top 4 (which is HUGELY important) hence falling into a banter era.

"Alright, let me clarify after being bombarded with hate for this thread. I never claimed that Conte and Guardiola played the same system, rather alluding to them playing a more visually interesting football style.

Yes, I do watch matches and have done so for as long as I can remember. That being under Conte, Allegri, Sarri and Pirlo. Including cup games, CL and even the preseason friendlies. 

I never wanted to say that Allegri or Simione played the same football either, but no one call tell me otherwise that they are playing defensive football. Trust me, I know. 

I never supported the sacking of Allegri, of course, I wouldn't. He did brilliantly, but I still like the idea of playing more \*visually interesting football\*.

This is a discussion, I'm trying to spark dialogue, as people do agree with the fact they don't want Allegri back. 

I'm irritated by the fact we're going back on our decisions, not that I hate the man or deny his success at the club. I love Allegri, and always will. But, this isn't a good view on the club, on a clubs management already under a lot of stress and pressure due to the Super League. Going back and returning to an old manager isn't the right way to go IMO. Get this, In my opinion.

I really didn't think Sarri 'sucked', he did what he was supposed to do; score more goals. He didn't do well, don't get me wrong. And I really don't think even Allegri could have won against this Inter side. They stacked up with winners, and ex-Juve players afterall.

I'm saying we don't have enough grinta, but the last few games I've seen hunger; and typically a manager needs another season with a squad before they start to settle. I never support the idea of sacking a manager after a single season. Especially when we made CL.

I think allegri whole success was because conte left a good built and ready team then he lost control just like milan, if allegri succeded right now then i will admit he is a good manager.


Do not till me that i did not warn you all but Now you have to wait for another 2 seasons because allegri of course wants to start from scratch and build a new team that mostly will fail.",gzpb8go,nm73nq,Juve,2021-05-28 08:33:42,maybeImportantFella,0
"Allegri has played boring football in his last 2 years because the team had gotten worse and lacked quality, especially in midfield. So the only way to win was to play defensive style.  
  
This is something I only realized later, in fact I was among those who wanted him to be fired. But now I'm very glad he's back",gzmv1jj,nm5zex,Juve,2021-05-27 21:34:48,123ciao,39
"This isn’t gonna be the last time this subject comes up. 

I think the first problem is that people just wanna divide it into you’re either an attacking team or a defensive team. Allegri, at least initially, was all about balance. We could defend and attack properly. As the team declined he leaned more and more on that reliable defense. 

We don’t know what his version of this team will look like but if he’s leaning on too much on the defense to get us results it’s going to be bad. Besides the fact that it’s boring, our defense isn’t as good as it used to be. The mix of talent and chemistry we had at the back for years isn’t quite there anymore. We probably need to properly utilize our attacking talent if we want to win games with this squad. 

All of which is to say, Allegri can play how he likes as long as he wins but if we’re seeing that full on park the bus from the very start, it would be a sign that he really doesn’t like the squad hes working with and we need to improve a lot. That way isn’t sustainable, but if we sign Locatelli and maybe one or two others I think people would be surprised at the quality of football we can produce under Allegri.

I recently went back and watched that 2015 semifinal vs Madrid first leg. We were playing some very nice football in addition to defending beautifully.",gzmmjc4,nm5zex,Juve,2021-05-27 20:19:38,jct1121,44

Napoli isn’t going to win the Scudetto with Spaletti.

The squad had obvious deficiencies, Inter have gone balls out to win the Scudetto this year (to the point they're gonna be fucked for a good few years after), a better coach might have finished 2nd with this squad... But what difference does it make? Maybe this season was the slap in the face to wake up the front office staff?

Pirlo can walk out with his head high in my opinion, he hasn't ruined the reputation he earned as a player which is what I was worried about when he was given the job.

Allegri should never have been sacked unless to appoint a genuine top 3 in the world coach, or to appoint a highly-rated young coach like Tuchel, Nagelsmann or Pochettino who would get management backing to transition the team into its next incarnation.

"I really don't know what I feel about this. I don't like the cycle of sacking coaches after 1 season and I am disappointed that we didn't give Zidane a shot since he is no longer a rma manager. I didn't like Pirlo because he made some really stupid decisions and his formation sucked, the management is at fault for hiring him in the first place but at the same time I felt that pirlo was getting a hold of this team as we won must win matches against sassuolo, inter, atalanta and bologna (who would have taught that we would win all of the matches) and many of the goals we conceded were due to the error of our players in which pirlo cannot be blamed. In the end I feel really sorry for pirlo because the management put him in this situation.

As far a allegri is concerned I have mixed reaction, people tend to forget that the loss to ajax was completely on him but at the same time I think that he did the best that he could with the players at his disposal. Tbh we can't play attacking football with high intensity with Ronaldo. Our best moments of this season came when we defended as a unit and counter attacked with the likes of Ronaldo, chiesa and morata. With allegri we scored more goals and conceded less with players like matuidi, khedira, bentancur. It's exciting to see what allegri does with this squad especially since our squad is wayyy better that the squad allegri coached in his final year.

Well, Inter is still in deep financial troubles. They got a loan but how are they going to repay it?  
If they sell 2 key players, without Conte, next year they won't make top 4, they'll lose even more money, and get into a death spiral.
  
Not that I would mind, obviously.

I thought they would have sold the club honestly, but right now it's too late, there's really no time to sell the club AND allow the buyer to inject cash into the club to make signings or keep the team afloat.

He has always brought us players, and when it's time he decides to move them. We know that, we accept that, and when it's time we let the player move (for the right price). And Raiola knows we allow him to do so, so he gladly brings us the players.

If Donnarumma comes, we know he won't be here for 15 years. He'll stay for 3 years, maybe 4, and then he's getting sold for 30m or whatever somewhere else, nice plusvalenza for us and Raiola earns his money.

If Juve maintains a good relationship with Raiola, they could end up getting a massive plusvalenza in the future. I doubt Donnarumma would do a Nedved and stay loyal to Juve.

"The club is run like a corporation, Paratici did a horrible job these last few years, the sacking was inevitable 

Hard pill to swallow, but the CR7 transfer under Paratici, can actually be considered the main reason the team is so inconsistent right now 

It was a great marketing play but Juventus is nowhere near financially strong enough to support such a signing without suffering immensely on all other transfers 

Had we not gotten CR7, we probably wouldn't have gambled on Ramsey or Rabiot and we probably wouldn't have crushed Dybalas confidence by sidelining him 

I wouldn't be surprised if CR7 is the next one to leave, I feel like a good reason why Agnelli pulled the trigger on canning Paratici is because CR7 confided his willingness to leave and if that's the case, considering what we gained with his transfer, it's a huge flop that no one wants to admit",gzj0peb,nlga3d,Juve,2021-05-27 00:01:32,dudeinred69,-1

Allegri could come but what says he won't keep an eye on RM? For all we know Zidane could stay then leave mid season. Having a manager who's attention is on two jobs is not the best thing.

"Question is: replace him with *who*?

Changing for the 3rd time in 3 years is a mess, the new coach needs time to work with the team so it's not a given to win again for a buttload of reasons, and, again: who?

Zidane and allegri are great to handle the men, but not great coaches overall: they don't have a defined idea like say sarri or guardiola, they just roll with what they've been given. Sure they are great coaches, but not what we need if we want to really step up our game. Gasperini doesn't work in great teams because of how he is: he would turn everyone against him in a metter of months. Gattuso, Inzaghi or the others aren't really a step up above pirlo either.

So, unless you can pick Guardiola or Klopp and five them time and money, is there even a point in changing again? Remember, those 2 didn't won anything in the beginning with their teams, they were criticized and still needed hundred of millions before giving the people what they wanted. Especially klopp had a start very similar to pirlo, but then he stood the test of time because... well... he was given time to work. Not saying it's the same with pirlo, but he could use some more time in a situation like this, when there's no one around to really be an improvement. Sending him away means wasting this whole year.

"Anyone who hasn't lowered their standards dramatically would say he should go. 

Going from 1st to barely scraping 4th and losing to Porto just isn't good enough. Coppa Italia win is great but if a Scudetto wasn't good enough for Sarri, then i don't see why Pirlo should stay, though Sarri lost the dressing room. Regardless, a Coppa Italia is nothing compared to a Scudetto. A couple of decent games at the end is not justifiable for all the points we lost and all the embarrassing performances and results.",gz7yis0,nji8vz,Juve,2021-05-24 08:24:16,Mister_Allegri,-2

"Rabiot, Kulu, Dybala, Chiesa finding their form again and we are up and running :) I have high expectations for Kulu, he has looked tremendous in the last few games. We just need to find stability to our midfield, i would 100% keep Rabiot and bring in De Paul and Locatelli so Pirlo can start working his magic. I would also keep hold of Morata just because we are short on cash (most likely). We need to have realistic expectations for the upcoming transfer market with Covid messing shit up and Pirlo needs to nurture Mckennie back to life. All in all, we have a really young promising squad that needs time to gel together and grow both mentally and physically. If we can't get a top tier manager (Klopp, Zizou, Allegri) I would certainly keep Pirlo and let him build on this years' foundations.",gz9cjqe,njh22e,Juve,2021-05-24 18:44:03,SirHenryy,2

"I love this win and the game we played today. Sadly juve always does these amazing games once in a while then we cant carry the momentum to the next game. I feel like by now the management and pirlo should realize how bad our midfield is. There hasn't been any compatability in our midfield which is why ours is the weakest in the top 5 flight in seria a and europe is different story.

I would love cris to stay I want to see him more with chiesa the pair has carried us all season it would be even better with dybala starting next season. I hope we fix our midfield. Forza Juve champions will be fun now.",gz7adlo,njgp98,Juve,2021-05-24 04:57:51,StrawHat_ktk,4

Look, I love the guy, I think he would do well for Juve given he's mentally satisfied in the club, but this stalemate is going nowhere.

To put things in perspective, Ronaldo is earning 30m, and Ramsey and Rabiot are on roughly 7 millions each.  
Dybala is also our most marketable player by far, excluding Ronaldo obviously.

This will be his last opportunity to get a large contract anywhere, so obviously those are his demands. Personally I think we should renew him, we won't find a proper replacement and if we do, he's going to demand the same wages plus a large fee (players like Dybala are EXPENSIVE).",gz1r8kz,nih9go,Juve,2021-05-22 20:16:40,Starbuck1992,29

"The following are just my personal opinion, including how likely it will be for me:
- Szczesny: If Donnarumma will join us, we might sell Tek (6/10)
- Buffon: will leave, but as a free agent/retire (9.5/10)
- Chiellini: personnaly thinking that he will stay, but there are rumours (5/10)
- Bonucci: slight chance, but I don't see him being sold (3/10)
- Demiral: he might have to be sold for the cash, sadly (6.5/10)
- Alex Sandro: I don't think so (3/10)
- Bentancur: as bad hate as he played, I guess he'll stay (4/10)
- Rabiot: would bring in cash, so a quite possible move, quite some interest (6.5/10)
- Ramsey: I feel like he wants to leave, the club doesn't want him (7.5/10)
- Arthur: honestly no idea (6/10)
- Ronaldo: my guts tell me he'll stay (4/10)
- Dybala: don't think he'll go (3/10)",gyvkajj,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 06:12:15,fbnrgt,9
"Lots of it depends on two major things: whether we make top 4 and whether Pirlo stays.

I think the players who'd leave regardless are Buffon (confirmed), Ramsey and Bernardeschi, the latter two since they are clearly surplus to requirements under any coach.",gyx6u0c,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 16:11:33,WW_Jones,3
"Definitely (hopefully):
-Ramsey
-Alex Sandro
-Bentacur

Maybe 
-CR7 (could negotiate a free transfer with the Juve board)
-Dybala (lol this is a complicated scenario that requires more explanation)
-Rabiot (he seems to be well liked)
-Bonucci (a very hard maybe; most likely will stay)
-Demiral (for $$$ reasons and because he is injury prone and hasn't appeared for us much)

These are not based on how I feel about the players, but from my feeling about the financial situation of Juventus currently.

Also, Buffon will most likely not be sold. He was on a 1-year contract so he is going to be a free agent after Sunday.",gyvcyll,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 05:16:06,neil_ny,6

"GKs

Well Buffon has already announced he will leave, so that's one done and dusted for sure. Szczesny probably will stay even if Donnaruma comes, it'd be good to have two world class stoppers for every competition. Perin to leave hopefully, he is a starter now and would feature little I think even in a rotating squad at Juve.

Defenders

The club will probably try to sell De Sciglio and Rugani who are away on loan but enjoying their time at their respective clubs. Atalanta has an option to buy Romero too. Therefore I think we will cling on to any and every defenders that are present in the lineup right now. I don't see either Danilo or Sandro leaving as they are experienced unless a world class player come in to replace them.

Mids

Ramsey and Arthur are most likely to leave imo. Ramsey as he is at an age where it'd be harder to sell him later on, and the chances look good now with a few clubs supposedly interested. Arthur as he has played so little and may be useful if involved in a swap deal if possible. Rabiot to stay because he is good, and we need depth. It'd be hard to sell him along with Ramsey and Arthur or any other midfielder and not need a replacement.

Attackers

Morata is not sure to have his loan renewed. 
I hope Dybala and Ronaldo are staying, especially if Morata leaves.",gyvt26h,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 07:25:01,dwdm83,1
"Aside from Cr7 who’s 100% gone if we miss CL and possibly if we make CL.

It’s going to depend on who we can swap players with. Teams still don’t have money, you won’t see many deals of us selling players for straight cash. It’ll be mostly swap deals like the Pjanic-Arthur deal. The most popular candidates are probably Rabiot and Dybala.",gyvwc7w,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 07:53:17,thefonzz91,1
"Ronaldo is gone, in my eyes, whether we qualify for the UCL or not. Believe it or not, i think he’d do it for the betterment of the team as well, he knows that we cannot afford to provide the right players for him. 

Ramsey is gone, IF someone would like to take his contract. 

Dybala is a maybe for me, i know he loves the team, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Juve tried to sell him and he accepted somewhere else. 

Sandro is a most likely for me. After hearing the rumours of Gosens coming here, i really hope we can sell Sandro for at least $15m. 

Bentancur is a maybe for me, but i really hope we sell him. He may succeed somewhere else, but i dont see him improving any further at Juve. 

Rabiot is also a maybe, but only because i feel like the club can make a nice chunk of profit on him. However, i really hope we dont sell him. 

Chiellini is probably going to retire. 

Apparently the Donnarumma/AC Milan talks are going poorly according to the rumours(however believable/unbelievable they are, and if he comes here i could definitely see us selling Szczesny. I dont think we’ll get much for him, but even if we get $25m for him, its a good deal to me. 

I think im obviously being overly-optimistic, but im also hopeful that we can have a really good summer transfer window. Lord knows we need it.",gyvr7yz,nhb1gc,Juve,2021-05-21 07:09:24,BlackenedPS4,0

"Hello everyone, and first off congratulations to all of us Juventini, Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, and everyone at Juventus FC for the Coppa Italia.

It was a good way to cap off our underwhelming season, regardless of what happens on gameweek 38 vs. Bologna.

I'd like to come out here with a small debate/comment on Dejan Kulusevski.

I've mentioned it on my Twitter (@haythamatics shameless plug right there, sue me) - that Dejan isn't good enough for Juve, I cringed when I saw him in last night's starting XI and really expected the worst.

He showed up with a goal + Assist.

I'm taking a slice of humble pie for this one. A good night on a cup final doesn't change much, but...but... I'll concede and change my view and say give him another season. If Juve will play Europa League (likely) next season, I think that will also be a good platform for him to perform in on a not so elite European stage, hopefully to evolve into someone that's adaptable to elite level game.

Your thoughts? 

Cheers, and once again congratulations everyone. I'm so f*cking happy we won last night. Love you all.",gysewgo,nggsil,Juve,2021-05-20 13:09:54,SirMosesKaldor,1

"Unrealistically: Toni Kroos, Joshua Kimmich, Pogba, Marcos Llorente, or de Bruyne 

Realistically: De Paul, Ruslan Malinovskyi, Joan Jordan, Locatelli, Aouar, or Milinkovic-Savic

We need a proper regista in the midfield to support the strikers because the midfielders we have lack creativity, passing, crossing, and vision. Pogba, Pirlo, and Pjanic had those attributes and it showed because they managed around 10 or more assists. Look at the “Unrealistic” midfielders I was talking about, they all have 10 or more assists this season because they have all those attributes. 

Bentacur or Arthur is meant to be our regista but  Bentacur is very inconsistent and Arthur doesn’t have any vision",gylagah,nfdcwf,Juve,2021-05-19 01:13:25,alevico,6

"Are we going age? Like can I choose Pirlo in his prime or is it current players?

Also what formation are we running? Sticking with 442?

442 is kind of weird to pick one CM as we'll have sort of an imbalance but if possible I'd pick a 41212 diamond and have a distributor playing CDM. A Pogba there would be great too simply because of his physicality. I'd then get a Foden to play CAM with dybala and CR7 up front

If we can only get one I'd actually love to try this (I've done it in FIFA with Piemonte lol) but go diamond and have Bonnucci as CDM with a Foden up front (I usually use Dybala) and have the formation switch to 352 with Bonnucci dropping back and the FBs moving forward when I'm in ultra attacking and going 5311 when going ultra defense.

Went off topic here but there are a lot of guys to pick. I'd also love a Jadon Sancho. I think pairing him with Chiesa would make our wings insane. 4231 with CR7 up front, Dybala behind and Chiesa and Sancho wide with whoever as the deeper lying 2 would be good with me",gyl048u,nfdcwf,Juve,2021-05-19 00:03:04,huskytogo,2

"Listen, CR7 is a finisher. His goal production is not a joke by any stretch of debate. We need to stop the silly debate around him being finished (in serie a) because he'll easily contribute 15+ goals with his quality.

And now the but - he was unnecessary for us to win serie a two seasons ago and will be unnecessary for us to challenge for it seasons to come if we get another cheaper but quality striker. We won 7 scudetti without him. Putting the commercials aside he was acquired (fortuitously) because it was thought he was the final piece of puzzle needed to win UCL.

If he left for a decent transfer fee plus the wage slack should allow the club to make the necessary moves in our weak areas. But let it be said, if he leaves there HAS to be a plan for replacement otherwise we'll be crying we don't have a finisher for the bazillion chances our new fantasy midfield will be creating.",gybyx5b,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-16 23:19:35,Naemus,13
"* I haven't seen any really since the Milan defeat, but I don't actually understand anyone who still has faith in Pirlo, he's proven that he has absolutely no clue what his best 11 is or where they play best, alla 37 different orientations and an over reliance on a Rabiot Benta double pivot that everyone else realises doesn't work.
* Defo need **better** midfielders (not sure who tbh), much more creativity is needed since all our attacking comes from the wings. It would also be nice to have a holding midfielder who can actually get the ball forward and doesn't spend 10 seconds panicking before an inevitable back or sidewards pass.
* Ronaldo is positive in that he brings 20+ goals a season guaranteed, but otherwise I'm not sure. Can't help but feel like dropping his wage and the fee we'd get for him would be more beneficial in the long run since I'm not overly confident he'll stay after his contract is up.
* I'd easily make the argument that when he's actually in the defensive third Sandro makes **a lot** of key goal stopping challenges and his biggest issues are often when he pushes forward into the middle third, I'd lowkey be happy to see him converted into a CB. As for Tek, well I wouldn't pick him over Buffon tbh, he's not a bad goalie but he's really starting to feel like the backup, which isn't good with the legend leaving after this season, with Donnarumma up for grabs I wouldn't mind a change behind the posts but I guess it's arguably the lowest priority. On that note though Sam Johnstone (West Brom's keeper) has been great this season despite his side being relegated and some of the Prem boys are ready to snatch him up, I don't think it'd be a bad shout for us to put our hats in the ring.",gyd9s1t,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-17 05:13:03,Wolf_Todd,6
"At least what I gather is that Pirlo is not ready for this job. And that we need a class creative midfielder as we are drowning in mediocre b2b ones.

Personally I think Tek is decent enough and that's not a pushing issue. Ronaldo is a great, but we lack the player that suits him. Still, banging in nearly 30 a Season is immense.

Would love to see Locatelli in bianconero but he is still pretty young and has only one great season under his belt. So that would be a bit of a bet again.",gybpmjy,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-16 22:00:46,AndAgainIForgotMyP,10
"Fabrizio romano is saying allegri had meetings with real madrid this week. Honestly that makes me feel really salty since hes one of the few that could quickly bring solidarity back to the team. I genuinely dont believe zidane can help a struggling juve side. He had a prime midfield  feeding prime ronaldo, plus a clutch benzema. This juve doesnt have that. 

Edit: 
realistically, if juve keeps pirlo, lets look at the glass half full scenario: 

Pirlo improves since he had a whole fucking season to improve, and has the summer to rebuild. However, in this case, i can see him qualifying for the champions league this time with a better midfield, BUT i dont see him challenging conte. Notice how i said conte and not inter. Inter itself is very weak, and conte is what propels them, but im hearing that conte might leave since he sniffs financial trouble with inter and cant get his demands",gybzv5a,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-16 23:27:08,LlamaTurd,3

"For me, any kind of change needs to start with the decision making people. They're the ones that are responsible for our squad. They are also the ones who wanted Pirlo as a coach. I honestly believe that he could be (and still could be) a good to great coach. If you listen to everybody who played with him you'll hear the same thing, should be great coaching  material. But he was thrown before the wolves without any experience. The guys in charge probably believed in the same story as Zidane at Real, the only difference was that Real had a great midfield and Ronaldo in his prime. This was not the case for Pirlo.. Honestly you would really be incompetent as a manager not to do anything good with a team that Zidane had at his disposal.  So now they probably burned Pirlo and we lost a year of rebuilding. And I dont think Zidane is going to be the answer.

When they are gone, and that needs to happen sooner rather than later. Then we need a coach, a top tier coach a top tier in rebuilding coach. Send Pirlo out to get some experience, try to do it as gentle and respectfull as possible, so that maybe he wants to come back someday.

Then the squad. I think that quiet a lot of players really didnt show up this season. I believe in their talents, so everybody can stay,.. but I would still send out feelers for almost every player. Just to see if there is a team wanting to pay the good price.

Starting with Tek, I believe hes a good keeper, but wordclass? Not so sure after this season. So if a decent bid came in, sell him. Otherwise keep him, but start to look for a promising young keeper that can learn and eventually in a season of 2 can take over.

Keep Demiral, Deligt, Bonucci and try to keep Chiellini, but if he wants to play a full season somewhere, let him go he has deserved it! If Chiello leaves, find a experience back up (a barzagli type ;)). Focus should be demiral/deligt in 4-4-2 with bonucci as back up. 3-5-2, bonucci can play. Sell the backs, Sandro was promising but it's not always there. Danilo had a good season, but will he have another? Also ask the coach which formation he wants to play...

Try to sell everybody except Fagioli. If possible sent out Betancur on loan. I never was a fan, but the previous seasons he did show good stuff, so maybe in a good midfield, where the others do their tasks he can excel,... Keep Kulusevski and chiesa.

In front keep Dybala and try to keep Morata. Not only because he is a decent player, but for his Grinta, for his desire to be a juve player,... Lastly, imo sell Ronaldo. He still is one of the best if not the best player around. But he costs so much money and at the moment we could use that for rebuilding. We need to start to look for a team without a super star. Try and build a cohesive squad, with our money and staying talent that should be enough to win the serie A. IF you have that, then you can look to add a superstar to give that extra push for the Champions League.",gyf50dk,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-17 15:32:17,GuidoBenzo,2
"* Idk if Allegri is the one we should go with, but Pirlo needs to go. He's not ready to coach a big team yet. 
* Yes, we do need some some new midfielders. If we don't make the Champions League we are not going to be able to get a big player, so the most realistic target might be Locatelli. We need to sell some players as well, but I think the top priority should be getting rid of Bentacur and Ramsey. 
* Ronaldo has been a mix of positives and negatives for us. For the first two seasons I would definitely say he was a positive but this last season he's more of a negative. Idk if he has declined with age or his heart is just not in it for the team anymore but this season there were many games where he disappeared. If he leaves at the end of the season I won't be upset.
* Tek is not good enough for us. He may be a better technical shot stopper, but Buffon was definitely the better keeper for us. Buffon might have played in less important games, but it's clear we played better and were more organized. I would love to get rid of Tek, but with Buffon leaving us and the possibility that we might not make the Champions League I don't think we have a shot signing a better keeper.
* I think Alex Sandro is still good enough for us. Sure he has made mistakes but he also has some brilliant games. He probably has another decent season in him, but I don't think we should be thinking about selling him unless we have another top LB in the works. 
* Honestly I think our biggest issue is our players' attitude. There were too many games this season where they played with complete apathy. They had no hunger to win and it seemed like they were only out there to cash a check. The motivation of players ideally would be completely on the shoulders of the players, but when they are lacking it's up to the coach to provide that motivation. I think this is where Pirlo failed the most because this is the one aspect were he could have excelled despite having no experience.",gybyzi9,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-16 23:20:05,ladygagafan1237,3

Sure we are fighting for CL qualification, but our xPTS stats show we would be a very tight 2nd to Atalanta. The only reason Inter, AC Milan, and Napoli are ahead of us is because they have been outperforming what the stats would expect of them in terms of goalkeeping and finishing whereas we have been slightly underperforming in terms of finishing. Yes, we 100% need a rejuvenated midfield. Isco would be a fantastic signing in my opinion. Ronaldo should leave as quickly as possible. According to the stats, Tek has been doing alright. He hasn't been underperforming his xGA and I think Alex Sandro is a very strong player when he's on it.",gyhbzmc,ndovfs,Juve,2021-05-18 03:21:57,oldblue2021,1

He intentionally sticks his leg to create real contact and from what we can see, his fall would've been inevitable. Is it a penalty? Yes because Perisic impedes his movement (even though he didn't do much), the rulebook is clear: it has to be a penalty regardless of the fact Cuadrado created the circumstances of the fall.  Is it cynical? Yes, looking for a penalty isn't nice for the receiving side  but looking at our standings, desperate calls for desperate measures.

"It takes a special kind of idiot to watch this game and think that Juve were favoured by the referee and that poor little Inter were ""robbed"".

Their first goal came from a ridiculously lucky penalty in a situation where they had no chance what so ever to score. They were basically gifted a goal in a situation where Juve were already in control of the ball and the attack was over. It was a penalty for sure, but the reason it happened was pure bad luck from De Ligt and the goal was completely undeserved seeing how the game was shaping up (they had only had one shot all game until then).

Then Bentancur gets sent off completely unfairly and Juve have to play with one man less for almost 40 fucking minutes, which means Inter get a multitude of chances to score and finally do so. Both their goals were completely undeserved.

It's truly mindboggling how someone could watch this game and come to the conclusion that Inter were ""robbed"" or that it was unfair that Juve won. I think the average Inter fan must have some sort of brain damage that makes them think they are a victim in every single situation, that nothing is their fault, and that no situation is ever lucky for them, since it's always everyone else that's lucky and got an undeserved break. Not even after winning the fucking league are they able to crawl out of their own asses.",gy9hb2y,nd54u4,Juve,2021-05-16 06:35:09,Krankelibrankelfnatt,24

"It's hard to judge this game properly since Inter has already won the league and they've got nothing to play for except sticking it to Juve.

Terrible officiating, no consistency at all except for the fact that both teams were given soft penalties. Gave cards for very soft tackles, and none for harsh ones. It felt confusing watching so I imagine the players had no idea what would and wouldn't be called.

Huge game for Cuadrado, De Ligt, Rabiot, and Chiellini (outside of the fouls). De Ligt and Chiellini consistently shut down the Lukaku/Lautaro duo. It felt great to see how aggressive De Ligt was to Lautaro. When they are on, they're absolute rocks. The players showed the grinta that should have been there for the whole season. 

Decent tactics although Bentancur should have been off earlier. He consistently neuters himself with bad, early yellow cards. I'm sure we would have seen Dybala on for Kulu if Bentancur didn't get the red card. It was good that we brought off Chiesa for Demiral. Morata for Ronaldo was also needed. These are the types of subs Pirlo should have been making from the start of the season.

All we wanted was to watch a fair entertaining match and the ref fucked it up. Bentacur did not deserve a red but once I saw that I new inter was gonna get a red card or concede a penalty but I wasn’t expecting both.

"Not a bad performance but surely not a perfect one either: they have to press, to run much more and to stop going back to the gk every time. If they let Inter do what they want just like Sassuolo did especially in the first half, they'll be destroyed in the first 20 minutes. Today, Dybala confirmed to be essential for the team, Kulu in his real position is amazing, Ronaldo remembered who he is and Rabiot did a fantastic job. Pains me to say this, but Arthur still isn't used to his new team even though his role is much needed.

"Ffs you clowns. I’m talking to you, Ronaldo plastics. Tattoo the following statement in your minds:

Legitimately criticising a player for on-field performances is not “hate”, and it’s ludicrously easy to tell the difference.

I know a lot of you ejaculate daily onto your 10 x 8 glossy photograph of Ronaldo, but I’m a Juventino and as fond of Ronaldo as I am, Juve always comes first. Above any player.

I visit this subreddit daily and read virtually all the comments. How many comments, in the last month or two have been hateful of Ronaldo? None. 

If you want to have a conversation about Ronaldo’s legacy, or current situation at Juve, then fine, but stop using words like “hate”. It completely diminishes the actual meaning of hatred. Or telling people what they should or shouldn’t do.",gxu3y2y,na7gpq,Juve,2021-05-12 18:00:20,Lord_Maul,33

Ronaldo came here 3 years ago with the aim of winning the champions league...and yes according to me that 2018/19 was the best chance that Juve had to win the champions league...A perfect comeback from atletico Madrid but just failed to get past against ajax...But Ronaldo's contribution has been great for Juventus till now...he have turned around matches for Juve many times.. Obviously Ronaldo is not in his prime years anymore..but according to me he is still one of the best players playing this game..how many 35+ players have you seen who are being top scorer of a league..it's not that often for sure... Expectations are always high when players like Ronaldo and Messi enters the field...Juve wanted champions league and they bought Ronaldo but Ronaldo alone cannot bring UCL right? Real Madrid won UCL 3 times in a row and I won't be wrong to say that Ronaldo was obviously one of the reasons...The support he got from that madrid midfield was different level..but I really see that's missing in Juve...Just if they had more fast and creative midfield I could have seen Juve somewhere in a good position now..Ronaldo..that man regardless has been scoring in and out for Juve..and it's not good at all to put all the blame on him...He is the man who is at the right place at the right time...,gxu00f1,na7gpq,Juve,2021-05-12 16:57:09,Reus_2310,5

"He has a lot of potential, a great left footed shot and can be tricky when needed.

"He's been misused by Pirlo for the majority of the season (more than some of our other younger players). Objectively, he's had a bad season, but he won the best young player award last season for a reason.

If we sell him, I think we will regret it. There's a reason as well that the club has said they don't want to accept any offers for him. Unfortunately, a lot of fans aren't open-minded and don't see it this way.

"I am amongst the few people that still believe in Kulu, and still, protect him.

Going so far as to buy a kit with him on the back, as that's how much I'm willing to bet on his potential. 

He has an incredible left foot, with a deadly curve on it. His finesse shots are incredible.

His right foot is not present, I've seen him for Parma, and he used it then for some reason, so I'm not sure what happened. The most likely cause is loss of confidence. 

He's a very 'lanky' player. He's not very agile and has very peculiar body movements, but he's really good on the ball. Great ball control and knows where it is, but because of his height and stature he's never going to a Chiesa or Dybala type dribbler. 

He's playing wildly out of a position, I see a lot of people saying 'play him like De Bruyne' over and over again. But, he's not exactly there yet. He would be a DEADLY winger in a 433, as that's where he was bought to play (He was intended for Sarri, and play like to his qualities) not as an rm in a 3 back.

In the start he struggled with finding his position, he's used to being hugged up against the line and as far up as the eye can see. But, he's having to drop back and make new runs. But, he's gotten a lot better at it! 

He's young. He's very, very young. He doesn't have experience yet, and he'll need a few years. You can't put any player into a Juve team this bad and expect him to play like Chiesa. His decision making is highly affected, and people bombarding him with comments isn't gonna help with his confidence.

I feel like there's a bad mood at Juve, compared to other teams. I know it's bad, but I was happy when I heard about Mckennie's party, as it means that they're finally getting along and having a good time. The Juve media channels used to post vids of Pogba and Allegri playing basket, now we get dark comments from Bonucci about how we need to improve and how we're still fighting. --&gt; and I think that has a big effect on a young energetic player.

"I'm Swedish so I was super excited by his transfer, but unfortunately he's been misused.

Doesn’t even include the bull (doesn’t it have to do with Turin, I’m not Italian not sure lol)   I mean the J logo was introduced in Milan which is pathetic, while I get it’s the fashion capital it also is host to our biggest rivals like Lmao.

"I know this isn't FM. But if we make it to UCL, i hope we get a major overhaul.

Unreliable and inconsistent players like Ramsey , Dybala , rabbit , Berna, etc is a must-sell. 

And need to buy de paul ( a player who can dribble and penetrate from centre and the most creative player in Serie consistently) and Locatelli ( the tank we miss, could be our Casimiro) .  Sassuolo is interested in fagioli and frabotta for locatelli . 
And we should get a decent LB to provide competition to Sandro . 

Morata can go back, depay is available for free and his wage demand is around 5m. He's a versatile and tactically brilliant player with great playmaking abilities .

And no more Pirlo , experience is a big thing. You have to build the foundation first . Pirlo clearly Dont know how to use the squad. 


And if...
If we don't make it to cl then.
We'll be missing 90 more millions, players above + Ronaldo and a few other players will be sold . Maybe delight too, pretty sure he won't stay to play uel when he has demand from ucl teams.

Usually, I try to at least be positive about what's gonna happen but we're fucked, our one hope was turning up in big matches and today we weren't just as shit as ever but players like Chiesa (just come back from injury so maybe not fair to judge him) and Cuadrado who are usually at a much higher standard to the rest were just as shit. I wanna hope for the result of the Milan, Atalanta match at the end of the season clinching us top 4 on something like goal difference (ngl didn't know this was one of only 2 leagues to use the backwards h2h &gt; goal difference system so yeah we're just done), but that would more than likely require us to beat Inter and Sass which I just can't see happening.

Pirlo needs to go at the end of the season, it's too late to be twatting about with a new coach but the fact that he's played a different combination or orientation of players in every single match shows he has absolutely no clue what he's doing. We need to go in for anyone with a shred of experience for next season, I'd even have taken Mourinho despite his flopping at Spurs. Don't get me wrong this will by no means solve **all** our problems but if Agnelli and Paratici aren't gonna step away this is quite honestly the best we can do for now.

Also what's with the weird 4-4-2 but really a sort of weird 4-3-1-2 with the 1 being a winger. I'm sick of seeing this formation with a CM as a winger cause they're not really playing the wing, they're playing as a wide CM and cutting in, nearly everytime I saw McKennie today he was central and it clearly isn't working. We're filling up a winger slot with a CM when we have a perfectly good winger struggling to play as a RB (RWB maybe but never RB), **WHILST** having a perfectly good RB on the bench twiddling his thumbs.",gxjbmzt,n8mzx8,Juve,2021-05-10 04:52:49,Wolf_Todd,9
"Well...where does one even start with this disaster. I'm in that numb stage of grieving where I'm not even angry, I'm just...numb. Unfortunately I feel like I've seen this coming for many weeks now and alas it has happened.

The planning for this season has been a complete joke- from hiring a manager with zero managerial experience, to a substandard transfer window to the shite kit design to the terrible CL performance and whole Super League debacle. There are no words. It has been a truly dreadful season. A terrible way to end our nine years of domestic dominance. We didn't even go down fighting, we went down like pussies.

It's no exaggeration to say that the club needs wholesale changes, top to bottom. New manager, new players, many players to go. New directors. New chairman. New Juve. Whether Elkann has the balls to do this is another matter.

I blame the entire situation on Agnelli, Paratici and Nedved. In that order. You can't blame Pirlo for this shit. He's been awful as a coach, but what did we expect? He wrote a nice thesis, and was a legendary player, but this was too big a job for him. And if you were in his shoes, you would always have taken the job.

The problems for Juve began with: a) Ronaldo's arrival, and b) Allegri's departure.

Amongst many others, I was a fierce critic of Allegri's 'boring' style of football but he won the league over and over again and was a master tactician. He was dedicated to the club and I miss him. If something isn't broken, don't bloody fix it. There we were, in 2018 arguing on this sub about why we keep failing in CL finals. Now we're arguing about why we're not making top four, and why our team looks like a giant shitfest of zero fucks.

The elephant in the room is the financial situation. We really need to be careful now, because if we don't get CL (which we VERY likely will not now) our books could be seriously in the red.",gxjbtd1,n8mzx8,Juve,2021-05-10 04:54:14,Lord_Maul,26

"Anybody who says that Pirlo is in any position to lead this team (or any new reformed Juventus team) in then next 5 years toward any sort of important silverware is delusional.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I have zero clue what this team does between games? Do they train? Do they do drills? Do they analyze the competition? Make conscious choices on who to field? Even comes down to substations... we play like garbage all game and we only make subs at 65+++? It’s obvious he is in way over his head and a team of Juve’s caliber should’nt be experimenting with amateurs. 

Send him to Primevera or make him an assistant coach to someone who actually has a clue. (Lampard &amp;lt;&gt; Tuchel is the perfect mirror example)

"As sad as this was, I can't help but laugh. What a garbage team Pirlo has managed to put out at the end of a season. 

This squad has its issues yeah, we all agree, but you cannot tell me this squad isn't good enough for top 4. That is Pirlo's fault. 

He has failed miserably to get anything out of this team. Everyone looks flat, slow, demotivated, toothless, and lazy. What have these guys been doing all season in training?! What the actual fuck has he been trying to instill? 

I haven't said it yet this season, and my belief is a manager should be given time, but not qualifying a squad of this caliber for CL is a disgrace, and demands immediate firing. Get out. This is unacceptable.",gxjbe5o,n8mzx8,Juve,2021-05-10 04:50:53,i_Avernus,14

"The thing about Cristiano is that he scores a lot of goals, but he doesn't play as a striker.  Now, under normal circumstances, that is amazing, and to be fair, it is still amazing, especially since he's 35?  36?  But the frustrating thing is he doesn't play as a striker, which led to Juve's tactical difficulties, and I'm not talking about Juve's recent tactical difficulties, but rather the tactical difficulties that arose when he arrived at Juve in 2018.  

In my opinion, these difficulties arose from two primary reasons, how it is Ronaldo plays, and how it is Dybala plays.  If we look at Ronaldo's career, the one thing stands out is that he was never really the focal point of attack.  Before people jump in saying, 'he scored so many goals, how is he not the focal point of attack', if you watched his games with Real (which is where he switched from being an outright winger to a wide forward) you'll notice that the person who Ronaldo played off was Benzema - in that Ronaldo's movement off the ball had a lot to do with where Benzema was, and his movement.  In that sense, the focal point of Real's attack was Benzema (point of reference if that makes it easier), and Benzema's job, as the primary striker, was to bring in other players into the attack, create goal scoring opportunities and score goals.  Similar to Ronaldo, Dybala throughout his time at Juve was never really the focal point of attack, it was always a primary striker; first was Mandzukic, and after was Higuain.  

Further to my point, we can look at Ibrahimovic at Milan.  Milan's attack without Ibrahimovic is somewhat more haphazard and messy, but Ibrahimovic is able to play as that primary striker and serve as the focal point of Milan's attack, giving structure and form to how Milan's move the ball forward and around the penalty area.  

Moving back to Ronaldo and Dybala, the fact that Ronaldo and Dybala are unable to play as the primary striker means that Ronaldo and Dybala can't play together, because then Juventus wouldn't have a focal point in attack, something it dearly needs.  As result, this season Juventus brought in Morata, to serve as that focal point, and that player who can hold up the ball and bring in other players into the game.  Now, the interesting thing is that Ronaldo and Dybala, in my opinion at least, both possess the ability to serve as that primary striker, and even function as a single striker - both possess the 'Complete Striker' skillsets, however, due to their tendencies, they are unable to properly play as that primary striker and serve as that focal point in attack.  

For Ronaldo, I'm more forgiving, because Ronaldo started as a winger, and so while he has move more central as he grew older, that winger's mindset is still ingrained in his brain, so he drifts out wide when you'd wish he'd stay more central.  Further to that, Ronaldo has never had to play as a single striker (he does at Portugal but that's a slightly different thing altogether) and so could hone his craft to simply goal scoring.  In a weird way, I think Ronaldo's desire to score goals (not a bad thing mind you) actually hinders him from playing as a lone striker.   For Dybala, I'm slightly less forgiving, because he's younger, and should have been able to adapt his game more.  

With regards to the 'problem', while one could say the problem is what I have mentioned above, it would be rather unfair to simply pin all of Juve's problems on Ronaldo.  Personally, I didn't want Ronaldo to join Juve in 2018 in part because of the problem above, but mostly because there were other much more pressing areas that needed rebuilding (not reinforcing but rebuilding).  Juve's run to the UCL final in 2016/2017 was remarkable, but largely covered up the cracks that were there, namely that the midfield was inadequate.  This inadequacy was highlighted to me in the finals against Real when, Real brought on Bale (or Asensio) and Juve brought on ... Lemina.  As a result in management not properly reinforcing the team in the midfield, we have the midfield problem we have today.  

Now, some people like to blame Ronaldo for the woes that Juve has saying, if he wasn't here Juve would have money enough to reinforce the midfield and fullback position etc., etc.  And while technically that may be true, does not really pinpoint the main problem, and that is the management instead of reinforcing/rebuilding the midfield decided to spend money on a forward that Juventus at that time didn't really need.  

In short, there are tactical difficulties, but Juve's woes should not be placed on Ronaldo's shoulders, that is the fault of the management.  Ronaldo is always going to be Ronaldo - he will score goals.  Yes, it would be nice if Ronaldo could play in how some of us feel would be generally more beneficial to the team, but considering the team as it is today, I don't really think it would make that much of a difference, maybe the 2014/2015 team.",gxc94zj,n6ulku,Juve,2021-05-08 09:07:49,jaumougaauco,8

"Our squad imbalance is basically what is killing us throughout these past years, and you see the same problem burning teams like PSG and Barca as well. 

In Real Madrid, Ronaldo had at least 3 or 4 clear chances to score every game from the production of the fullbacks and world class midfielders. While he has gotten that service on occasion at Juve, it definitely is not as consistent as it needs to be if we want to challenge for anything serious. 

In preseason, Pirlo mentioned wanting to play a high intensity press like Bayern, with the intention of immediately winning the ball and transitioning quickly into attack. Mckennie and Chiesa have been solid acquisitions by the board to meet that desire. However, looking back at the PSG vs Man City game for example, Neymar and Di Maria not tracking back cost PSG quite a bit. I'm not saying PSG would win if they both were pressing but it definitely hurt. When watching Chelsea vs Real Madrid, I saw how organized and disciplined Chelsea were in the defense, something we used to posses but do not any longer. Their press was very organized and every player was committed to running for the full 90 minutes. Obviously it helps that they have kante, mount, etc, but in just 2 years, Chelsea have transformed their squad from one that was solely reliant on Hazard to create anything to now a defensive powerhouse with multiple attacking threats. 

I think the big thing to think about this summer is mainly the direction we want to go with the squad and commit fully. I personally think bringing Pirlo in was a premature move, but I doubt we can go for anyone else under our financial situation. I would love to see us get better creative options in midfield and maybe a new lb, but I also wouldn't be surprised to see ronaldo, dybala, and more sold due to the financial situation. I just hope that we can rebuild fast enough before someone like De Ligt thinks about leaving our club.",gxan5ee,n6ulku,Juve,2021-05-08 01:17:14,Supersayann,2

Off the field, he is arguably the greatest marketing move football has ever seen. On the field, it has been anything but. Yes, 99 goals are great, in fact, incredible. But we are not Ronaldo FC. We lost both Higuin, Kean and Manzukic in the process, with Dybala not fully flourishing also a possible by-product. 

It’s undeniable that we have become worse with him on the team.  Not his fault, but that’s still a fact. Allegri was right, there’s a lot of investing needed. The money we pump into him takes away money from other parts of the team. 

This shitshow is not completely his fault. Some of it is, yes. 1 of 87 odd free kicks converted is laughable. But he shouldn’t be completely blamed for it completely. The higher ups failed as well, especially nedved and partici. They need to go.

Im fine with sticking with him because hes been steadily improving, hes a team player, he does whatever is asked of him, his work rate and effort are solid, hes been mostly reliable, but his days of playing 40-50 games a season are over. A good backup is the pragmatic and imo correct move for the club.

"I personally don’t see the point? 

The club made a decision to move away from that style and clearly want a more possession based style. Why not back pirlo properly in the transfer market. 
We’ve made a radical change in playing style, and half backed it in the window and with the players we have. 

We either totally ditch the project and revert back to the old Juve under conte and allegri ( which I imagine being goodbye cristiano) 
Or we stick with this new path and actually give managers and coaches a chance by backing them with actual players they need. 

We’ve become obsessed with getting that great “free agent” but while it was great with a few transfer, it’s dead now. We need to stop looking for the big superstars, and start getting players who can develop with us. That’s how we’ve always excelled. Mckennie, demiral those are the signings we need.

What was the point of appointing Pirlo if you're not going to give him a chance? It has been a poor season but it was to be expected.,gx6hbwm,n67e8m,Juve,2021-05-07 02:24:08,_smoothbrain_,2
"Of course he should return, from the club's point of view. 
Pirlo was a nice idea and had the potential to be a great one if Juve did have a good squad, but they expected an inexperienced coach to win while rebuilding - it doesn't work that way if you're not playing Football Manager, obviously.
Juve doesn't need Ole Gunnar Solskaer, to wait for him for years to become a winning coach, they need a winning coach right now, otherwise, they're risking losing hard-earned domination in Italy. Of course, they didn't win this year, but if they re-group and win the next one, they can continue the same path, but if they fail to win again, it could break them financially and lead to the failure of the whole project. Big investments and great players come with financial stability, and for Juve only way to do this is to be successful both in the national league and CL.
Allegri was the best coach Juve head from Lippi and his results were incredible. At the point he left the team definitely needed a change, as it was obvious both he and the team weren't able to motivate each other to reach 100% of potential. And he left as a winning coach, I'm pretty sure Juve would have disastrous the previous season if he stayed.
Sarri and Pirlo were both interesting options, but budget ones, unfortunately, same as the team's midfielders - unable to help great defense and attack to reach its full potential.
Now, after the break, both Juve and Allegri could use a fresh start, and what's the better choice than the coach who already proved himself to be the winning one? He knows the structure of the team, most of the players already respect him and no one else could probably adapt as a coach as fast as he can.
An additional argument for this is that Juve probably won't have big money to spend this summer, rather will have to sell and buy or invest in young, reasonably priced players, and you need an experienced coach to deal with it.
So yeah, the conclusion is, if Allegri is ready for the return, the club should beg him on the knees to take over this team again.",gx8z9y1,n67e8m,Juve,2021-05-07 15:33:52,cartoon200,2

I feel bad for him, we didn't let him do his work. I think he could make the team play his Sarriball if CR7 is not there..   
Moreover, he still won the title with a covid season (so so SO close), lost to Lyon in UCL yes but City lost too, because Lyon was fresh, they didn't finish their League.

"&gt;Considering the widely reported story that he told the team to sell Ronaldo on his way out of the door two years ago, this would imply that he would want Ronaldo sold, or at least downgraded in importance to take the job.

"I'm 50/50 on keeping Pirlo and returning to Allegri. I think as long as the team is supported through the transfer market, both will be good options. 

Because of his expectations when coming in and his demeanor, I don't think Pirlo has lost respect in the locker room like Sarri did at the end of last season. There will be a lot of frustrated players, but for a very weird COVID season, Pirlo did a fair job. He had a vision and set the team up to make it happen, but he did really poorly to adjust later in the season when we accrued injuries and needed to tactical adjust.

Allegri was let go because the team wanted to play a faster, more aggressive, 'UCL style' of football. Sarri and Pirlo have brought us closer to that (however slightly). Bringing Allegri back would probably give the team stability after a rough 2 years, but it could also hinder our goal to address that slower type of footballing he is fancy to.

I'm personally over the coach roulette at this point, seeing what it has done to some EPL clubs and ours, I'd probably just want to stick with Pirlo for at least another half of a season to see if he can carry on with a positive outlook.",gx6brh3,n67e8m,Juve,2021-05-07 01:46:22,JimmyCertified,0

Zidane is best when he has a team of high level stars at his disposal to take them to the next level as a team. He can't work with limited resources.

"Scudetto is the only thing they can be proud of. Juve kicked its ass out of Coppa Italia and if we're lucky, we'll clash against them for Supercoppa Italiana. That's if we don't lose against Atalanta in the final.  

Putting aside that, I just hope for two things:

1) Juve waking up after not winning the scudetto. Not only at Serie A, but UCL too.

2) Inter (&amp; any other italian team) showing some decent level at next UCL. I'm getting tired to see them choking against any team who's not from the local league.",gwsxrjt,n40y8e,Juve,2021-05-04 01:05:18,ablessedbandito,27
"We can definitely rip em apart for that but it does seem like Conte has turned that team into contenders. He was never great at managing multiple competitions. He's a king domestically and also fantastic when focus is on one competition (Euro 2016) but he's not great there.

The problem is we have historically been 2nd place UCL competitors. I think we're 2-7 in the final?

Inter will most likely continue to win domestically for as long as Conte and Inter are happy, which let's face it won't be for very long. They will eventually have a falling out (2 years?) and he will leave but we don't know when that will be exactly. In that time I expect him to continue competing/winning for 1st but also falling out of the UCL which Conte is pretty crappy at coaching in. 

If we want to beat Inter during Contes time I think we have to win the UCL. I don't want us to devote all of our energy to winning the scudetto and sucking in the UCL. That will really only be the only way that we can have our bragging rights since he's a legend domestically. 

Allegri is one of our best options but there are also others. Zidane would be a dream for UCL. I do think we lost our shot when we didn't buy Marcelo and Zidane that one year which would have almost assuredly gave us a UCL. There are others as well that we could hire but it seems like we will take Allegri. 

I'm excited for the future and excited to face an Inter side that can actually compete. We also know they will suck in the UCL so we can rip em for that when they get knocked early group/RO16. We just need to do better lol.

- He leaves at the end of the season and we say thank you for wearing a Juve shirt, he honored every minute it.

Everyone sees it as Juve has been underperforming since Ronaldo joined, Ronaldo keeps juve players from developing and that they've been to 2 UCL finals before Ronaldo.
But what they don't want to see is the Board's incompetence. 
They lost incredible players like Pogba, Vidal and Marchisio and didn't replace them. They exchanged Cancelo, one of their best creative players for a bum like Danilo(who has been good this season tho) and Dybala never hit the form he had back in 2016 or 17. Neither did Morata.

I have nothing against sacking Allegri, but you sacked a manager that was adaptable, to hire a system coach. A coach that needed specific players to play a specific way. 

Sacked him, cool, then you hire a coach with 0, literally NO experience. A man who wasnt even officially a coach before he signed the contract. 

Shitshow. Management should be embarrassed by the last 3 seasons. What it this?! Yea we need to rebuild, BUT THIS AIN'T IT CHIEF!

Edit: I didn't even get to our midfield situation, or the fact that our winger has been carrying our team as a RB. There's so much fundamentally wrong with this team, then hiring Pirlo is just the cherry ontop of the garbage heap.",gwkjpzt,n2o29y,Juve,2021-05-02 02:34:44,i_Avernus,67

"This has been coming for a long time. We deserve to loose it. We haven’t been good enough. In hindsight, should we have fired Sarri? No. Should we have promoted Pirlo? No. But people make mistakes. We move on.

The team needs drive. It needs motivation. Grinta. At the end of the day, our players are still some of the best in the world, but they just don’t have the motivation to show it. It’s a team filled with leaders, yet with no real leadership. Something has to change cultural wise. It’s not working. 

Do we fire Pirlo? No. Do we remove Pirlo from the first team? Yes. Another mistake that we made was to promote Pirlo before he had even submitted his thesis. I think he should be reinstated as the u23s coach if they fail to make Serie B, or the primivira coach if the results aren’t good enough. He knows he hasn’t been good enough. 

Fire partici. He’s made some absolutely shocking calls. You can get away with one or two mistakes, but giving away 12 mil a year gross to a guy who hasn’t touched the ball all season is just unacceptable. 

Replace them both with Allegri. Give the man what he wants. Let him build his own team. He’s our best option right now. Who cares if it’s a boring 2-0 win every game. At least we’re winning. 

And finally, and this is probably gonna get me murdered, but here me out, sell ronaldo. He’s been great. He’s given so much to the club. But it’s undeniable that since he joined the team has gotten worse. Not just because the team has lost a massive part of the budget to give to other parts of the squad, but the players have lost motivation. Grinta. They just expect for him to win every game. Or maybe not. But his presence at juve right now is not a positive thing. He has to go.",gwlm6ey,n2o29y,Juve,2021-05-02 07:21:23,_ForzaJuve_,8

Im not a Juve fan but i grew very fond of you guys watching you struggle in CL. And if im being honest you were just unlucky.. there was nothing wrong with players Allegri managed.. nor was nothing wrong with him.


I looked up some previous matches and analysis of tactics.. how he outperformed Zidane, Pochettino etc

In one match he subbed off De Sciglio or Alex sandro im not so sure IN THE FIRST HALF.. IN THE 15th MINUTE. Reason? He didn't mark Isco properly so he put Lichsteiner on the pitch.


I mean.. I know that that was urgent since you were fighting for a comeback in Santiago Bernabeu but still. That move proved to me that Allegri is not a joke manager. That move was big balls energy.

"1. Results: Win Serie A and Coppa Italia. Reach at least the UCL QF. 2. Tactics: move away from the erratic pressing, turgid possession football that was seen under Pirlo and Sarri. Towards, a low-intensity, defensively organized football. Start games at high intensity,  score and then sit back. Chiesa and Kulusevski are well suited to this kind of football. Sarri and Pirlo were too stubborn to understand playing a high-line with slow CBs, and playing possession football without advanced playmakers and a proper regista in midfield is pointless. If high pressing is not done in a synced way it’ll open up spaces for opponents to exploit. 3. Rotations: rotate smartly in order to keep all the players in good shape until the end of the season and minimize injuries. In addition, this fosters competition between players. In his last season at Juve, Allegri barely rotated, and killed competition by rewarding mediocre performances with starts over and over again. 4. Develop Dragusin. Sometimes we’ll need to play a high line. Bonucci is not suitable to play in a high line defense. Danilo, Alex Sandro, de Ligt are be better suited to this kind of defending. I haven’t seen Dragusin play, but I doubt he’s slower than Bonucci and Chiellini. Developing Dragusin is much cheaper than spending more into another CB (don’t remind me about Romero...

Tactically, I would be very disappointed if we just get the old Allegri again.

He sounded like he had learned and adapted, so I would expect that to be reflected in this tactics. I’m not saying he’s gonna be Jurgen Klopp but I would still expect him to want a more intense, quick playing style than we got used to in his last two seasons.

"I think you guys are all too optimistic, or people think that this years lackluster results are all Pirlos fault.

We have issues on goalkeeper position, while its not so huge we are already late with proper replacements, due to other issues and budget we can't really get what we need.

Defense, this is MAJOR issue, we gave both spinazzola and romero for nothing. Now we have problems, de ligt is still young and prone to errors, chielini is always injured, cuadrado and sandro need replacements because there is no fucking way thay they can play so many games, both of them are plagued with injuries and we have no decent replacement.

Midfield is somewhat problematic, but its least of our problems, artur can do a lot if he gets motivated, mckenni is also good, but we couls use 2 more (maybe locatelli will come)

I think Kulusevski and Chiesa will be huge next year, chiesa especially, he is a beast.
Dybala plays inconsistent and is injured, i hope he will have better season, but id rather we sell him.
CR should also go, in longterm its better for us.

Im not even gonna mention striker since we dont have proper striker, Morata is sometimes there, sometimes not.

To think we can do a lot with this kind of issue is ridiculous ,  with or without Max, we got a lot of old, and expensive players, we got no budget, or major youth prospects.

2 - most Juve fans are complete stooges... make no mistake, yesterday was a MAJOR mistake by de Ligt.... and as usual, Juve fans let him off the hook by saying it was unlucky and ""hopefully he learned from it""..... de Ligt has made A LOT of mistakes at Juve (which is fine &amp; expected) and fans always overlook it or make excuses/place blame elsewhere.... but when someone like Bonucci does anything wrong, the fan base shits all over him about how terrible he is and needs to be replaced.... 

imagine if Bonucci did for Italy what de Ligt did yesterday and Italy got knocked out... I imagine the reaction would be juuuussssttttt a little bit different 

so many Juve fans evaluate players based on who they like.... and that is why so many Juve fans are hypocritical frauds and stooges

Unpopular opinion but I felt there were times where Veratti slowed down the attacks. He hogged the ball and tried too many dribbles. The first two games the Italians felt a little faster in moving the ball up the field. With Veratti it felt like a more classic Italian approach where a regista type player holds the ball and picks his passes at his own pace. I think he'd be a better player to come on in the second half if Italy are winning and they want to slow down the game and keep control of possession,h2jipot,o4mgyj,Juve,2021-06-21 22:48:43,boudzab,5

What i have understand, the project is that we go bac to buying Italian talent. Thats what Juventus was known from. Buying good Italian players. Milan and Inter was the teams that went buying foreign talent. I think begining of 2010 Italy really didnt have so much talented young players. Oh and before Zaniolo was hurted, there was the napkin in the restaraunt where Pratici wrote his name and other talents he wanted to buy. Then he got injured and covid happened.

Edit: if i remember correct Berardi price was too high for us to buy and he has played at same level for 2-3 years now and seems to peaked and he isnt any better than Chiesa and he is older.",h20gqgg,o1exp9,Juve,2021-06-17 04:49:31,Shambuktu,8

Gabriel Jesus has almost a decade of experience at the top level. Pogba is WC (and was at Juve).

Barella never made it past the CL's group stage.

Locatelli is having a breakout year - fine - like many others before him, and we might even sign him.

Berardi (turning 27 this year) we tried signing him multiple times, he just wants to stay at Sassuolo. Top of his career was the EL's group stage.

Spinazzola (28 yo) was a Juventus' player. Had to let him go to fix the budget. I agree it's a pity, but he was injury prone (and probably still is).

I am not sure who you are referring to.

Kean? Hardly a star.

Coman? I wouldn't call him a star. Back at that time, selling him was definitely the right choice. Besides, I am not sure how much input Paratici had considering Marotta was still there.

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought Paratici was a bad DG or DoF whatever those acronyms mean. Like many others, he has his own obsessions about certain players, but he is hardly a noob.

Of course, my national team goes first and if we play Italy in a world cup there is no way I'm supporting them above my country (although I wouldn't be mad at them and support them to finish the job properly), but in the few years my team wasn't qualifying to international tournaments, Italy was there for me to support, so yeah I'm pretty attached to them because I love football because of them, I even know their national anthem lol.

In 2014, if they had made it through the group stage we would've played Italy in the WC, and I was terrified of that happening, Italy is like my country football-wise",h1gp4pp,nxrvpj,Juve,2021-06-12 08:01:17,[deleted],6
I’m from Puerto Rico and grew up following the Italian National team since I was a kid. In fact I became a fan of Juventus because I loved Buffon and Del Piero.

I ended up marrying a woman who is Italian. I’ve been learning Italian to get my citizenship by marriage in the future too. 

I’m 100% a USMNT fan first, but in the Euros I’m all behind the Italian National team. If the US is knocked out from the World Cup, my support is behind Italy for sure.",h1h0z4u,nxrvpj,Juve,2021-06-12 09:53:50,Juventus19,4

I grew up in a poorish working class background.

In 1992 Sky launched the PremierLeague.

We had no sattelite tv. Only free to air.

I grew up watching Italian football on channel4.
JamesRichardson. Gazzetta. Sundays were spent watching live broadcasts from LaStilo.

I opened my heart then and there to everything Italian.

I grew up trying to emulate everything Italian.

I drink Italian coffee. Wine?... A bottle of Montepulciano or Barolo please. Sunglasses??...I sport Vanni.

My body is English but my heart and soul is Italian.

I ended up with the Sony/Kappa home shirt and an obsession with Juve and Italian football in general. The black and white helped too! I spent my Sundays watching Football Italia on the tv, had posters of del Piero, Ravanelli (I was ecstatic when he came to Derby, less so when he left), Peruzzi, Montero etc. I sat in my Juve shirt last night (not the same one I got when I was 11… I’m 39 now!) and cheered on gli Azzuri.",h1huu4m,nxrvpj,Juve,2021-06-12 15:55:04,reeko1982,3

Anyways I was happy hearing that because I've been a juve fan since the early 2000s because of video games haha. I loved using juve in one the old N64 games. So occasionally they would show big games on tv and I was able to catch some real european soccer and I watched Del Piero &amp; many more and just fell in love with the style. Also helped that buffon has literally been on juve forever and marchisio too. Anyways now I support the italian national team because lots of juve players and I watch lots of serie a. I do still support the united states and would probably support them over italy but in every other case it would be US, Italy, France in that order.

We follow GJustJuve on YouTube and watch every single one of their games and Italy religiously.

If Gigio joined and in 3 years demanded a transfer that’s fine who cares we’d get a nice transfer fee for one of the top goalies in the world in their prime.

That being said, I personally just think raiola messed up the whole negotiation with Milan. I think Milan called Raiolas bluff and signed Maignan and Gigio and Raiola wernt expecting it. Which is why they’re desperate right now and are going to go to PSG despite navas being there. If gigio really wanted to leave they would have had a team lined up for him already.

I’m not. Juve could not sign him because  Szczęsny is massively overpaid. It’s not like clubs were lining up to buy the Polish GK.

We are so bad at selling players, its a joke at this point. Management change clearly hasn't helped in that regard.  The fact there is 0 interest in tek is just brutal...he is not a top tier keeper that commands massive wages, yet we still couldn't find a solution.

As Marotta used to like to say, you look for opportunities in market, and this was one. We couldn't take advantage of it because yet again we can't move players on.

Add to this that we are sitting around doing nothing before the Euros is just silly. We need to raise like 100mio before the end of june - how are we going to do that when the tournament has already started.

"He’s one of the few sellable assets that we can report a capital gain on. Selling Demiral makes sense from a financial perspective. But also from a sporting one. Demiral is not good enough to play for a top club, and the jury is still out on whether he ever will be. He’s certainly good enough to play as a squad player at Juve, but the player probably wants to play consistently so he can develop. If the rumors are true about Dortmund’s interest and they could guarantee more playing time for Demiral, then why wouldn’t the player want the move? We can get an affordable squad player to replace him in the meantime and then invest in another strong center back when we are in the position to do so since time is working against Bonucci and Chiellini",h6h93fs,orbssb,Juve,2021-07-25 22:53:36,LiuKunThePooh,33

Merih’s contract expires in 2024, so if he remains unhappy through this season, his sale price will become lower and lower.

"1. Chiello - Obvious choice.     
2. Barzagli - Also obvious, 9 years, 9 Serie A titles.        
3. Bonucci - If not for the Milan thing it would be obvious as well, he has over 300 games at Juve and 8 Serie A titles.      
4. Marchisio - Il Principino for a reason, was always underrated.     
5. Pirlo - Helped return Juve to the top of Italy.     
6. Lichtsteiner - The Swiss Express, over 200 matches at Juve, 8 titles.     

I feel like Mandzukic deserves an honorable mention but he's not there, he personified Juve grinta but he wasn't here long enough (we are the club he played for the longest though).

(Half) Joking aside, Chiellini for sure. He stayed with us after Calciopoli, and has been with us faithfully after all these years. That alone earned him a place in the temple of the gods along side with the likes of Buffon, Del Piero, and Pavel Nedved. He also has the 4th most appearances, trailing only Del Piero, Buffon, and Scirea, and if he were to play another season with us, he will most likely to end up 3rd place. He’s the closest to a living and still playing Juventus icon that we have.

Cuadrado might be a bit of an outside choice but he has had a major impact at the club and a lot of it goes unnoticed.

The one goal they did concede was a free kick - nothing from open play, and that is credit to world class defenders and two strong defensive midfielders. Kyle Walker in particular can shut down Insigne and Chiesa.

If they get some passes in midfield, you do not want Kane getting a hit on goal, and he creates so much pressure it opens up room for Sterling and Saka/Foden/Sancho. In particular, from experience over the years watching Juve play, I think Chiellini will have a difficult time against the likes of the fast skillful players England have on the wings.

Very excited to see these teams go head to head. Forza England!",h4l02rj,og6x77,Juve,2021-07-09 20:14:43,Sigalov,2

"Juve fan. I’m half English half Italian, I love both countries but being born and raised in the UK I’m supporting England. Hear me out. 

In terms of the final, I think Italy are slight favourites because I think they’ve beaten slightly better teams and fitting into the underdog mentality at Wembley will really suit them. Plus, I can see Verratti, Barella and Jorginho dominating the midfield battle.

But don’t underestimate England- we are in the final on merit. Before every single game, we were apparently going to ‘crumble’ against a ‘proper’ team such as Germany, Denmark etc but that hasn’t happened. We passed those tests. And this is coming from a country which, since 1966, has *never passed those tests*. Italy have (deservedly) reached way more finals than England, 4 WCs and have a much greater football history. But for England to defy history and deal with the pressure, from an objective point of view, is to be congratulated. 

Denmark were threatening for about 30 minutes in the first half, with a free kick and Dolberg having some shots, but after that England absolutely dominated and ran rings around them. England’s starting 11, especially upfront, is very strong. Italy’s starting 11 is better than England’s (apart from Kane, who is better than Immobile by a mile), but England has a much stronger bench and this tournament has shown that the bench matters. We can bring Foden, Grealish, Rashford, Sancho off the bench. All world class players with technique and pace. Italy just doesn’t have that supplementary firepower.

It will be a close game. I’m predicting 2-2, extra time and then England to score a winner. But being half Italian I know all about the Italian mentality, and they can definitely win.",h4hgq2d,og6x77,Juve,2021-07-08 23:46:26,Lord_Maul,3

"Just wanna open up a little. I have waited so long for this match. Italy vs fifa ranking #1. This day i was so hyped up to watch the game. 

Me and my friends was planning to go watch the game outside from the big screen but the place was packed and we was late so that was ruined. I wanted to go home watch the game but my friends was no lets go to this one guys house. I didt want to go because i knew there i couldnt be myself and be living in the game. I wanted go to home and be in the zone. But they made me go with them. We go to this guy house there are other people that i dont know.

First thing we wait outside first 15min of the game because they left to the store when we arrived and i have to watch the game from the phone… then they come and i watch the game. When i watch Juventus or Italy, i go inside the game. I talk with myself, i dont hear anything around me. I love football i watch a lot of games but when its Italy or Juventus i am so deep in the game its like i am on the sideline. It probably looks crazy that i just sit there and mumble sometimes and my hands making diffrent gang signs. So first half ends 2-1 i am happy. Its Belgium and i am still thinking anything could happen. These people are like hey calm down its just a game and talk like i am upset or something. I am like what have i done. I know i am not at home so ofcourse i dont scream or jump around and curse like normally i do when i watch the game at home. So these people are go take a walk relax calm down blaa blaa drink water blaa blaa… made me look crazy… i am like wtf? When your favourite teams play you put 50 diffrent stories to ig to show how ”great” supporters you are. I dont do that, when my teams play i am fully in to the game. They made looks so stupid and ruined my game. I was so sad second half and didnt even give a damn. Waited so many days for this game. After many years watching Italy playing great football against a good team was ruined for me. I love when Juventus and Italy celebrate defending and it makes me so happy when Chiellini and the guys hug each other and start slapping each other. I love seeing that. Today was first time when they celebrate all that i was just sitting and waiting to the game end and couldnt even care what happens… i cant help myself when i watch these teams i am not there anymore, i am in the game. Being sad for people taking away my joy of football and making fun of that. Then seeing Spinazola crying i almost started to cry also. 

Learn from mistakes and never watch Italy or Juventus with people that dont really love football. So many good memories with other friends that love football like me even tho they arent Juventus or Italy fans but not making fun of me when i celebrate and i am super excited about a goalline save etc… only good thing is it was in the first half when they made all goals.",h3v5pp7,ocjbud,Juve,2021-07-03 07:28:51,Shambuktu,12

"Our current roaster can compete for the scudetto, it could have last season and it will be even more competitive next season because we have Allegri and because Inter and the other contenders are getting weaker. That being said, I think what Cherubini said was also to let others (Sassuolo?) understand that we won’t start bids for players we like (Locatelli) because we are already ok, we know Locatelli wants us so we have good chances to get a good deal. Beside that we can’t expect any big deal this summer given the current financial situation, and we are very lucky compares to others, look at Inter or Napoli.

The goals are there, Ronaldo, Morata, Chiesa, Dybala, etc. But the service/assists still isn’t there, our forwards like Morata and Chiesa this season assisted/contributed a lot and Cudrado from wing back too as our top provider, but not a single center midfielder managed to assist over 10 goals this season and since Pjanic I think. Just look at Bayern, Lewandowski has got service and passes from all sides from midfield and up with Kimmich being the deepest.

"I want to see some world-class scouting. When did Juve last secure a bargain deal? Cristian Romero for €26 M? Juve must invest in young players at sensible prices (payment magnitude), let them compete for starting and give them rotation minutes. They earn a little compared to less skilled, experienced footballers. 

Most of Juve’s transfers since 2016 have been terrible. Higuaín cost around €175 million in cash over 5 years and had a great, then good season. After that he was finished. Pjaca was not given enough chances by Allegri, and then injuries ruined him. Bernardeschi has been a terrible flop. €40 M and €4 M in wages for a winger that has 9 goals and 13 assists in 4 seasons at the club. De Sciglio, a slow, weak, back-passing FB. Douglas Costa, a one season wonder, bought on his peak. Wingers usually decline after 28. The Bonucci, Lemina and Zaza sales were amazing, as was Caldara’s sale. In 2019/20, Juve invested €129 M on CBs (not taking wage expenditure and amortization into account), neglecting the CM and wingers departments, which were crying for investment. That season, Juve sold relatively well, though the Cancelo and Spinazzola fees were inflated due to “swaps”. In 2020, Juve addressed the need for quality wingers, bringing in Chiesa and Kulusevski. Who are already better than the Bernadeschi, Douglas Costa signings back in 2017. The Arthur for Pjanic swap was an amazing deal. Juve slightly improved their midfield by adding McKennie, addressing the beed for a box-to-box midfielder. 

Right now, Juve’s priorities should be: 1. Bringing in an advanced playmaker in midfield. 2. A young, attacking LB to compete with Alex Sandro. 2. Offloading the deadweight: Bernardeschi, de Sciglio, and Ramsey. 3. A CF. 4. Selling Dybala if he refuses to renew at more than his current wages. If he refuses to leave, send him to Juventus Under 23, and replace him with da Graca.",h3ug6r1,ocaywc,Juve,2021-07-03 04:04:57,magicajuveale,2

"Was a pretty sobering press conference. They basically said that they are happy with the current team and think its competitive. Its clear we have no money to make investments. Im completely fine with that, but it irritates me they can't just be honest about it. No one believes this team is good enough to win the league, and Allegri isn't going to magically fix that. They could just be honest and say the pandemic has been rough on us, and we need to make due with what we have. As if its some sort of issue with their pride. Even papa Flo has no problems saying they don't have the money. Why try to spin BS? They will get much more understanding from the fan base then with these false brovado statements. We were shit last year, have a massive gap in quality int he midfield, and tbh have played ugly ass football for 2-3 years now. Just own it and say we are moving forward with a different strategy. 

Resetting the expectations with such a statement would also allow us to try spend the next couple of windows finding homes for our deadweight, and instead focus on promoting some youth players or rehabilitating and integrating younger players that have been on loan and couldnt work their way into the team. That way, even if they don't work out we will be able to sell them since they now have Serie A experience, and may still be at a level suitable to smaller teams. 

They kind of screw themselves, because based on their statement I think we are rightfully able to expect that we challenge for every trophy, since competitive for us this past 10 years means that. Pretty silly...",h3qa3s0,obqq7l,Juve,2021-07-02 05:18:40,ADP10,4

"Juventus business as always been prudent. Locatelli does not want Arsenal and our relationship with Sassuolo is good. Let the media talk. We will sign him. His name was mentioned last summer and this sub wasn’t sure, now all the sudden he is a hot ticket. It’s a smart move on our part to not immediately shell out the cash. Negotiations need to take place. As talented as he is, he is not the end all to our project. Let’s see how our new management gets things done.",h3mcxxs,ob7kol,Juve,2021-07-01 07:35:21,[deleted],10

"sounds like normal negotiation stuff.... 

Sassuolo telling the media that Arsenal made an official offer &amp; are pushing hard to sign him doesnt really matter if Locatelli doesnt wanna go there (which I cant imagine he does) 

Sassuolo wants the money up front.... Juve wants to spread it out.... I still feel pretty good they'll reach a compromise.... especially once Italy wins/is eliminated from the Euros",h3mbpxs,ob7kol,Juve,2021-07-01 07:24:57,CaptainRock22,5
"Relax, people. Its completely normal he comes out saying this. He’s using the media to exercise pressure on Juve. He wants us to not only raise our offer, but also to do it as quickly as possible. Carnevali knows what’s up. If Locatelli wants to leave, he knows he needs that deal closed as soon as the transfer window opens so he can properly invest it. Remember Sassuolo just hired Dionisi and he most likely wants to look into the market for a replacement for Locatelli, and maybe a couple other signings that can help him implement his tactics, boost the team, and prepare for next season. Carnevali knows the team has a good thing going and wouldn’t want to lose that momentum.

With all that being said… Arrivabene and Cherubini better not fuck this up. If that happens, I think I speak on behalf of all tifosi bianconeri when I say they’ll be starting their new tenure with the wrong foot in our eyes.",h3p3fi6,ob7kol,Juve,2021-07-02 00:12:49,Cuorebianconero,6

Honestly under these conditions locatelli can stay where he is. He is a good player but he is not worth more than 40 million. For sure it would be an upgrade compared to our midfield but he is not a champion who would solve our problems.

"If there’s one positive to take away, it’s that with Ronaldo gone the holes for this Juve team become more obvious and impossible to ignore. Makes rebuilding this team easier now. 

Rebuilding around Dybala might be a bad decision, but it certainly doesn’t compare to other terrible things with the team.

This midfield that’s out there is a joke. That goes without saying. Tek is average at best, Morata and the rest of the attack still needs work, and this team still needs to build an identity.

That being said you still have Chiesa, De Ligt, and a lot of good young pieces for the future. With Max back you gotta let this man cook and see what he comes up with. 

The might be a long road but Juve will get there.",hauo2sj,pe12hg,Juve,2021-08-30 05:22:33,JesusDaBeast,32

"It was a bad performance but I honestly didn't think it was as bad as most of the sub seems to think. Maybe because it's been a pretty rough 18 months for me and I'm a lot more chill about football as result, and I also watched Man City vs Arsenal earlier and had a high bar for what ""terrible"" looks like haha. 

The thing that I don't get the most is the people who said that most of the players ""didn't care"" except Chiesa because he was running around so much. To me it's clear that the players did care a lot, so much so that their frustration got the better of them in the second half. I also think that Chiesa probably ran around *too* much, and should learn to conserve some energy so he can be effective for the full 90 minutes. If you're just judging players' dedication from the amount they run then you'd have to say that Del Piero was one of Juve's least dedicated players.",haw1xv4,pe12hg,Juve,2021-08-30 12:09:09,lordleycester,5

"dybala is getting too much flak imo - he had it all to do, was played out of position / his natural role, and the only service he got were a few crosses that went 17 metres above his head. this match is entirely on allegri and the midfield who were somehow non-existent in defense and attack. locatelli needs to start and allegri needs to start experimenting fast, and by experimenting i don’t mean subbing de schifo for cuadra when we need 2 goals, i mean taking gambles on starting guys who are yet to prove how useless they are. if we field this side over the next 2 tough fixtures, it’ll be 1 point in 4 matches and we can almost kiss the scudetto goodbye",hauswnz,pe12hg,Juve,2021-08-30 05:58:20,forza18juventus,0

"This year is going to be rocky, but getting them to be a ""team"" is step one and the most important one as we won't solve all our problems the transfer window. They literally don't know how to play with each and stringing more than two purposeful passes was impossible this weekend. Off the ball work and field awareness were also bad.

Plus Allegri is going to play around and test things out. Everyone gave him shit about his lineup, but what better way to see which players and player combinations sink or swim then by throwing their feet the fire? Especially against Empoli and not a better side. It's the way I see it at least.

As much as I do like Dybala, rebuilding around any player is a bad decision 99% of the time. There are really only a handful of players over the last 20 years that you can build around. 

It's also why the traditional #10 is a dying breed in the modern game. We have players who are competent in everything midfielders who defend well and backs who attack like wingers.

I think what this team is lacking is consistency. Keep in mind we’ve had 3 coaching changes in the last what 5-6 seasons? All with differing coaching styles and strategies. Can’t blame the players when they are told to do one thing one season and something different the next. Once Allegri has a good feel for this team I think they will be ok.

"Midfield is still so bad, except for Loca, who did more than all other midfielders combined in the short time he was on the pitch. They can't control the pace of the game, don't cover the defence properly leaving huge spaces and can't carry the ball either, so Dybala and Chiesa had to constantly drop down to even get hold of the ball.

People reacted negatively about the Witsel rumors, but I seriously think he'd walk straight into our starting midfield and that it would be a huge improvement over what we have now.

"First 10 minutes or so looked nice, ball was being moved around quickly, had a nice flow to it.

Then it got ugly. Our midfield looked terrible. McKennie was out of place. Bentancur looked off. Rabiot is so frustrating to watch, he has the talent to play along side Pogba and Kante for France but looks like a quarter of the player at Juve besides his rare moments.

Dybala looked average. Chiesa was a beast again, our real only threat going forward. Just always hustling, true grinta.

In the past we have always started out slow under Max and I didn't expect this season to be any different. Our guys have spent the past three seasons doing everything they can to get the ball to Ronaldo and his sudden departure was obviously going to cause us trouble. We will get better.

We can score in transition, sometimes set up some set pieces, but we are unable to build calmly and penetrate the opposition box without some random piece of skill. This is something that any other big team is able to do, while juve just crosses randomly in the box and hopes opposition defenders fuck up.

I like that we're getting Kean, but Juve is severely laking link-up play up front, someone that can pass get it in the box regularly and play with Dybala constantly.

- we were actually playing pretty well before the goal
- can’t really blame a single person for the goal, just kinda unlucky it seemed to me
- plan fell apart after goal, only a few rare individual displays by Cuadrado, Chiesa and Dybala
- absolutely no idea what our plan of attack was after the break (crossing to Morata as if he is Peter Crouch???)
- Morata, Locatelli, Kulusevski ON: agreed, Bernardeschi and MDS ON: just no
- literally subbed off Chiesa for some reason, idk why he looked like our best player on the pitch to me, maybe something I missed?
- team just looked lost, didn’t have any idea how to score, resorted to wild (and still poor mind you) crosses into the box
- Refereeing: standard serie A stuff of the past few years smh

Definitely a poor game, sadly not how we wanted the team to react to Ronaldos transfer, definitely unfortunate to concede, but that’s football. Hopefully we have some time to prepare now and we’re ready for Napoli (gulp)

"I think that his last season with us was his worst one, which ironically was the season he became capocannoniere. I'm saying this because you could feel a major disconnect with him and the team, as if there was no chemistry or drive in him anymore (or it's likely that it was just Pirlo's tactics). At least in the 1st season I remember seeing a push in him in scoring goals but also trying to do something great with the team. 

The first half of the 2018–19 I think we played a pretty entertaining calcio, but the injuries ruined a story that could've been amazing. Later Sarri had no idea how to play without Dybala, and Pirlo even less idea on how to manage a winning team. Anyways, goodluck and godspeed to Cristiano, he tried because he's a professional but you could sense that something broke after the elimination against Lyon, and got tored apart after Porto.",haoch5e,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 20:40:45,R-leiva97,52

"I think all the discussions regarding CR7's impact at Juventus are missing a critical point.

When he was brought in for a record transfer fee, the management obviously hoped he would help Juve take the last step and win the UCL. But **it was first and foremost a marketing and financial move, much more than a technical/sports one**.

The amount of media coverage and PR that Juventus got because CR7 was playing for us was enormous - and that translates in increased sponsorships, in fans that buy tickets for exhibition matches and merchandise...

So yes, obviously CR7's purely technical/sports impact at Juve was bad. You can even call it a failure as the team's results clearly worsened compared to the earlier seasons.

But the marketing and financial move was an equally clear win.",haojzjc,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 21:48:30,polokojo,12

I think everyone knows he's not the same player. I don't share the same consensus that he took goals from other players. More like the rest of Juve fell off.

Plus I still can't believe he turned his back to the ball in that Porto free kick. I don't know why but I never look at him the same way after that",haokcb1,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 21:51:25,Shin_flope,18

"I really disagree with this. Obviously last season, for the majority of the games we won, you’d see him playing simply as a classic 9. But the 2 seasons prior and in losing scenarios last season he’d often drop deep and help the team get the ball forward. Last season you could feel he was getting tired of some of our current players though, as the link up plays just wouldn’t work. He failed to properly link up with Morata, Chiesa and just about any of our midfield.",har741z,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-29 09:59:48,S347735,4

"First of all I followed Ronaldo to Juve, but I’m staying here (not following him to epl), because this club is amazing!! 

I have seen Ronaldo in Real Madrid also and I can genuinely say that here in juve, he has played a lot more for the team, i was initially quite perplexed at multiple occasions when he will try to assist from positions where he would have a go in RM. If you have watched all the matches ( which I have) you will remember how many missed chances have Ronaldo created (via assists). We had a dream team when he came in, with Mandzukic and Allegri and others. We came close to winning UCL too, but then we went on chopping the winning team and created a Frankenstein with only Ronaldo kept back. Either they should have sold Ronaldo also with Allegri or have given the whole team another season. Right now he is leaving as a villain, which I feel is unfair. Because as we all know , we wanted him to leave for the team to sustain. Even if you don’t take goal stats, he always pushed the team ahead. But we kept pulling the rug from
under the feet.",harmybn,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-29 12:28:58,codevalley,3
"But if you look closely, Barring Chiesa &amp; Cuadrado... Was there anyone else who even put up a consistent performance over the season? I mean there was a confused looking Pirlo on the sidelines and Juve playing like their only tactics were if someone comes near you pass the ball backwards. TBH, Ronaldo was never a piece that could fit in the Juventus puzzleboard.

As for your thoughts about flopping at Manchester Utd, who knows?? maybe he may flop.. or maybe, just maybe... Pogba, Bruno F &amp; Sancho is all that he needs behind him for him to give the world a treat.",haor38x,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 22:43:36,Ejsberg,7
"I've been saying the exact same thing for two years. Very happy to see this here!

  It  will be interested to hear how the discourse around Ronaldo changes the coming year- assuming people actually watch him now that he is in England. Will people finally be ready to accept he has regressed a lot, or will they still believe he was amazing for Juve and only got worse after leaving. Maybe they will think premier league is too difficult for him.",haofahd,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 21:07:27,DOLOO,6

"I almost cannot believe I'm reading this. Especially coming from a fan of his. 

I won't say I'm alone in this because I remember there were people who were against Ronaldo right from the start, but it felt like half the sub was either blind or in denial when it came to judging his performances.

You described it perfectly, there was a lot of matches where he was invisible, lost posession numerous times, wasted free kicks and chances but would still get a goal or score a penalty and everybody forgot about his overall performance. This is the no. 1 reason I'm glad he's gone. He's just not THAT good anymore. Still an elite finisher but I think there's strikers out there that could be of much more use to Juve. Having the team work for Ronaldo really dragged us down at times and it was especially frustrating when he was totally marked out of games, which was most evident against Porto but there was other matches like that one too.

I salute you OP, you have a good head on your shoulders and you understand football.",hap2qjs,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-29 00:09:15,rndmlgnd,6
"Id say his clutch to useless moments ration is about 1:1. His goal record is great, but I think he took goals away from others as he had to be the focal point.

"I was a ronaldo hater when he scored that bicycle on us in the UCL final in 17. When he joined i was sure we were winning ucl, it was interesting seeing one of the greatest players on my favorite team. last season watching him, i felt he didnt give much for the team(like that game against porto, also small mannerisms on the pitch), he was our highest goalscorer and best striker no doubt. I can confidently say were better without him, maybe we wont sell as many kits but i think our brand will be even better without him milking the attention",haozalg,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 23:44:15,Gas4thelo,3
"I think he was one of our best players. However, people saying that he was the only one giving his all after certain games were undermining player like Chiesa or De Ligt. Him losing the ball unnecessarily or trying to get a foul called has led to counters that led to goals against. It’s not something that happened often, but it did occur a few times and some of our fans were quick on blaming our defense or our system or both, but not him. I think at the end he did more good than bad, but he wasn’t perfect and he had his share of off days. 

Regarding his stats, they are impressive and he has earned the praise he gets from them. However, I also want to point out that sometimes it felt that the team was playing to contribute with those stats. For instance, the 19-20 season, where he took all but two PK. Or goals like the one assisted by Dybala to help him reach the 30 goal mark of the season. Or when there are two players or more unmarked, and he isn’t the one receiving the pass he complains to his teammates. Yet despite his numbers, he had some games where he wasn’t his clinical self, hitting the post or out on 1 on 1 with the GK. Yes that happens to everyone, but if it’s a game where it’s happening to him, he shouldn’t be expecting the rest of the team to always be passing to him, for their objective is not help get the monkey of his back, but to win matches. 

Don’t get me wrong, he was awesome. Just sometimes his fans protected him from any constructive criticism. Constructive being a vital word here, because toxic criticism isn’t helping anyone either.",haoyfy9,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 23:37:57,pswdkf,2

"A shame you feel this way. I thoroughly enjoyed his time with Juve. While some argue that numbers don't tell the whole story, the fact is he put them up and got us some crucial wins. 

It's unfortunate that his time here will be judged harshly by some, because we couldn't make it deep into the CL. 

I think CR7 is still an elite finisher, but has obviously lost a step. Because of our lackluster midfield and constant manager rotation, all of the squad suffered as a result.

As a follower of CR7, I'm glad to see he turned down Man City and has decided to return to United. I'm hoping he can have a positive impact on the team and continue putting up numbers. As a fan a Juve, I very much look forward to this season, as I feel like this 'break up' will be beneficial for both CR and Juve. I think we'll see some more creative playmaking and I'm extremely excited to see how much further Chiesa and Locatelli develop this season. 

I will continue to cherish my autographed CR7 jersey (also signed by Arthur, Chiesa, Chiellini, Dybala &amp; Kulu :D).

Positive vibes all around from me. Fino Alla Fine!",hapog60,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-29 02:43:18,malman21,2
"I think last season you got both faces of the medal. In some matches he created goals out of thin air when our creativity was miserable. But in those same games he didn't pressure anyone nor tried to share the ball with the others. Cuadrado made a ton of assist because nothing except his dribble would ever come out from the left side, so we massively play on the right side.

Something broke after Porto, but he was also miserable in those 2 games. Our team is getting younger (De Ligt, Locatelli, McKennie, Benta, Chiesa, Kulu, Kean) and he wanted another thing at this stage of his career.

"Couldn't disagree more. Everyone has flaws and even Messi is not perfect either because barca fans always used to complain how Messi would not make any runs and his lack of pressing as well. Just like that ronaldo can give up possession easily and his lack of defensive input is zero. 

My man still scored and did his part with players like bentancur, Bernardeschi, Alex Sandro and Dybala now replace these players with pogba, Bruno, shaw, and rashford and you expect him to flop?!

It's really silly that people here have to be reminded over and over again that ronaldo can't carry the team  all alone, he has never done it with real madrid or manchester united. Offcourse he can turn matches around single handedly but it's nieve to expect him to bring you champions league on his own.

Ronaldo is a player who can improve the attack of any team on earth that's it! You can't expect him to control midfield and attack and dictate the tempo of the game. That's not how he works.

It is really silly to claim that ronaldo eats up the chances of other players when it was clearly not the case with real madrid as BBC scored collectively and its really not Ronaldo's fault that morata misses sitters or that dybala gets injured during the crutal part of the season and I certainly don't see ronny eating chiesa's chances as he scored 10+ goals last season.",haoz60j,pd8jmy,Juve,2021-08-28 23:43:17,Numaan68,6

You can't win champions league or Italian league with that game plan.   As we saw several years in a row.  It wasn't ALL his fault of course.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Man United have a better midfield than Juve, which means a lot of his current flaws will be covered and people will just say he is even better than previously at Juve.

The other point is reputation. Being back at United, his opponents will be more intimidated and more likely to make slightly more mistakes, causing him to play slightly better.

In the end, although people like you and I know he has declined, it very likely wouldn't look that way at United. And they will call us haters or false prophets lol.

"Pleased with this. He made a phenomenal impact as a super-sub under Allegri previously, and the price is very reasonable. Dybala, Chiesa and Morata should be the leaders for our attack and Kean should fit in nicely into the second category with Kulu and Berna to provide cover and competition.

"Although many have despiared over his signing, I honestly believe it's a good move.  He is only 21 so has time to grow into the player he could be.  He has apparently had discipline issues in the past, but if any team can whip in into shape in this regard, it is Juve.  He will give us a different option in front of Dybala.  He can hold the ball up well, which is perhaps the strongest part of Morata's game, but he has some attributes that Morata lacks. While not the fastest forward, Kean has great acceleration and can change direction really quickly.  He's more mobile than Morata, but perhaps not as strong in the air.  Kean does need work on the mental aspects of his game, but this is one area Allegri shines in developing in his players.  In addition to this, when Juve sign a new forward for next season (we do really need a new Talisman up front), Kean can quite happily switch to playing on the left.  He has played there quite often, and even when he plays as a centre forward, he regularly drifts out to the left.

"I think it's sad that discussions about Ronaldo usually devolved into ""Ronaldo is good"" versus ""Ronaldo is bad"" more than ""is Ronaldo good for the team?"".

I think Ronaldo is an excellent footballer, but I think that this transfer is the best thing that could happen for the team, and I have honestly wished for this for a long time. The team is way too imbalanced to handle a superstar like Ronaldo, and it needs to be strengthened in so many areas that Ronaldo's enormous salary felt like a mistake from the very beginning.

I'm very glad that he played well for Juve and scored loads of goals, but I can't help but think that the money could have been spent on building a well rounded team that could produce even better results instead, which would leave us in a better position right now. What's done is done, however, and I hope that the team becomes a proper machine now when all the players are on a more level playing field.",hamb0b0,pcq29k,Juve,2021-08-28 07:21:32,Krankelibrankelfnatt,1

They are easily threatened and not at all capable of rational thought.

Ironically, they use Ronaldo as a scapegoat for any hostility we show towards them. This is what they'll tell themselves as they go over to MU's social circle and ruin their fanbase. Let this saga be over.",hakhpca,pcn9s8,Juve,2021-08-27 23:42:59,[deleted],3

"Arrivederci. Made some good memories, even got to see a champions league match at Allianz. Overall it wasn't a successful transfer, team performance wise, as they didn't bring in anyone to support and fully utilize him.

I feel he really gave his best and at times was one of the only players who actually cared. But unfortunately, many of the fans used him as a scapegoat and would never let go of how much juve paid for him. I mean the guy literally bested ADP's best ever season in just his second season here, but somehow it always seems to be his fault. He was never truly appreciated here and I think that had played a part in his decision.

Goodbye and good luck to you, and keep in mind the next time a top talent comes here, treat them with respect and appreciate them even during the hard times.",hak2jfg,pcn9s8,Juve,2021-08-27 21:59:27,Super_Sandro23,9

"I was happy that he came, and now I’m glad that he leaves. Don’t get me wrong, Ronaldo played superbly, and I have huge respect for him and his discipline, but our Juve wasn’t, and has never been built around him. He was a pure attacker, whereas in Juve, you play for the team and not yourself. That means you go back to defend if needed, or play out of position if that’s what required. There wasn’t a support system like that for Ronaldo at Juve, there was no Marcelo or Benzema or Sergio Ramos, and even though he still scored an incredible amount of goals, the man knows that he wasn’t at his best, and he couldn’t be. 

I was very happy to see him scored, but at the same time, very often found myself frustrated to see him slowly walking back while the rest of the team rushed back to defend, as if he was playing his own game without teammates. Thus, even though he was one of the best players to have ever played for Juve, he would not be among Juve’s best.",hajo9w4,pckpc9,Juve,2021-08-27 20:04:08,melancholichamlet,17

"&gt; Ronaldo leaving produces a gap of about ~30 goals per season. Some of those will come from the midfield, other strikers might increase their production but overall I bet we will be AT LEAST 15 short, which might mean losing another league or not going far in CL, which we can't afford at all.

Yeah about that... In the 3 seasons that Ronaldo has been here the team has scored a grand total of 294 goals across all competitions (98 a season average), in the 3 seasons prior to that there were 320 (106.7 a season average), so yeah that AT LEAST 15 short is starting to look a little overexaggerated when we were scoring on average ~8 more goals a season before he joined us.",haj4hmy,pch9tc,Juve,2021-08-27 15:52:26,Wolf_Todd,8

"ITT people being surprised Ronaldo is narcissist and (likely) sociopath?

We are talking about the guy whos entire family is on mission to tell the world how precious their little boy is. A guy that, after he scores, looks at big screen to see how he looks like with cameras on him. His entire house back in his RM days was in CR7 logos, he is very much a narcissist.

And its not really a big deal what he did to Juve, its how he will look like in Utd fans eyes. He literally forced his way out, took pay cut just to go to bitter rival of club that brought him up and score couple dozen goals and be in limelight.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to appreciate Cristiano Ronaldo. The hat-trick is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the free kicks will go over a typical ~~crossbar~~ viewer's head. There's also Cristiano’ nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these stepover tricks, to realize that they're not just entertaining- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cristiano Ronaldo truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the GOATness in Ronnie’s existencial catchphrase “SSSIIIUUUU” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cristiano Ronaldo’s genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Ronaldo tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Was Paratici given the sack and Max brought back because Agnelli changed his mind about it? Basically the new management's first real job has been shipping Ronaldo out, I would find it odd if this eventuality wasn't discussed when Cherubini got promoted and Arrivabene brought on.

In any case, Ronaldo's arrival changed our recent history for better or worse, inside and outside the pitch. Will be interesting to hear what all parties involved have to say about all this in a few years.",haji8zj,pc1ank,Juve,2021-08-27 19:01:08,tigull,4

I really don't think that he was blamed for any of the losses (in UCL) during his 3 seasons except Porto which was mostly media and even then I remember over here many people (not all) said that the game was lost as a team although can't say anything about twitter.

&gt;he’s shown nothing but dedication and he always showed determination to be better than the previous years

That I 100% agree with he was one of the few that had the ""Fino Alla Fine"" spirit and the only time I didnt see it from him was during the Porto match.

"Well downvote me if you want, but only in his first season with us I saw him giving all. That was when he won us the games against Atletick. 

Beside that I just saw a guy who wants to improve his records. He gets substitutes? He’s mad. He kicked almost every freekick in the wall. He was mad if he didn’t score even if we won. Chances where he should have pass the ball, he tried to score. The game was completely changed and fit to him, which caused some player to decline because there was no space with him. He never ever convicted that he loves the team. Every year it felt like juve is his hostage because if he’s not happy he might leave. Without him we won few times the Double and had the chance to compete 2 times in the CL finale. With him just Scudetti and 1 coppa Italia, without considering how bad we were in the CL. In the Porto Games he did nothing. 

Was it all his fault? No, he is one of the best of all time and a fighter which is surrounded by mediocre player. But he gets 30 millions a season, which is a lot and they handicaped us in many ways (with Covid too ofc). I just expect more from a player who gets that money on the field and off the field.

And a lot of that gets projected on Ronaldo even though he is not at fault. Some people on this sub are clearly more open about their fanboyism, others try to hide it.

I highly doubt the majority of Juve fans even on here dislike Ronaldo. Maybe it's his fanboys that get overly sensitive and instinctively generalize the entire fanbase.

At the end of the day, I don't like his fanboys, but I think Ronaldo is still the best player in the world and they don't affect my opinion of him. I would prefer him to stay but ""only"" if he wants to. But going by all these rumors and his lack of happiness near the end of last season, I'm not sure he wants to.

"I largely agree with these. It's hard to argue with the back line, Dybala, Chiesa, and midfield paring of Rabiot and Locatelli. There are a few question marks though:

\-What is Ronaldo's best position: is it his traditional left forward position or as a central striker? We all know he likes to drift in from the left, but in Allegri's 442 or 4231 (that defends in a 442) he doesn't exactly fit the system. That would push him central, Morata out of the lineup, and Kulu into his spot - or Chiesa on left, Cuad on right with Danilo as RB.

\-Who is our best holding midfielder: Benta showed that he's much better in an advanced role against Udinese (what many on this sub have been clamoring for), and Ramsey is again injured despite - imo - playing solidly. The inclusion of Danilo is a safe option, but not sure its the best. I'm curious if Allegri whips out the Rabiot-Loca-Benta midfield in a 433. I suspect that might be our best.",ha6ms77,parhao,Juve,2021-08-25 01:15:00,zachmandu,16
"These are both awesome and I agree with both, utilizing our best players and also quite versatile. The specific players could be argued (Arthur or Rabiot or Bentancur for example) but the concepts will remain the same and I agree with your player selection.

In the 2nd one Cuadrado could push ahead and Danilo could move to RB when we are in the attacking third, similar to how Italy used Spinazzola but instead of 3atb (3-4-3) we could keep 4atb.

I think Allegri will figure it out soon, he's very adaptable and not rigid like a Conte or Sarri. The 5 subs are new for him too so we may run multiple formations throughout the game as he'll be able to switch half of the team. Excited.",ha6o94t,parhao,Juve,2021-08-25 01:24:42,huskytogo,6

"Copy / paste of my comment in the post-match thread yesterday with some add-ons.

A lot of negativity coming out of the match. It’s an unfortunate draw, but there we’re definitely some positives:
* Prime Dybala is back. Every time he touched the ball it was magic. If he continues on this path, this could be a hallmark season for him. This is the guy I fell in love with then he first joined and I’m excited to see his new found determination.
* In the initial 45 minutes, we actually pressed and held visible defensive lines. Something I didn’t see at all last year. We had a solid amount of interceptions and retrievals. “Form follows function”, and we certainly have both now.
* We can ACTUALLY counter attack and our build up play isn’t lazy, slow, or full of back passes. It’s fluid, quick, and straight to the point. Believe that both goals were scored from a quick counter attack and very direct play. Nothing we would’ve seen all of last year.
The only issue is our team isn’t just well oiled for it, a few times Morata or Benta (or someone else) was an inch too slow or just didn’t make it happen. With more practice this will get better over time.
* Yesterday was easily our weakest midfield line up for all season. I expect to see a HUGE difference once Locatelli is integrated, Rabiot is back, and Arthur is playable. Safe to say Ramsey is pretty useless, I can’t see him succeeding under Allegri either and it’s definitely time to part ways. Add to that his wages are insane, I believe more than Donnarumma is making in PSG. This was a terrible idea to bring a massively injury prone player on high wages and we’re paying for it - figuratively and literally.

Add to context:
* The two goals scored against us were due to TWO HUGE single player mistakes.
* We hit the bar at least TWICE.
* And Ronaldo’s goal was fairly/unfairly offside. Marginal…

Had Woj not fucked up, Ronaldo’s goal stood, or one of the posts hits went in, it’d be a completely different story.

To me, yesterday’s showing from an overall perspective was a HUGE improvement over what we saw from Pirlo all of last year, with practically the same team. It takes time to unlearn bad habits and relearn new ones.

Allegri takes time and needs to tinker around. We know for a fact that this team will improve over time. And if this is game one of the season, I’m VERY optimistic.",ha33wx1,pa3dz9,Juve,2021-08-24 05:55:07,visitorx_,11

"Technology should not be in place to determine down to the millimeter whether someone is offside IMO.  It’s like in basketball when the defender slaps a ball away out of bounds.  The vast majority of the time the slap away is not 100% clean and the offensive player likely grazes the ball ever so slightly as it goes out.  Usually, unless it’s blatant, the ref sides with the offensive player in a sort of “spirit of the game” sense.  

When it’s so ambiguous such as this the tie should go to the offensive player IMO.  I was unaware that a finger or hand could contribute to an offside call, but in that case it should fall in that “spirit of the game” call like in basketball.  I want technology such as VAR or instant replay to assist in getting the call right—not, however, in optimizing the sport down to the millimeter that drives all the fun of it out.",h9xy6ep,p9i4th,Juve,2021-08-23 03:11:24,IcyRay9,47

"A lot of negativity coming out of the match. It’s an unfortunate draw, but thought I’d share some positives:
* Prime Dybala is back. Every time he touched the ball it was magic. If he continues on this path, this could be a hallmark season for him. 
* In the initial 45 minutes, we actually pressed and held visible defensive lines. Something i didn’t see at all last year. We had a solid amount of interceptions and retrievals.
* We can ACTUALLY counter attack and our build up play isn’t lazy, slow, or full of back passes. It’s fluid, quick, and straight to the point.
The only issue is our team is t just well oiled for it, a few times Morata or Benta (or someone else) was an inch too slow or just didn’t make it happen. With more practice this will get better over time.
* This is easily going to be our weakest midfield line up for all season. I expect to see a HUGE difference once Locatelli is integrated, Rabiot is back, and Arthur is playable.

Add to context:
* The two goals scored against us were due to TWO HUGE single player mistakes.
* We hit the bar at least TWICE.
* And Ronaldo’s goal was fairly/unfairly offside. Marginal…

Had Woj not fucked up, Ronaldo’s goal stood, or one of the posts hits went in, it’d be a completely different story.

To me, this is a HUGE improvement over what we saw from Pirlo all of last year, with practically the same team. It takes time to unlearn bad habits and relearn new ones.

Allegri takes time and needs to tinker around. We know for a fact that this team will improve over time. And if this is game one of the season, I’m optimistic.",h9xymhs,p9hyc7,Juve,2021-08-23 03:14:42,visitorx_,64

Can't say the ref had a great game by any means, but I also can't say that Juve didn't bring the result onto themselves. Terrible game from a Szczesny who's become way too comfortable to his detriment, and too many boneheaded mistakes by the rest of the squad.

There were some promising looks, and probably driven by Allegri for sure, but when is this team going to tighten up?",h9xt6fv,p9hyc7,Juve,2021-08-23 02:35:03,JimmyCertified,4

"Honestly not even that mad. It was a decent performance from most of the team with Tek just straight up gifting two goals with the help of Ramsey getting turned into a traffic cone by Arslan. Hardly a team-wide choke and I will take it over having to watch Fiorentina home and away under Pirlo last season which was physically painful and just devoid of anything resembling quality. I disagree with the offside ruling on Ronaldo's goal too but it is what it is, not our lucky day I guess.

Dybala played well although his hold-up play could have been better, but that's more of a symptom of the team trying to force long balls when they could have slowed play down, I think Arthur returning and Locatelli getting integrated into the first team should help Juventus re-organize play from the back and keep cool under pressure.",h9yyv65,p9hyc7,Juve,2021-08-23 07:50:27,firewalkwithme-,2

Does anyone remember but the same stuff was happening during the last Allegri's season - all those points lost during the last 10 minutes or so.

"Dybala should play as an advanced midfielder imo. It's the best role possible for him, plus we could easily have Ronaldo and Chiesa as Wingers, and Morata as a forward. As for the defense, we could either have 4 defenders, or 3 with De Ligt, Chiellini and Bonucci as centre backs, Cuadrado and Kulusevski (or Alex Sandro) on the flanks, Locatelli as a playmaker, with Bentancur and McKennie as well to finish it all.

"Dybala on the left and Ronaldo as the striker? Unlikely imo, more likely Ronaldo is on the left and Dybala will be the supporting striker, or Morata will start ahead of him.

If we’re going to run with the lopsided attacker on the wing it would need to be either Berna on the left instead of right or Dybala on the right instead of left.

Good pace, nice timing, but is tecnical level is too low to play for Juve. expecially becouse he tend to play more as a forward midfielder than a backward one (as Benta, or Locatelli/Artur) 
He cannot pass more than 20 m, poor cross, no throught ball, and pretty low vision.

Juventus Football Club S.p.A. announces that an agreement with U.S. Sassuolo Calcio for

finalized.
The agreement entails the obligation for Juventus to definitely acquire the player’s registrations rights, subject to

"What a signing. Started watching him properly 2 seasons ago at Sassuolo thinking he'd grown a lot since his Milan days and that he had the potential to be a pretty good player in the future. 2 years later and he's not only a great midfield prospect but one of the league's top midfielders in his own right, and a Euro Champion.  And above all else, a Juventino, who wanted to play for this club and nothing else. He won't fix the midfield by himself but it's a great start.

"In terms of signings, I think that’ll be it for this year. Juve have to hope for stadiums to be filled enough, winning Serie A and a far enough UCL run (quarters at least) to generate enough revenue to reinvest next summer.

"i dont get it, you think it's ""crazy to rely on locatelli to make us an CL contentor"", what should we do? we simply dont have money, or goal should be to reach CL quaterfinals to get the price money, i dont want us to spend money we dont have and end up like barca, we are no CL contendor, that's the reality, allegri is a great coach and can built up a team so that we (in the best case) are a contentor in 2-3 years, i dont even think we have a bad squad, or front trio is decent with great rotation players on the bench (kulu for example), our CBs are world class, RB with danilo and de sciglio is solid, our LB is not as great but acceptable for serie a i guess, now lets look at the midfiels, ramsey didnt do that well the last season, but he might be a back up for locatelli, lets guess locatelli will play great and will be in the starting 11, rabiot also played well last season, mckennie isnt world class but puts a lot of effort on the pitch, bentancur seems to play better under allegri, if arthur is fit he also can be very good, all in all we dont have a world class midfield but at least an acceptable one, if some players are in form we even have a good/great midfield


so why exactly should we buy anyone else for the midfield, or who should we buy? covid, not getting much price money and high player wages fucked us in the last years, we have to get this straight before even thinking of making a lot/ big money transfers, lets let allegri work with the players he has, they might develop and become better, if we now buy more midfielders we end up again with the same problem, too much players (who we dont need) which gives us financial problems",h9dt1hg,p6i3zp,Juve,2021-08-18 14:46:52,maxl44,6

Also I think it would be best for us and CR7 to not extend his contract next year. He doesn't seems happy here anymore IMO plus our finances will get a breather.

All in all Locatelli move is more than I could hope for. We have good squad. I know that everyone now is on PSG and their big signings but I think they will flop big time in CL this year. Big signings don't mean much if you don't have team spirit. Give our boys more credit, I think they will do just fine under Allegri.",h9e4bsi,p6i3zp,Juve,2021-08-18 17:42:49,fenixri89,1
"I agree with you, it's ridiculous to expect a player at his first great season coming from Sassuolo to suddenly make us serious CL contenders. I really dislike how the media pumped this transfer up and how us fans got carried away with it.

I am not even sure Locatelli will be a starter, surely not at the start of the season. I think if by the end of the season he managed to get a spot in the starting 11, it'd be an amazing first year for him.

I also think nobody is next. We have no money. There will be no other incoming transfer, this summer and probably this year... unless CR7 leaves, and maybe not even then.",h9fd1bi,p6i3zp,Juve,2021-08-19 00:43:43,polokojo,1
Next summer will be all about the defense imo. Left back and probably 2 CBs. Plus the likely departure of Ronaldo will open up a place to sign a new high profile attacker.

"Sometimes things aren't as simple as blaming a team or blaming a player (this is not just for Ronaldo, I mean this in general)

We bought CR7 for 100+ million with the objective of winning the Champions league. In his tenure, we got eliminated twice from Round of 16 and once in the quarters. A lot of people make that connection to saying that he has not played well for us.  And the fact that he earns more than 5 times the next best earning player at Juve boils supporter's blood even more. That being said, we know from statistics class, correlation does not imply causation and this holds true here too. It is unfair that a section of Juve supporters blame Ronaldo for CL failures when the reality is that we could not play cohesively and were not a good enough attacking team. The only blame I would give CR7 would be the last Champions league when we got eliminated by Porto with the turning away from the free kick that Lyon took and also just not having a good enough game over 2 legs. But thats ok, he is human and mistakes can happen.

As for not having ""good"" players, we are not owned by oil-guzzling gazillionaires. If we could afford better players while enduring a sustainable financial club structure, we would! The problem of you outsider fans is that you have no idea of the history of Juventus and look at a problem very one-dimensionally. It is not a switch that the answer is as simple as an on/off button. 

I think a lot of the fans want CR7 to leave because of the enormous financial burden he is on the club rather than his performances. He has only had a select few failures at Juve, but his goal scoring record at Juventus speaks for itself. I don't think he is the *only* financial issue, but he can be thought to be one of the issues in this cash-strapped market. Hope I was able to constructively answer each of your allegations.",h9ambsl,p64k4f,Juve,2021-08-17 22:35:41,neil_ny,11
"What part isn't clear? No one here blames Ronaldo (I believe), the problem relies in the fact that juve are paying him 36 million in a pandemic time which leaves no room for squad improvement.

"Gotta admit, I'm not an optimist, guys. Even if we land Locatelli, our midfield remains under par compared to other top teams. I know there's no money and it's hard to do anything without solid finances, especially when the English teams can splash out hundreds of millions. But in that case, we should try and build a team around youngsters, instead we sell Demiral and Correia, while Dragusin was also mentioned as part of some transfer deal. I won't even comment on the return of Rugani and MdS. Ronaldo is still great but getting older by the day, Morata wastes too many opportunities, while Dybala's shape is always a mystery - he may excel, he may flop. And for the first time in 28 years I've supported Juve, we don't even have a top GK duo. Sczezsny is 7/10, Perin is 5/10 in my opinion. I believe in Allegri as a mastermind tactician, but this year he's gonna a need a magic wand.",h8rpinm,p3dh8r,Juve,2021-08-13 18:49:41,belaj_bager,0

"Do you mean the player that has performed the best in the club, the best player to ever play for the club, or the biggest club legend? I think they are separate, and 'greatest player' could technically mean any of the three. 

However, Del Piero is considered by the vast majority of Juve fans as the biggest club legend, which also makes him that. Most games, most goals, won the CL, etc. Personally, I never experienced him, so for me, it is Buffon. Maybe it is Platini for you, but objectively, it is Del Piero.

The best player has to be Ronaldo. He and Messi are the top 2 of all time (in whatever order, that's another question), and only one of then has played for Juve.

In the first case, it might be Platini, though, I think that is a very possible case to make. He might have reached a higher level than Del Piero, and Juve Platini was no doubt far better than Juve Ronaldo (but not Real Madrid Ronaldo).",h8cauyw,p1156q,Juve,2021-08-10 06:31:33,12Samwise15,5

If you ask me ""who is the greatest player to have ever played for your club"", I'd say Ronaldo. But who is OUR greatest ever player? It's a tough pick among Del P, Buffon, and Platini.

"calcio e finanza usually has a lot of good articles on these matters.

essentially the club was spending, not beyond its means, but very heavily, in an effort to win the CL at some point at the end of the decade, rather than doing a long term project. Ronaldo is the main catalyst in terms of fee+wages but the team had a [very heavy wage budget in general](https://www.rossoneriblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/serieasalaries.png), on top of other big signings like Higuain and De Ligt. 

This comes off of management handing out a lot of contract extensions to aging players, whom the club now can't get rid of to generate revenue and relieve the wage budget, so the only options are loans, or just nothing at all [such as Higuain with Sarri last season or Ramsey now]. The fact that the club were doing so many swap deals and ""creative transfers"" with other Serie A clubs for plusvalenza even while the club was making proper revenues. This also ties in with early exits from UCL, which had always been a major revenue source for Juve.

Now you have the pandemic impacting revenues greatly on top of all this overzealous spending, so you arrive at where we are at.",h85oicc,p07wgm,Juve,2021-08-08 19:01:33,firewalkwithme-,10

"Juve have been posting losses consistently I believe since 2015-16 only one positive year which was 1-2 fiscal years ago. 
We’ve been dancing in a very thin line and when you add covid it makes everything harder. 
Partners forked 200m I believe 2 years ago and now they just forked 400m that will be used to cover losses and restructure debt. 

J stadium tickets are nowhere near the amount from sponsored tv rights etc, but we are scrapping every millions and those should’ve been good but not enough. 

Remember Arthur-Pjanic exchange? All for the books, Danilo-Cancelo as well. Selling a player can be posted as a profit in the P&amp;L for the current season (helping with Financial Fair Play) but the next season Juve will have a 60m€ hole. So you cover one hole to cave one the next one. 

Juve needs to make it to 4finals and win the acuesto every season, while recording a big capital gains profit from a transfer every season until COVID hit, financial fair play announced they will take in account HALF of the losses you recorded that year, and if I’m not mistaken, Juve with the financial fair play relief would’ve been down 80-50m.

* I don’t remember the dates or the numbers exactly but you can see the financial statements. 

The 60m loss I mentioned from the Arthur-Pjanic exchange was that Juve and Barcelona valued pjanic at 60 and Arthur at 72, so only 12m of real money from juve to Barcelona was exchanged. That season both Juve a 60m positive  and a negative of 12m that season, but on the next one there was a big 60m red number in the P&amp;L. 

Now you understand why we should join the Super League. We can’t compete with PSG/EPL money. Juve is dammed geographically of playing in serie A whom hasn’t been in a good shape as of late. Sorry if it was a messy written up.",h85b2bi,p07wgm,Juve,2021-08-08 15:40:14,iker_e13,4
"Some of the comments in this thread are absolutely ridiculous.

Not spending enormous amounts of money in a summer after more than a year of revenue impacted by covid is how you build a sustainable model. Not to mention the landscape has changed considerably in a very short space of time.

"It's a culmination of several seasons worth of bad decisions and bad contracts. 

Khedira had a horrible contract, great for him but bad for juve. He wouldn't leave and he was always injured after 2 games in the season. 
Matuidi/higuain had to be bought out of their contract and then they both went to the MLS. Their quality had regressed massively.
Bad investment in Emre can. Ramsay and rabiot are overpaid because they came in on free transfer . They make as much as dybala. Dybala might be overpaid as well. Then you have Ronaldo wages. But Ronaldo might not really count either. Agnelli family used fiat to sponsor juve and with that sponsorship along with the new adidas deal they got because they got Ronaldo , most of his wages get paid there. I think this led to workers in one plant going on strike but the agnelli family still did it anyways. I believe during the musical chairs that we played in managers also doesn't help. Allegri was still under contract when we had pirlo and sarri, when we sacked sarri he still had to get paid and same with pirlo. Juve was bleeding money with bad contracts but most of that is gone now. In about 1-2 seasons they will be better financially.",h85atrq,p07wgm,Juve,2021-08-08 15:36:52,BatosaiGeneral,2

I watched every game he played in for Juventus and Turkey, I even saw some of his games pre Juventus and he was seriously talented. He benched De Ligt before his injury and De Ligt is our strongest defender.

It's a real shame to see him go. Although I guess at least we lessen our fanboy load with the Turkish Demiral fanatics going. Just the Ronaldo and De Ligt nut huggers now lol.

Express our deepest apologies for the post that 'read' as racially discriminatory? Nothing about it has to do with how it's read. It's blatantly racist and the social media managers should be fired and the player suspended.

We have 2 players who do similarly as what rabiot is doing which is dybala and Morata (get the ball deep in the middle) locatelli might need a sheilder instead. People say mckennie isn't good for that but if allegri says so, he is good. The system of two holding midfielders isnt fully revised or reveled by allegri still so we don't know what will happen, if loca playes jorgenioh style play, I see benta fit in good, if he played a Verrati style we may need a pure destroyer. Cris depends on how he will really play there, I don't see him there as a good way except for cuadrado crosses. Litrelly only thing. Morata still needs to be there for pressing and chiesa I see him better at left, kulu also important to also help cuadrado when he attacks and defends, we need to cover the right side as alexsandro covers left.

Best line up but balance is a bit off . As shown in 2017 this is not feasible on the long run without wingers willing to sacrifice and a very high stamina coc. Dybala and Ronaldo's difensive workrates unfortunately aren't as high as chiesa or Morata's.

"Allegri is a top manager , but not the best , his last season he showed that he can't take that team to any other level ,  it was going down if he continued , while he took us to UCL finals , Juventus crashed hard in those Finals , not to mention huge losses ( bayern munich , Real Madrid in Knockouts ) and losses to teams like Manchester United  and Ajax ( Ajax that lost to tottenham ) .

whats the common factor in most of his UCL losses ? too much planning ( keeping players in reserve ...etc ) , and use of Players that can't handle the other Team , one example is the Manchester United game ( 2018-2019 ) , mourinho throw in Mata &amp; Fellaini  and win the game , because he had to bring in Barzagli  to play as a rightback , which backfired immediately

so he has those moments , and i imagine in his sabbatical he studied his problems and may have fixed it , or it would get worse , we don't know

Somehow his playing style reminds me of Aguero,h7gwodi,ovomd9,Juve,2021-08-03 04:17:04,Apprehensive_Media24,1
Will he be a top player or a disappointing one (like many others)?,h7antkc,ovomd9,Juve,2021-08-01 17:10:36,Tafkasdd,-11
"It's only 2 preseason matches but really like Soule, Ranocchia, Fagioli (of course), and Felix Correia. De Sciglio has been solid too but that's not saying much. Really hope we keep those 4 from loan outs so we can see them come on as subs and get some playing time. They deserve it!",h79vdou,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 11:08:57,JimmyCertified,8
"Why tf are people criticizing Allegri in this thread?  


While I hoped he would leave two years ago, the guy is the best on the market for the job. Fuck off with being negative a month away from oficial matches.",h78xobh,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 06:00:57,Lordofs1n,26

Allegri wins a trophy after only his second match of the season! What a manager.,h78pxch,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 04:54:40,droidonomy,33
"Second half impressions
Fagioli &gt; Pjanic + Ramsey. Smart moves, great vision.
Kulu wants to play and ready to play anywhere - very good game.
De winter - nice defensive and offensive. Might become our number one right back
Felix, Ake and Miretti - promising. Lots of energy but lacking maturity, maybe next year…
Rabiot - solid but need still to work hard
De sciglio - also good on the left.
The rest - nothing special.",h78pwlo,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 04:54:30,Ktulu_Juventus,16
Sexy goal by Monza. Kudos.,h78oz6z,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 04:46:44,daddytorgo,9
"I love watching Fagioli play. Guy looks like a seasoned midfielder and is always looking to do something positive, even when not on the ball.

I'd rather see him get minutes than bring back Pjanic.",h78oyu9,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 04:46:39,droidonomy,35

Beans is so proactive with his passing...love it.,h78nns8,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 04:35:32,daddytorgo,10

"First half impressions - Kulu and Soule are good together, lots of creativity, hard work and flexibility. Rannochia really good, potentially very nice midfielder. De ligt, Demiral, Sczesny - solid. De Schilio promising. Ramsey received new role and not sure he can do it. The rest - not impressive half.",h78j23a,ovcydo,Juve,2021-08-01 03:56:49,Ktulu_Juventus,8
