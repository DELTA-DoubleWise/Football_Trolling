"1. Hakimi has to start from now on (we knew that already)
2. Sensi over Eriksen.

&gt;Even an absolute banter team like Man U can still drag themselves out of their stupor, at least temporarily, and get up for the Champions League. Despite being a joke of a club, they still manage to pull themselves together momentarily with two strong performances against very respectable opposition in the CL.

We're the same drunk, deadbeat dad minus the occasional moments. When we see our kids birthday on the calendar, we talk a big game about buying them a great present and taking them out to Disney World and then we get cold feet like a sad cunt and don't show up.

"It's not a mistake imo, Godin was disappointing last year, he had a maximum of 5 or 6 good games the entire year and he was benched eventually by Bastoni, so he became a solid backup nothing more and you can't have a player who earns 5 or 6m as a backup, and let's not forget that the reason he was sold was to bring Vidal in, why do we have to offload a player for free to get another one for free ? you have the covid pandemic to thank for that.

The problem is we could have easily played DD33 Ranocchia De Vrij Kolarov today and not start Perisic as Lwb as he has clearly shown he is shit in that position but no Conte chose to play 3atb with 1cb available and we already saw how that turned out against Fiorentina and it's no surprise the laughable defending we saw today.

ps: I know Ranocchia is shit but he would't have been as disastrous today as Kolarov since he would be playing next to De Vrij in 4atb and covered by DD33 and not too exposed so imo that would have minimized chances of a terrible defensive performance.",g94yaop,jd12gc,FCInterMilan,2020-10-18 04:25:09,Lothar18,11

- Eriksen as always seems asleep, plays too much like a precious princess instead of actually fighting for the team

- Ref and VAR were shitshows

"I hate the most when coaches just stick to past the 1 hour mark and beyond to make first change. At half time was the perfect time to bring on Eriksen. And shortly after for Sanchez. That way you give time for the changes to have an impact. What is Eriksen with 20 mins and Sanchez on 10 mins going to do?

Also I said it before and say it again, fuck Kolarov. Can't believe we played DAmbrosio and him in a 3 men defence. Ibra, Leao and others what they way with our defence. I'm truly beyond frustrated. 

Perisic was beyond trash against Calabria. Lukaku is also annoying to watch how 1 dimentional he is and he got owned by his strength. He had few moments where he used pace. Lautaro was shit and no link up play with Lukaku. 

Milan players wanted it more, every 50/50 they won and the ball always found their players. Also their players where efficient and creative on the final 3rd whilst we had players who's brain froze and wasted the chance.

Fuck this game, ruined our winning streak against them.",g94iblr,jczuqd,FCInterMilan,2020-10-18 02:10:50,Dusty_philosopher,2

Brozovic was clearly struggling, the midfield needed something as our play was terrible.

Also this is why it is fucking idiotic why you don't play 2 fullbacks in a 3 men defence. Kolorov second game he has made terrible mistakes, DAmbrosio as much as I love the dude he sucks. Passing the ball straight at Milan players.

"People keep downvoting comments criticizing Conte but if Conte wasn't a fucking stubborn idiot and could play different formations we wouldn't have Kolarov playing as a left centerback and maybe we wouldn't have conceded the 2 goals. I don't see how anyone can defend Conte, he chose Kolarov for that position after showing how terrible he is at defending. I'm sick of seeing this 3-5-2 shit when we don't have the players for it. We can't fucking play 3 centerbacks and only have one of them that's good at defending. Especially when both of the wingbacks are more offensive minded.   


This is all on Conte. Kolarov isn't a fucking centerback. You can clearly see even in this game he's much better going forward than defensively.",g94h779,jcwm18,FCInterMilan,2020-10-18 02:01:35,Double-Knee,8

"Couldn't watch it but I've seen the 2 goals and the sensi red card (ridiculous considering there's var). It's not like tying lazio is the worst result in the world, but if we played much better and tied due to our mistakes then I hope things are sorted out soon. Reading that we've played key players out of position just makes me angry, tbh.

"Pathetic. From start to finish. Nothing ever changes. Absolutely categorically clear we won't win anything this year and that it's pointless hoping. Other than Vidal, our transfer market has been scandalous, yet again. Hakimi is massively overrated. Also our defence has gone from being pretty tight to being ridiculous. Atalanta tore this same Lazio team apart a couple of days ago. We didn't even dominate them for a single minute. Juventus will have the league wrapped up by the end of March. And it would be better for all of us if the club actually came out and admitted this instead of trying to get us all excited and optimistic to make money off of us. Shameful.",g7oxzjt,j508yz,FCInterMilan,2020-10-05 00:21:25,czarnyniebieski,-42
"Terrible result, but I think there's a few decent enough takeaways as a learning experience.
1. Barella is wasted up the field.
2. Vidal and Gagliardini in a double pivot actually kind of worked, but I think that's to be expected when the times he's succeeded, it's been next to Kondogbia or Kessie.
3. If you really wanted that physical double pivot, seems like the perfect opportunity to use either Sensi or Eriksen for most of the match. Maybe Conte felt like he needed to confirm point 1.
4. Skriniar isn't terrible in a back 3 when the RWB is actually good.
5. Perisic is a player that I have a soft spot for, but he's not going to excel in this role. In theory, it felt like with his work ethic and his effective back pressure, LWB could work, but you can pin the Lazio goal solely on his shoulders, IMO.
6. Would feel a lot better with another CB. Seeing de Vrij limp around at times...we're going to be boned if any of the starters get hurt.",g7owa9m,j508yz,FCInterMilan,2020-10-05 00:07:06,FriedSeabass,26
"Leaving another comment because I'm seeing way too many saying ""it's Conte's fault, shouldn't have started Gagliardini and shouldn't have played barella as a Trequartista"". And I just... Really, really disagree? Today our midfield was probably the part of our team that worked the best, the main mistakes were in how we handled our plays in their penalty area, way too many Candreva-style crosses from Perisic, and as usual a few wasted chances we should have buried instead. Our midfield worked much better than usual (even thanks to Vidal who was immense today), so...

...If you think Conte is at fault **this** time, feel free to do so. But if your reason for it is because of our midfield, then I just can't agree with you, saying our midfield was the problem today is just plain wrong, come on.",g7ovrsd,j508yz,FCInterMilan,2020-10-05 00:02:48,5kyLegend,21
"I like Conte, and I think talk of sacking him is pretty stupid. With that said, the man just continues to perplex me. Last season, he often refused to play 3-4-1-2, which forced Eriksen to either play out of position or come on late as a sub. This season, he‚Äôs determined to play a 3-4-1-2 but puts Barella in the 10 role and has Gagliardini starting? Gags didn‚Äôt play poorly today imo, but when the midfield options include Vidal, Barella, Sensi, Eriksen, and Brozovic, Gagliardini should be a *distant* sixth option. There‚Äôs no way he should be starting key matches. It‚Äôs silly",g7ou9x4,j508yz,FCInterMilan,2020-10-04 23:49:51,Dgryan87,28

"Should've never started Perisic. Should've never started Barella as a trequartista. Why does Conte insist on 3-4-1-2? If we play it we need an actual trequartista like Sensi or Eriksen   


Subbing off Skriniar for D'ambrosio? I get he's known for scoring these late headers but that's a waste of a sub when we're 1 man up. Should've kept Lautaro on and subbed on Alexis for Vidal or Gagliardini. Brozovic should've started too.   


I put the blame all on Conte. What a shit match. Also Sensi thing wasn't a red card. Why it wasn't recalled by VAR, I'll never know. If that's a red card most games should end by disqualification for too many sent off players

Perisic is as good a wing back as last year in preseason when we shipped him off, so that's cool to see. Had no clue SMS was right there. A proper LWB is needed next season, no excuses.


Hakimi was too underutilized - Brozo should have started so we could have switched the ball wide more, Atalanta ripped Lazio apart last week doing just that.

"1. Sanchez is the only one sending passes towards Hakimi. Can our CBs not see him making his runs on the right?
2. Lukaku did good today but barely any good scoring positions for him.
3. Lautaro did okay but he lacks the game vision Sanchez has.
4. Brozo tries too little advancing passes...
5. Play Sanchez under the 2 strikers, he does defensive work and is a few levels beyond the rest of the squad when it comes to game vision.

"Brozovic has been unwatchable this season so far. I don't care if he's done a lot for us in the past, but with this attitude he shouldn't be seeing the pitch, Gaglia has been better than him. Messing up simple passes, bad positioning, slowing down plays that should be much faster instead... That, and Perisic aside from the dribbling before our goal did nothing during the entire match, and he even caused Lazio's goal (by absolutely messing up his marking, together with Handa's bad positioning on the goal).

All in all, we drew but the team did not play badly at all, in my opinion. We just need for Handa to wake up a little because he hasn't really been his usual self lately, and Brozo and Perisic have been disappointing me. We should really tell every midfielder in our team to always look for Hakimi by the way, our most dangerous plays always go by him.",g7oprws,j508yz,FCInterMilan,2020-10-04 23:08:05,5kyLegend,6

"1 point against Lazio isn‚Äôt the end of the world but the game was well within our reach. Gg to Lazio for canceling Hakimi from the game and being pretty solid at the back.

The difference in these types of games comes down to finishing the chances you get. Lukaku misses a pretty good look at goal meanwhile SMS sneaks in an improbable header. Handa could have done better there.

"I think everyone really likes Milan Skriniar and so do I and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs staying at Inter. But Conte REALLY needs to work on adapting Skriniar to his back 3. It‚Äôs honestly hard to watch how much he struggles sometimes, and this was just Benevento.

"What I saw today:
1. Galia looked really good, he might be enough for these type of games.
2. Sanchez is amazing as a playmaker.
3. Hakimi seems to be worth the money er paid. Let's hope he will continue to show this level of play.
4. Possesion in the back is not working well this season. I think they should try for a long ball way sooner in many plays.
5. Kolarov is not good enough in defense to be a part of a solid back 3.",g77b7e7,j2r5ur,FCInterMilan,2020-10-01 02:47:23,RED_DIAMOND_8,18

"My takeaways from this expected win against admittedly a pretty weak side.

* Sanchez should become a trequartista or even a mezz‚Äôala. It‚Äôs been clear for some time that he‚Äôs better at creating than scoring. He has great chemistry with Hakimi.
* Confirmation that Hakimi is world class and will make the difference for us this season.
* Vidal was a great signing. I love his energy.
* Our defense is still weak and we need to figure something out before we face the big dogs.

9 goals scored in first 2 games. We have the potential to be not only a winning team, but an entertaining one too.

Given the overall discussion in this thread, the fact that the only moderator comment discussing the issue is downvoted, it might be a good idea to put words where your mouth is. And this is not meant in a derogatory way.

It has been mentioned more than once that, when making rules and applying rules, you follow the community's guideline and ideas. 

Perhaps it is a perfect time to create a poll to ask the sub's opinion of the overall level of toxicity and if they think toxicity should be punished harder or more frequently.

In that case you have a perfect answer in future scenarios.

Also, consider the fact we will be lucky to reach top 4 in Seria A this season and all in all Conte sent us like 5 years backwards (because Conte ain't leaving without the money).

So basically our only hope for a bright future is for Conte and a few of the idiote he brought with him like Kolarov and Vidal to suddenly die, releasing us from any obligation to pay them.",gdn3s8k,k11usn,FCInterMilan,2020-11-26 16:29:06,RED_DIAMOND_8,1

When you're a Conte favorite, you can do the Trump ""shoot someone on 5th Avenue and not lose any voters"" thing.

Wow he makes it look like we are Serie B team who have no business at this level and should frankly be content with just competing. How embarrassing for a supposed top coach to say this?

"This is one of the most humiliating games for Inter, it was absolutely embarassing wtf was that ? and here I was hoping for a season turn around, in all honesty I am beginning to agree with a lot of ppl on this sub about how we are wasting our best years and our best squad in a long time with a manager like Conte, I've tried being patient with him, I defended him when I thought he was receiving unfair criticisim and I criticized him a lot also especially during the start of this season, I tried to shift a little of the blame to the players also but in all honesty when a team plays like we have been playing and with the squad available, it's always the manager's fault. This was the worst Real in the past decade by far and they were missing Ramos, Real without Ramos becomes a joke they only won once without him in the last 8 games in UCL, but against us they won and got a clean sheet too. We as fans don't deserve this, a club like Inter doesn't deserve this humiliation, what's even more infuriating is Atalanta won in Anfield against Liverpool while we have been an absolute embarassement in Europe.

I wanted Conte out in the summer after he publically insulted the club but that didn't happen and as soon as he was confirmed for this season I started supporting him but now I have lost faith in him, don't get me wrong I hope he can salvage this situation and I will be the first one to admit I was wrong for losing faith in him but at this moment in time I don't think he's gonna turn this around.",gdllvv3,k11tse,FCInterMilan,2020-11-26 06:32:25,Lothar18,19

"Back when we had Spalletti, he had to wake the fuck up, and so did our players who looked like they couldn't give less of a shit about the Champions League.

Now, I'm feeling exactly the same. I know Conte will be the one who will be bashed and many will ignore how SO many players don't even look like Serie A players, let alone CL ones. Conte needs to wake the fuck up and realize that whatever he changed in tactics from last year hasn't been working one bit. It's not a matter of 3 or 4 defenders, it's a matter of we can't build up any play anymore, and we have to rely on Barella and Lukaku bailing our asses most of the time. ***BUT*** our players also need to wake the fuck up, it's embarrassing how little most of them seem to care. I'm too tired to even write a list, but it would honestly be easier to name the ones who've been playing well lately. Even if we kick Conte out, THESE players won't go anywhere. Even if we change players, THIS coach won't make us go anywhere. And it's not because they're all bad, it's because - as I mentioned a few times already - ***they need to wake the fuck up and realize they're all throwing away a season***.

Rant over. I said, before the match, that negativity before we play is useless. I support Inter. I always have, and I always will. So I will ALWAYS root for our boys when we have a match. And I'm not going to root for Conte, for Eriksen, or whoever else some fans are whiteknighting and fighting over. I support Inter, and what's good for our team. Right now, what's good for us is for everyone to start playing and coaching like they CARE. So wake the fuck up, fans ALL over the world are tired of our team and our coach being spineless whenever it fucking matters.

Edit: as usual I get downvotes for this sort of opinion. But if your take is that the ONLY problem right now is kicking Conte away and suddenly we'll start doing well again, then I think you're either too much of an optimist, or you're trying to look away from the actual problems we have. 10 years of saying the coach is the only one in the wrong and the poor players aren't used correctly, look where that brought us.",gdliwo7,k11tse,FCInterMilan,2020-11-26 06:05:48,5kyLegend,1

"We are 5th in the league and dead last in a more than accessible CL group with no wins. Last year's team would have destroyed us. 

Piss poor mercato (apart from Hakimi), gave away Godin for no good reason, brought Kolarov for no good reason and Vidal's experience has been disastrous. Pinamonti has been exiled to another dimension, probably for the cardinal sin of costing 20M in a buyback agreement and helping in ruining Conte's career mode shopping list for this season. Let all of our targets go to our rivals and we would have shipped off Skriniar or Brozo if we'd had the chance.

I hope management sees reason (and the Zhangs open up their purses if needed) and it doesn't come to a point where we're struggling to get top4.

"My thoughts are: if you are a good manager, you can and must adapt with what you have. It takes time, but is doable if you put the effort in. We're not talking about Gagliardini, we're talking about Eriksen. He's a very good asset, and you can and must adapt, see the potential and try something else.

In fact, I don't think Conte is a good manager.

Managers should be leaders first, tacticians second. Conte has a non-existing leadership, and can barely adapt tactics throughout a season. In fact he only uses the Conte System‚Ñ¢  we all know, and he's dead set. If it works, it works well. But we can all see, it's not working for quite some time now.

I get it, he didn't want Eriksen. But his job is not fighting with the board, his job is to manage the team, whatever it is. For the last few months, it really seems like  the former, and it really really looks unprofessional, childish and the opposite of what a leader should do.",gdfft7q,k028r0,FCInterMilan,2020-11-24 18:34:17,Dr_Gonzo__,39

"It really doesn‚Äôt make sense in my mind. Di Marzio said that Conte wanted Eriksen, because he called him and talked to him, contrary to what the press was/is saying. Then, after the lockdown, in his words Conte said: ‚ÄúEriksen is such a great guy, you can‚Äôt not like him‚Äù. After the lockdown we had the game against Napoli in which he‚Äôs done very well if you ask me, then blackout. I understand that both Conte and Mourinho had the same opinion about him, he doesn‚Äôt run that much, yet you cannot judge a player only by that. I don‚Äôt have anything against Gagliardini, but I don‚Äôt see why Conte wants him so bad over Eriksen, or even other players over him. 
I liked Conte in his first season, though I feel he is very predictable tactically and right now, we have seen how much we‚Äôve been suffering this seasons because of his predictability. 
I support the team, coach, board and players all the way, but are we sure that Conte is the right choice as of now? We have Hakimi who is not performing that well, Eriksen is not playing, Radu is not getting at least a chance though Handanovic played bad in the games up to Torino (maybe with a few exceptions) and we gave Godin away just to bring in Vidal (which I like, but still). 

P.s. now they‚Äôre talking about a trade between Inter and Real for Eriksen &amp; Isco, though the Spaniard would be Eriksen 2.0",gdfyety,k028r0,FCInterMilan,2020-11-24 22:04:40,steven_echo07,2

"Might get downvoted to oblivion but I m with Conte on this Eriksen situation, I used to say in the summer that we need to give him chances this year and wait for him to prove his qualities but he hasn't done that, I've given up on him just a few games into this season, he contributes with nothing and all he does is when he gets the ball he passes it back and he can't seem to be able to play under pressure at all, the second an opponent comes near him he loses the ball, I've seen a lot of talk about how Conte should play him as a regista but Conte said in the last interview he can't play there and I agree because Eriksen cannot play under pressure at all he can't make simple dribbles and he surely cannot drive the ball forward and that position also requires recovering balls, and he's also very lazy.

I know he's among the players who have gotten the least amount of minutes but he has started numerous games this season and he has shown nothing and all the times he was rightfully subbed out, do you guys remember one certain player we bought named Barella and he wasn't getting enough minutes and he would only come on at the 75th or 80th minute during the first games but he used those little chances to prove his worth and starting the fourth game of the season against Milan he became and indisputed starter and one of our best players, Why can't Eriksen do that ?

I really wanted this transfer to work out when it happened but it's a shame it turned out this way, and I think the best thing is to sell him in the winter and get a midfielder who will fit.",gdfln45,k028r0,FCInterMilan,2020-11-24 20:07:07,Lothar18,6

"Fine by me. It was a good purchase at the time, we had good economy, he was the best avaliable midfielder. 

But honestly, it takes two to tango, Eriksen hasnt been a world class player for years and while we all hoped for a restart when he switched clubs it hasnt happened. I think you can blame covid, it isnt easy to fit into a club in january when covid happens and you dont even speak italian. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have moved on, Barella is immense, Vidal is great, Broz still got enough juice and we can hope Sensi gets his  form back instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he is misplayed by Conte, no doubt. Eriksen should sit deep, have a lot of time on the ball and distribute balls, not play in the final third as Conte has been using him. But you also got to blame Eriksen, he is too poor defensively to play as a centre midfielder in Contes system and honestly all he has to do do then is run and press more, that only takes determination, not skill. 

&amp;#x200B;

"I‚Äôll copypaste the comment of u/yaniv297 in the r/soccer subreddit, because are my exact thoughts: 
Mentions another user: ‚ÄúInstead Eriksen picked Inter (fuck knows why) and has done nothing but let his stock fall. He should've had the intelligence and foresight to talk with Conte, in depth, about what his role at Inter was going to be.‚Äù

The comment: ‚ÄúI agree with most of your post, but not this bit. I think Eriksen makes tactical sense in Inter - he's perfect for the number 10 in 3-4-1-2, and can also play in the midfield three of a 3-5-2 and be effective there. He also used to be one of the greatest workhorses in the league, even outrunning Kante one season, so he should be able to handle Conte's fitness demands. I don't think it's a tactical issue, I think Eriksen simply failed to perform and that's why he was dropped.

It's getting hard to explain, but I'm thinking it's not a ""subconscious"" thing either. I kinda thing we just ran him to the ground. He's been playing pretty much ever minute he was fit since he was 18 at Ajax, and particularly in 18-19 he was playing literally all the time, running like mad, usually out of position when everyone around him were changing because of injuries. To me, it reminds me of Rooney - who kinda lost his legs early in his career too. It's also possible that his confidence might be shot from how everything turned out, and I've even seen suggestions he has depression (he does kinda seem the type, tbh) - but honestly, if I have to guess I just don't think he's the same player anymore.

"There is a lot to blame to go around for this. 

1.  Conte for not being able to integrate him probably and unable to EVER adjust his tactics. Stuck on the same formation week in and week out. That being said, I think Barella fits that specific role better. 

2.  Management for bringing him in the first place. They have brought in a lot of players.  A lot of old players.  Players at the request of Conte.  Some curious choices since January. Erikson, Kolarev, Darmian.  Not signing Tonali and going in this older direction. Win now mode. 

3.  Erikson. He had something to prove after leaving Tottenham. He was not playing well and moved to Inter to rejuvenate his career and he hasn't done that.  I'm sure he hasn't gotten the amount of opportunities he would like but he hasn't shown anything in his limited time.

Anyway, we won. We didn't really deserve to. But I hope this is the match that shows to our players and to Conte that playing THAT slow, moving that little, and being that boring is NOT working. This match has shown that our biggest problem right now is our heads, since the moment we start running we score 4 goals.

Not knowing the results I just checked this thread and surprise surprise, we are behind and a shit player like Zaza scoring against us.

Also nice to see Eriksen on the bench and Conte preferring to play passion &amp; players who can run, over someone who can make us win/add creativity to our game.

If Conte gets sacked sometime this season or leaves us end of the season, I hope he never gets a top job. I hope all top clubs can see what a spineless regressive idiot he is.",gd83i57,jyv9uz,FCInterMilan,2020-11-22 23:10:58,Dusty_philosopher,3

"Good choice! We have a long history, full of ups and downs. You can check out wikipedia for details.

In terms of our recent history, you can think of it in terms of pre and post Moratti (our ex owner). Under Moratti's ownership Inter grew a lot and between 2006-2010 we won five consecutive scudetti, culminating with the Treble in 2010. What followed was a decade of complete mediocrity, caused in part by financial issues within the club. From to 2013 to 2016 club ownership began a major transition with Moratti slowly selling off to Thohir and ultimately selling full ownership to Suning, a major Chinese conglomerate.

In the last 3 seasons we began pulling ourselves out of our slump. We had some pretty major management changes, particularly the hiring of Marotta as sporting director and Conte as coach. We have slowly been improving the squad and this season we were finally supposed to be title contenders once again. So far the season has been very underwhelming. Many doubt Conte, but it's still early in the season.

"Lmao I absolutely disagree with your take. Icardi was a star finisher in a decent team. Once he had a defender man-marking him, he couldn't do anything, had 12 ball contacts per game. We essentially played with 10 players. However, as soon as he got a half chance, he buried it. He dragged the team, but he didn't improve it. He is way more clinical and deadly than Lukaku, but it is definitely Lukaku who improves the team around him more. I'll also concede that Icardi was the one showing up in all the big games, a task now split between Lautaro (Juve, Barca, Milan, Napoli, Real) and Lukaku (Napoli, Sevilla, Leverkusen). I think we could do well in a 4-2-3-1 with Eriksen behind Icardi, but Icardi wouldn't work in a two striker system.     

My own unpopular opinion:
We could do serious damage with a 4-3-1-2.    
Parameters:    
- one offensive, one defensive fullback    
- Brozovic as regista, staying low, not pressing in the opposition box    
- 2 out of Skriniar, De Vrij, Bastoni **always playing**, maybe even try Bastoni as LB with Hakimi on the other side    
- Vidal/Sensi LCM, Barella must as RCM    
- Eriksen with freedom and facing/creating towards, not with the back to the goal    
- Same strikers, and trying to develop Pinamontis hold up play similar to Lukaku",gbx8xr3,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 18:21:58,head_in_the_clouds69,16
My unpopolar opionion is that Lautaro isn't a top tier striker and won't be one. I just don't find him having a lot of qualities. To me he doesn't start in a top team and even hasn't the potential to become a player of that level,gbxb2d2,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 19:00:23,Rava23,9

"Icardi is better in everything exept the main thing Romelu does for us. We can get the ball to him in every situation and he can shield it for how long he wants and that's a crucial part of our gameplan.

He also looks like a great teammate",gbxazdx,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 18:58:55,Rava23,2
"Short answer: my opinion is that we aren't a top team yet and we aren't even close to have built one. People say we have Lukaku, Barella, Eriksen, Lautaro, Bastoni, etc... so we must win everything, but single players don't make a team.

Long answer: we should aim to a longer term team-building strategy rather than getting some ""quick wins"", and we need a coach that matches this idea and that's so obviously not Conte. We have a good youth ""system"" and we should take advantage of it, I think we're trying too hard to be a team that wins by buying some ""exprienced"" players rather than investing in the future.

I'd like to see a team that invests in younger players and that tries different play styles and tactics.

"I actually respect your opinion. In terms of raw talent and skill it's hard to deny that Icardi is the superior player. Before his spectacular fallout with us, I genuinely thought he was a special player when it came to goal scoring. He definitely had star power too, showed up in difficult moments. 

Many will say that Lukaku makes up for it by being more involved in build up and more of a team player. And while I agree that he *tries* to do those things more than Icardi did, he's not particularly good at it.

In Lukaku's defense however, he is not put in the position to express himself at his best, whereas Icardi has a whole team build to serve him. I want to reserve judgement until I see Lukaku put in the position to run at defenses and use all his speed and power. Hopefully our next coach will allow this to happen.",gbyqto0,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-12 03:32:35,PastaMastah,2
"I don‚Äôt agree with your viewpoint, but it‚Äôs more than ok to disagree. Let me explain my take on it -&gt;

Let‚Äôs start with how Icardi and Lukaku are two different types of strikers. In a combination, they would‚Äôve been a great pair, yet Icardi‚Äôs wife brought a lot of instability to the group of players and the club overall. On the other hand, Lukaku brings stability and he needs a lot of love from the team in order to perform at his best, which he receives. 

Icardi played most of the times as the sole striker with Inter; Lukaku played in a pair with Lautaro/Sanchez, and we have to realize, again, they played/play different roles in the team. 

Let me remind everyone something: Icardi was not sold because he hasn‚Äôt performed well. He was sold because of his manager (his wife) and the way he abandoned the team mid season because of an ‚Äúinjury‚Äù. There‚Äôs no player bigger than the team, and Icardi experienced that. And just as a fact, look at how Icardi is performing right now and how he‚Äôs not playing.",gbzvk6x,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-12 09:47:09,steven_echo07,2
"Conte was never the right man for the job, especially after what happened in his second season with Chelsea.",gbxewg0,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 20:05:07,19081919,3
"While I agree that Icardi is one of the best players in the box, being able to convert a ridiculus % of occasions, I don't think he improved the team. For him to be so effective he needs to be fed every ball, and the team must play for him, and him only. Lukaku allows for a different kind of play. I think both could be effective, but what Icardi could've brought on field, we would have lost outside, with all the drama. I'm not sure Icardi can work well with a 2 men attack anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal unpopoular opinion is that Inter should sell De Vrij, and we are a bit late in that actually. This has nothing to do with the current dip in form he is experiencing, best time to sell was last summer, as he probably reached his peak being nominated best Serie A defender. This has been a thought of mine since when Conte was not so sure to stay. Almost all the managers available would have passed to a 4 at the back formation, so selling De Vrij, who is better in a 3ATB, would have made sense, as  we could have fielded a right footed CB in Skriniar and a left footed CB in Bastoni, both of them being very good and younger than De Vrij. Obviously, we should have brought in replacement, but just just as a rotation option. Even with Conte, selling De Vrij for big money (like the rumored 70M City was ready to offer for Napoli's Koulibaly) and replacing him with the likes of Milenkovic or even cheaper options like Izzo and moving Skriniar in the center of the 3 defenders, would have allowed for a better squad overall, because the remaining 20-30M from his sale could've been spent in areas where we are currently lacking certain players.",gbx9aar,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 18:28:21,Rhaenys59,2

"Icardi is a great finisher and I often wonder how many games we would've won last season if it was Icardi in those positions rather than Lukaku.

"Icardi faster than Lukaku?? That's a big no from me mate, Lukaku has an impressive acceleration while Icardi never outran anyone. Besides Icardi spent entire games just scratching his balls near the opponents' defense line, barely moving an inch. He was nigh useless in buildup or creating interesting attack situations because he offered nothing. Subbing in Lautaro the last 10 minutes would instantly create double the chances we had with Icardi the previous hour. He can't dribble and he isn't fast, he has decent technique I'll give him that, but Lukaku is just better at almost everything.",gbxevwm,js5d93,FCInterMilan,2020-11-11 20:04:53,BlueHeartbeat,1

"Lots to be said, from lack of confidence, lack of tactics from the coach, lack of focus from the players.

But had Handa actually saved a shot he was supposed to get for a keeper of his rank, we would be talking about a hard fought win right now. No other team has stats as awful as us when it comes to the ""opponent's shots:opponent's goals"" ratio. Like, fuck off, 2 shots on target for Atalanta, 1 goal.

We're boring and depressing to watch, yes, and I am thankful for all Handa has done for us: HE is one of the big reasons why we went to CL last year. But right now he's also a huge reason why we have this awful amount of goals scored against. I'm aware this may bring down votes since Conte will be the hot topic today, but...

"It's hard to single out one moment in 25 years of being a fan of black and blue. The easy answer is 22 May 2010, the day we won the CL, on my birthday!  
But there are so many moments I cherish and that I want to both share and recall to your memories, in no particular order.  
El Chino Recoba brace on Ronaldo's debut (fanboy since that day), Youri Djorkaeff bicycle kick, Seedorf bombing brace against Juve and Buffon, Belozoglu Emre's brace and performance in a crazy comeback against Lazio (to this day probably the closest game to an undisputable 10 that I've seen out of any player wearing our jersey), handing Juve their first loss at Rube stadium in a Stramaccioni's masterclass, ""Toldo's goal"", winning the Italian Supercup in yet another crazy comeback and dedicating it to Giacinto Facchetti in 2006, 2009 4-0 derby, Baggio's brace against Real Madrid and many many others!  


And then there are the personal moments: meeting our then captain Beppe Bergomi in 1995 when he came to my hometown, meeting Ronaldo at Solletico (Italian kids tv show during the 90s), going to San Siro the first time (Inter-Empoli 4-1), receiving my first Inter jersey as a kid (Paul Ince!) and buying my first Inter jersey (Chino Recoba of course!), my girlfriend telling me in a moment I needed a motivational boost that she is my ""Curva Nord"", [going to Malpensa](https://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/champions/2010/04/29/news/inter_bagno_di_folla_a_malpensa_cori_per_tutti_tranne_balotelli-3695958/) to greet the team after we ""beat"" Barcelona in 2010 (I and my brother are in the picture) and an uncountable number of games I've watched that gave me those special Inter vibes over the years.

"Inter fans since 2000s, many ups &amp; downs, been through glory era &amp; banter era.

UCL Final 2010 &amp; Triplete will always be my favorite, but for some reason winning the 2nd leg against Barca feel so memorable for me. The pressure &amp; relief at the end of the match, also I've seen photo of Inter fans in Milano welcoming the squad like crazy after return. At that time I already feel that we'll win CL for sure. Another honorable mention also derby won 4-0 in that season, the joy, the emotion, it was so ecstatic. That performance makes me believe that we can beat any team at that time (and it proved).

Another memorable moment, even tho it's a tragic one, was 5 May 2002. You know what's happened that day. I was still kid and really hope for Inter scudetto yet the result gave me a major letdown. I was burst into tears after the full time whistle. Though for some reason that lost makes me love Inter more and I decided to keep supporting Inter for my life at that time. Well I already support Inter before, but since I was still kid I'm mostly just enjoying football casually as a hobby back then. And that lost change everything so I guess it could be some blessing in disguise.

Anyway, congrats for the milestone. Keep calm &amp; Forza Inter!

While juventus make a push for the tie, nagatomo has the ball near juventus box and gives a magnificent pass ( while 4 rube players where near him) to palacio who makes it 1-3 which was and the final score to a great game.

"My favorite inter moment ever was the 2010 semifinal against barca. Beating the best team in europe at that time was insane to me. Its when I understood that we could actually win ucl. I remember my milanisti friends saying that we were already eliminated, and after that game they didn't say a word. Also my cousins are barca fans so it gave ne bragging rights for a bit. I loved that 3-1 at San siro. Its my greatest inter memory. 

Then of course I can't forget the final. Finishing an awesome final in the best way possible. What a year that was. 

If we're talking about more recent times it has to be vecinos goal at the olimpico. One of my closest friends is an avid lazio fan and it would have been unbearable to see him after that game. Thank god we won. Even the game against spurs was legendary. I was in San siro and after the vecino goal I was going nuts.

"Seven consecutive wins let's GOOOOO! Handa has had one Godlike game with Napoli, and for the rest of the season he's decided he'll help making matches more interesting. What the hell, come on.

SKRINIAR SCORED A HEADER I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM. Deserved Christmas gift for all the work he's been putting in. Not to mention De Vrij and BASTONI (everyone talking about De Ligt, and yet today Bastoni saved us from the exact scenario where yesterday De Ligt let Fiorentina score their first goal. He's the real youngster MVP)

Also, Hakimi... Wow. You leave him some space, and EVEN at the END of the match he makes runs. Shame he didn't get that second assist of the night or a goal, but I appreciate the effort. Lukaku has been a bit hit or miss the whole night, but the fact that he did what he did for the last 10 minutes or so makes it obvious that he's still working his ass off.

Great Lautaro too. Whether he scored or not, he's been very important, fighting constantly lately.

Not a shockingly good performance, but definitely a better one than the few latest ones. We're going into the Christmas break in the best possible condition.

"Conte‚Äôs style is the high press. This requires the whole defensive line to be pushed as forward as possible. As a result, the midfielders in the system are required to have 3 major attributes, regardless of their individual talents:

1) Conte‚Äôs CMs need to be able to help defend against quick counter attack from the low-blocked opponents. This requires more stamina as they would be expected to run back from opponents box all the way back to ours on a regular basis.

2) At least 2 of the 3 CMs need to be able to switch positions with the defenders in role and/or positions without too much discomfort. Think Brozo and how he always slots into the back whenever De Vrij moves out and wide. Even when you roll back 10 years, Cambiasso functioned like that often because of the attacking license Maicon was given.

3) On the attack, Conte‚Äôs CMs need to be effective in tight spaces; they are also expected to create their own space through movement. Because of the high press, everything on the opponents end is compressed. 

Eriksen does not have any of these attributes. He is attack minded and depend on a DM for defensive support as well as to create space. Someone like Dier at spurs was a classic DM that covered Eriksen whenever he drifted off to create his own space between the lines. 

Conte has a very rigid system that does not accommodate individual movements outside of the high press. On the plus side, he can make shitty players function a lot more effectively; but on the negative, all the individual brilliance is snuffed out. You can forget about players like Eriksen to make impact.

For the record, I rate Eriksen highly and dislike Conte‚Äôs style; but as an Inter fan, I think we have to stick with Conte‚Äôs system because we are already so invested in him.",ggtqxbj,kixjik,FCInterMilan,2020-12-24 03:41:35,collected_company,6

"I know that the stats are not in favor of my opinion, but yet another game where Lukaku contributed absolutely nothing - both offensively and defensively. If somebody had to be subbed it was him and not Lautaro. Or at least play Pinamonti. The tactical decision to bring Hakimi was not that bad to be honest, but Conte overestimated the ability of the remaining players to bring the ball forward, which leads to my next point.

People here stating that after Insigne's red card the team stopped playing. I think it just coincided with Brozovic's injury. Apart from Vidal, there is no alternative to his role. I feel that Gattuso exposed that brilliantly (bringing in Politano for Bakayoko).  The team cannot string more than 3 passes together without him. Especially when Barella is gased out.   


Another thing. Our defending on the left side is atrocious. I am not sure where the problem lies, but from my point of view there is absolutely no chemistry between Gagliardini, Young and Bastoni (individually he is great, I am referring to the three of them as a defensive unit).  


Overall, in all aspects the team was really passive and static and except for Barella, I don't see how fatigue  may be used as an excuse. I think it is more of a psychological issue. Clearly an undeserved victory, but good luck for once in our favor.",gg2t6l3,keip82,FCInterMilan,2020-12-17 06:17:20,dcroopev,13

"Two wins in a row... both by luck in episodes. Though this one far outweighs the one at Cagliari where we at least dominated the first half.

Once again, extremely poor game read by Conte. Not only he prepared the game completely wrong, he also couldn't find a way to adjust.

Furthermore, when he had the immense luck of penalty when we weren't doing anything, an episode topped off by a ridiculous red card (the ref deserves a Tom Cruise-style yell ASAP), he takes off a striker. Later on, he adds a defender.

Oh, please, don't be blinded by Sensi's shot casually causing the penalty. Once again, the small guy provided a performance so poor it could be on the poster of a Unicef campaign. Once again proving the Gobbo turns away if something proves him wrong, making him extremely dangerous. Putting Eriksen in once you realized how much space you had with counter-attacks after the penalty wasn't an option, it was a must.

Everyone says we should just be happy for the win... I prefer to be pessimistic then eventually surprised, rather than be happy and then be completely disappointed. Because that's where our road will lead us to. We are just in luck Juve has Pirlo instead of a real coach.

But we already lost all the money the team could make this season, can't get any worse.",gg2srwe,keip82,FCInterMilan,2020-12-17 06:13:58,StoneCutter46,-1

Handa, I've been insulting you after almost every match. And rightfully so, I still think. But God am I THANKFUL you played the way you did today. THANK YOU for bailing us out.

These 3 points are GOLDEN: Milan still has Atalanta and Lazio. We don't. These 3 points put us even closer to the top than just 2 points, they're much, much more important than they seem.

Eriksen had a good game, shame that Lukaku and Bastoni didn't score from his assists. 

What he did wrong is the fact that he lost the ball prior to conceding the goal. 

Also, we have to search for a new first goalkeeper. I'd keep Handa if we can and he is willing as a second GK, like Cesar and Toldo were helping each other long time ago.

Bastoni for Lautaro + shifting away from the 3-5-2. 
I hope our board of directors and coaching staff alike took notice of Cragno‚Äôs performance. 26 years old, he looks to have a bright future ahead. Could be a good candidate to eventually replace the aging Handano. 

Another subpar performance from Eriksen, that doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit. Not even worth getting into, hopefully we can find a decent buyer for him in January.

"How crazy is it that if Hakimi hadn't gotten injured we wouldn't have seen Danilo come on. Also, while I think the setup was good, the team seemed sluggish and demotivated to me, especially after half time. I think we can mount a title challenge if the mentality is right. Also, Eriksen keeps showing he has quality but I think as long as Conte is coach we should try trade him for someone more useful to him. I really like Locatelli personally. If we can also get Alonso on loan this winter then I will feel this team will really be complete.",gfp11dv,kcarsm,FCInterMilan,2020-12-13 21:52:31,Alarming_Play,10

"Im going to get flamed and downvoted to oblivion but i am happy with the game and the result but unhappy with the whole situation.

The negativity around here is unreal. We should have been 3 or 4 -1 up at half time but that was just ignored in favour of 'statue Handa' and 'get conte out'.

People complain Conte doesn't play Eriksen for more than 5 minutes, he starts him today. People complain he doesn't make subs until too late, he makes 3 before 60 minutes today and yet still complaint/complaint/complaint in the sub when we had been dominating but happened to be losing.

And not even from that good of a position.

One complaint I have aside from the keeper is how we COULD have done better in our shots, but even then... It's more of their keeper doing well rather than our attack doing badly. I've been quite ok with Eriksen today, he hasn't been like, world class, but he's definitely been doing well enough.

"We need to be more rational to judge. It's not purely Conte's fault nor the players fault either. As for Conte, of course we expect more from him. We paid him a lot, it's already our 2nd season and we need improvement. But so far it's more to a decline so it's normal for any fans to be disappointed. He should do better with his tactics, decision, substitution, motivate the team, etc. (anything coach should do) otherwise his project will be questioned. But we also need to remember that he can't do anyting on the pitch (other than coaching part), he can't make player to score, to not missed chances, etc. It should be players job, so you have point there.

Basically everyone shared the blame, they have their own responsibility and we need to work as a team. Yeah I know it's prob a cliche, but it's silly to put the blame toward only 1 specific factor (whoever it is) and think the problem will be solved with that.",gf8k0k0,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 10:32:58,kuruta_tribe,10
"Personally I thought the subs were a bit late.  Why couldn't we play Eriksen around 70\~75?  It was the usual 82\~85'er.

Also, I didn't get the point of Bastoni - D'Ambrosio sub.  If anything, we should've played Kolarov for the last-minute free-kick threat, along with more offensive weapon in his arsenal.

I also would've left Lautaro in the game and subbed someone else off.",gf8fnqr,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 09:53:04,Marseille074,16
"I was thinking the same thing at many points throughout the game. But ultimately there are things you can change and some you can't. You can't change the raw quality of the players at this point in their careers ‚Äì they are what they are. They can control how much effort they put in, how much they run, how well they train and follow the coach's instructions ‚Äì and I think in those terms they actually do very well. I can't blame the players for low effort (not today at least). 

But the coach is a different story. It is totally within Conte's control how to use subs for example. He has 5 of them, he decides to use 3 in the last 5 minutes. That's a deliberate choice, just like the rest of them. That's why we blame the coach.",gf8oshj,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 11:18:23,PastaMastah,8
"You make it seem like the chances created were easy tap in chances. We had no game plan and literally all we did was crossing the ball and sending long balls; we looked much more alive when eriksen came in in like what? 85th min?

This fraud gets paid 12m because of marotta and the fact that zhang is a clueless kid when it comes to football.

"For me personally Conte is the one, who must see that those player, who played 80min and couldn't score a single goal, should be substituted. Conte made his subs at 80min - is this normal? Whole game you opponent is playing for X, you know you should have score a goal, but you still keep your tactics to be as you play also for –•. OK he changed Gaglia for Sanchez - but can someone remember even one game where Lautaro,Sanchez and Lukaku together made something memorable ? Erikssen was subs in 85min, and how we expect to he to playes good for us and to be part of the team, when from 1st of November he hasn't played more then 10min is any game ? 

Anyway, my point is that you cannot expect to win against opponent, who defend whole game, when you use your regular 3-5-2 and do not try to change something till 80m",gf96pht,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 14:42:49,nerrazuri1908,5

"Conte royaly screwed up.

Mistake 1: starting Lautaro. Lautaro has been in poor form lately and is short of confidence and it showed in front of goal. He missed a sitter in the first 10 minutes (hitting the crossbar from there is not an accomplishment) and missed the target from inside the penalty area on at least three occasions. A perfect example is when Lukaku gave him an easy lob and he just froze. Didn't shoot, didn't take it down. Didn't pass. He froze. Lautaro had no business starting this game and it showed. 

Mistake 2: Barella should not have started. I love him, but he was clearly not fit. He started brightly but quickly faded due to a nagging injury. Again, Eriksson is on the bench. 

Mistake 3: subs were way too late. What we were doing in the first half was clearly not working. Instead of making any changes, he kept doing the same thing for an additional 18 minutes before making his first sub in the 68th. And it was an almost like for like change although slightly more positive (perisic in, Young out). Next sub was not until 75 and then no more subs until 85th. Why did he wait so long. Why not make the 85th minute changes earlier? Clearly it wasn't working. 

Mistake 4: The subs he made were baffling. As mentioned above, the first sub was like for like. If what you have been doing was not working, why continue doing it. The second sub (Sanchez for Gaglia) I believe was the smart choice but as I said above should have been earlier. Then came the 85th minute subs. When we are supposed to be crashing the gates. He took out Bastoni for Dambrosio. Why? Bastoni is excellent on the ball and, at 190cm, a clear threat in the air. He put in 3 excellent crosses and could have continued so why take him off and leave Skrinjar (a player who did nothing on the ball all game) on. Then, he took out Martinez for Erikson. As I said above, Martinez should not have started, but once we were in this situation, in the 85th minute, why take out a striker? It was clear that Shaktar was not going to attack and even if they did, we had to take the chance. Why not take out a centre back? (Some might think I'm crazy but others will remember that against Dynamo, in a worse situation, we ended the game with 1 defender on the field and that was the ball playing Lucio). 

Mistake 5: 352. Now I'm not entirely against the formation. It could work. But Conte's complete unbreakable bond to this formation makes it so easy for the opposition to prepare. They know exactly what the formation will be and who the starting 11 will be. They will set up to push us wide and force crosses (like Shaktar and Gladbach), or, if they want to attack, use their Fullbacks to consistently switch play (like Madrid did)

TLDR: Conte name numerous mistakes in this game that ended up costing us dearly.",gf968ni,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 14:36:20,beastmaster11,16
"Conte is a pretty unlikeable guy, and a former rival, that's a big reason why he gets all the blame. But you're right, we started this game well thanks to him and then a crossbar and few missed chances later and we crumbled like we always do. The players are to blame as well. It'd be suicide to sack him now anyways",gf8cief,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 09:23:57,nothappyaboutit,12
"It's incredible to me just how many excuses people will make for this guy. Like I've said before, I could sort of understand it if it was a club legend, but this fucking Rubentino cunt breaks negative record after negative record and it's never ever his fault. If he starts crying about the rain the same people that shat on Mazzarri will be there with a handkerchief to say he's right.

"Of course it's not up to the players - their job is to listen to the coach and play as he commands. As we saw in a lot of previous games, when we are in a desperate situation, and when we put his tactics aside we score goals and play way better (examples Fiorentina, Torino etc.). While we are stuck in his micromanaged tactics, where everyone must do exactly what he is telling them to do - we are SHIT. 

And what chances are you talking about? We had NO chances created with our game plan, not a single one for 97 minutes, all of them were after crosses and long balls. Anyone can play like that, there's nothing new and complicated about it. Problem with this approach is that sometimes you score, and sometimes not, that's simply a nature of a ""pinballish"" game plan like that. It's precisely the reason that's the game plan of lower leagues teams.

One more thing is his fault - when you know you MUST win the game and you are a bigger club out of the two, you must start with more offensive team then you usually start, to establish your dominance and to show your rival who is who. Conte started with his usual team, usual formation and usual attitude in the game that is all but usual and he kept it like that until 75' - solely his fault.",gf9fily,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 17:00:09,riquelm,6

"OMG thank you for saying this, its the exact same thing I've been saying and thinking even before today's shit show. We had 20 shots with 4 on goal and couldn't score at least one goal against a 19yo kid. This isn't the first game where we have issues putting the ball into the net on such easy goals. That is not Conte's fault, that is the fault of the players. 

Tactics I think were good today just like many other games, we created plenty of chances. We just couldn't finish. I guess the only think you could blame him for is always with the late subs. I'm 50/50 on the whole late sub thing because if you got a good rhythm going do you want to possibly mess up the rhythm by taking a player off and putting someone on who could disrupt the play of game? But then again I'm not a coach.

This game I blame the players first.",gf8ncrt,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 11:04:26,randommike12,1
"We need playmakers. We simply do not have any and haven‚Äôt for ten years. All we did all night was throw long balls and crosses into the box.

LWB we‚Äôre getting nothing from and Hakimi isn‚Äôt capable yet of creating for others consistently. As for the strikers, both are your typical number nine who need to be fed, not feed others. Lautaro may look like a SS in stature but he isn‚Äôt a Dybala/Totti/Rooney type of player. He doesn‚Äôt have the vision or passing to play that role. Might be an unpopular opinion but we need to sell him in the summer and spend on an AM. Even if it‚Äôs someone like De Paul who maybe isn‚Äôt the flashiest name but could do the job.

"Absolutely true. The other post on this sub is titled like ""Inter takes last spot for the first time thanks to Antonio Conte"", which is incorrect. Inter takes last spot thanks to Inter, which is a group of people. Conte didn't go on the field and miss chances. The players didn't decide to royally fuck up the subs. It's a group of individuals, each with their merits and faults.

Today it's fair to say that Conte did have like, 70% of the blame - Shakthar played exactly like they did our first match, and we almost tried playing the same way, it's obvious we'd struggle to score. Our tactics were alright, but not nearly good enough to beat Shakhtar. But at the same time it's infuriating how it's been 10 years that it's ALWAYS the coach's fault, ALWAYS, while the players are always in the right. Surely it's not Conte's fault if Young decided to shit himself today and couldn't bring the ball forward even once, right? Surely it's not Conte's fault that made Brozovic play the opposite way he did with Bologna, right?

Conte has many, MANY faults, and it HAS been getting past the point where we can be ""Hey, wake up and fix them"". We're past the point where we should be waiting for everything to click. But many fans (here, on Twitter, on YouTube...) need to understand that this isn't a ""it's either Conte's fault or the player's"". A team is comprised of a large set of gears, each of which needs to be oiled well to function. If a whole bunch of these gears get a bit rusty, you won't solve every problem by replacing one. You need to fix the whole system. And right now... Well, I think it's absolutely incorrect to say it's ALL Conte's fault. Just like it's dumb to say he's been doing well and that he hasn't royally fucked up many, MANY times.

Then again... He still is replaceable, and there will be one point - if he keeps making mistakes as he has been - where he will and should be sacked. Just don't expect everything to suddenly work out when doing so, because as long as we show up in important matches with this shit mentality, we'll be going nowhere.9",gf8n2ym,ka55qn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-10 11:01:49,5kyLegend,0

Conte needs to go. I'm gonna as far as to say that even paying him the 18+ mil thats left of his contract should be given to him. It will be sad to see Eriksen leaving the club while Conte is still managing the team. There's no excuses as to why he shouldn't play him and it doesn't take a football tactician genius to figure that out.

I am convinced that we are indeed wasting our best years with Conte and it pains me to say it because I've had such high hopes for this team, what happened tonight and overall in this group stage should be grounds to sacking him no question about it, what a shit coach man, I used to call anyone who wanted Conte out disconnected from reality because I thought him going would damage the club financially and results wise but the damage he conflicted thus far is worse, I don't give a fuck about the financial situation and how we can't sack him anymore because you should know how much damage this UCL exit does to the club in every aspect, we are gonna lose UCL money and listen to this, this shit hurts our UEFA coefficient points and damages also next season because we are gonna be pot 4 next season which means 99% probability of getting drawn in a group of death and getting knocked out. But hey highly doubt they are gonna sack him because they didn't do it when he took a shit all over them in the summer, highly doubt they are gonna do it now, it's just a shame that this is happening and the humiliation being inflicted on our beloved club.

Let me put it this way, we got **6 points** from 6 games. This wasn't some super hard group of death, it has decent teams but manageable.

3 years in a row we gone out of the group stage and this year not even EL. Some people will try to spin this as a benefit
&gt; It is better this way we can concentrate in the league

They have no sense of what it means to have a pedigree. We can't expect to consider ourselves a big club and attract players if this is what we do now.

We have definitely regressed from last year, this year it feels like a drag watching a game. 

There is literally no creativity in the midfield, Gag and Brozo don't add anything to attack and we have been running Barella into the ground. He makes a midfield change 75 minutes, we have been passing the ball side ways.

"It pisses me off to no end that, every time this club has had a good bit of fortune under Conte, he feels the need to throw some kind of grenade into the works. Maybe this one is smaller than some of the other ones, but sending on Eriksen in a situation where everybody and their mother knew it was a vindictive and insulting substitution was completely unnecessary and only served to leave us with a sour taste in our mouths after what had, ultimately, been an important victory in a fixture that has been a sore spot in recent years.

I hope a loan deal can be worked out in January. I don't want to cut ties with Eriksen once and for all until we know if Conte is back next season. If he leaves, we owe Eriksen a legitimate first chance under a new manager, if he wants it. I understand that maybe some things he could've done better himself, but, ultimately, this all feels like a situation where Eriksen was a player Conte never really wanted but Marotta saw a bargain value on, acquired him, and has ended up being caught in the middle of a pissing match between Marotta and Conte ever since. Basically wasted an entire year of his prime under Conte. He's been paid well, but that's small consolation to a competitor. He wants to play, and Conte has no interest in doing so unless it's in a way that he can make as demeaning and insulting as he possibly can.",gervqjz,k7gncn,FCInterMilan,2020-12-06 11:44:22,Alexander_Roberts,7

"Opened this thread expecting to see praise for the team, Hakimi, Brozo, Lukaku... Meanwhile at least half the comments are about Eriksen. So, so, so tired of this.

He doesn't fit and we play way better without him. What do you guys want? We've stuttered for months trying to play with a system that would fit him and he still never performed. I can't figure out why so many people here care so much about this guy.

Anyways, since I'm now contributing to the problem I just want to say I am so happy to have Brozo back. As crucial as ever.",gerbkwy,k7gcxu,FCInterMilan,2020-12-06 08:54:18,nothappyaboutit,12

"At this point I'm *seriously* starting to wonder whether there's some clause in Eriksen's contract that says he must play at least x times, otherwise he can just rescind his contract. I know Conte is, well, Conte, but that sub really just felt like an unneeded dick move, I honestly don't think even Conte would care about humiliating a player that way.

But hey, that aside (since I'm way too tired of all this Eriksen talk that's plagued us ever since he joined, feels like we're back to Icardi drama or something), let's instead talk about what really matters: our performance! I love that we're back to the usual 3-5-2 without any weird experiments. BIG highlights, to me, were:

* Skriniar. He's not just back to being the way he was with Spalletti, but he also seems to be much more energetic when it comes to attacking. Everyone said ""he can't attack, just let him defend"" last year, and yet look what a BEAST he was at building up play: many times he took Hakimi's spot on the right to let him help out in Bologna's box. Daily reminder (since I still read bs about this) that he said Conte asked him to stay during the latest transfer window: boy am I glad he did. THIS is the Skriniar I know and love!

* Brozo: he can be really shit when he's not feeling good, but when his head is in the game... He completely changes our game. We were so much better offensively, AND he also recovered so many important balls... I just wish he'd always play like this, he was amazing.

* Hakimi: to everyone who criticized him, remember that he's very young, he's in a very different team with different teammates, a different coach, different tactics in a different league. He has to get used to them, and his teammates have to get used to him. Look what happens the moment you start trying to take advantage of his speed. I hope his performance today helps him build confidence!

* Lukaku: I won't write anything for him lol (his goals speak volumes already), please just learn to score when you're alone against the keeper. Aside from that, he ALWAYS scores. So good.

More highlights here and there, but today was a rather satisfying win. Let's keep the right mindset for Shakhtar and AT LEAST get our 3 points, whether we qualify or not! Forza Inter!",geqtzmx,k7gcxu,FCInterMilan,2020-12-06 06:35:20,5kyLegend,14

"Not an Inter supporter, though I respect and enjoy watching what you all are doing over there, but I had to drop by this match thread to say that its a crime that Lukaku isn't being mentioned more in here. Every SINGLE touch the man made was immaculate, his one touch layoffs and holdup play were unbelievable, godly, I can't come up with enough superlatives to describe how he played. It was a joy to watch and as someone who has followed his career for a while its so nice to see him blossoming at a great club like Inter and doing all the things he's capable of. The way he used the ball in this match was absolutely beautiful",gechyu2,k4v36r,FCInterMilan,2020-12-02 15:07:06,awildparteyappeared,2

"Sanchez did just play well against Milan, but Roma would be the ones losing a lot in this trade, not us - especially considering many, many other rather bad performances Sanchez has had. Dzeko would be the Lukaku replacement we're desperate for, and he'd fit our system way, way more. Would be a shame since Sanchez has seemed like a pretty integral part of the group, but it's also a deal that would be beneficial to us.

All in all, I don't think the deal will actually happen, but ""the worst deal in the history of deals""? Maybe for Roma, but not us ahahah",gl3c7u6,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 22:28:48,5kyLegend,47
For Rome,gl3dsc5,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 22:36:50,Rava23,29
I would drive Sanchez to Rome myself. He wouldnt have any problem fitting in my Yaris,gl451r1,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-29 00:51:11,arcuri_l,33
Honestly it would be a decent swap for us. Not great because Dzeko is getting really old but we need him more short-term,gl3lhe0,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 23:12:52,Masca77,5
"Dzeko used to play switching position with the left side of the attack with Roma couples of year ago, I don't remember who was the coach but I think it was Spalletti.
He would be a stunning third attacker to have: he can play with Lautaro instead of Lukaku and even play with Lukaku instead of Lautaro ( maybe) .
I love Sanchez, he is a beautiful player but he is very injury prone and he is really having difficulty in scoring a goal for us. Maybe it's a good deal. 
Tbf I don't think we should give Dzeko 7 millions as he gets from Rome I really don't think this is healthy for club finances, even replacing the 7.5kk of Sanchez salary.",gl3qix0,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 23:36:22,Doctor-Orion,6
"I don't know, I think that Dzeko would work better for us as a backup for Lukaku. Sanchez is showing that he cares and puts a lot of effort but unfortunately he's a bit messy. I don't know what's happening to him, it's a bit sad to be honest.",gl3ch3n,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 22:30:06,Aram_theHead,18
"It's a good deal for us if it's for six months only, other than that Dzeko only has a year or two of career left. He would help us since he can play both with lukaku or lautaro. Just immagine a game where at the 80th we need to score and have lautaro lukaku and dzeko instead of sanchez. Sanchez is a good assistman but not a striker anymore, he's lost confidence with the goal and we don't have the time to wait for him.",gl3rauo,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-28 23:40:11,e1-c,5

"One question, is this going to be like swap loan until the end of the season, bcs in that case this can be a good trade. We get a striker that can be Lukaku's back up, even play with Lukaku, or even play 3 attackers. But if it is forever, than it's a bad trade, Dzeko is almost 35 and can play max 1 season, Sanchez is much better option in that case.",gl4kfdn,l6xsf9,FCInterMilan,2021-01-29 02:27:19,bogdanandjelkovic,3

"Will get downvoted, but this should be a good reminder for th people getting overexcited after our Juve win with ""we're the best"" or ""Conte is the best"" or ""Vidal is the warrior"" slogans ignoring the fuckloads of dreadful matches and generally poorly played season. We have a great roster and obviously if we miss so many chances is due to Conte's overall messy strategies relying purely on pace and fast counters with Lukaku as a main actor. It can work sometimes but most of the time it fails badly or we're just too dependent on episodes. Might win this scudetto because Juve is crap, Napoli and Atalanta are not doing great, and the only contender is a short bench Milan.

"
This was the most agonizing match to watch in the last couple years. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out why, as we‚Äôve had worse results and we did get a point from this match. The pain I‚Äôm feeling is because we came off a stupendous win where everyone performed well and we beat a serious opponent. To go from that, to a performance where everyone looked off and we looked stuck in the mud against a poor team was miserable. 

Champions cannot be this inconsistent. Milan gave us the opportunity to seize the winter title but alas we couldn‚Äôt. I finally thought we got over the mental barriers, but today was evidence that we have far to go before we hoist the Scudetto. 

Our hero Lukaku looked disinterested and whiny, Latauro was dreadful, and Hakimi was playing like a beaten dog afraid of making a mistake. I love this team and players, but this is unacceptable if we want to talk about winning the league this year.

"I'm glad that we don't win that winter Scudetto or whatever, seems like always gave us the bad luck for the rest of the season

This is obviously an off day for the team, any team in the world will get this day, i just hope that we don't get it too often for the rest of the fixtures

Lautaro need to find his form again, this player too inconsistent to be more than a mediocre striker. Lukaku got pocketed by Udinese physically strong defender also predictable. Biggest disappointment for me from this match is Hakimi, his decision making really odd today, i know that he's not Maicon but I wish he'd be more decisive.

I cannot blame Conte too much, he already warned us in press conference that it will be hell to break this strong Udinese defence, their morale also boosted after the draw against Atalanta. Tactically Conte is too rigid, but his subs actually being decent than previous matches.

I'm still cautious about our Scudetto ambition, it's going to be riot that not even Milan but also Atalanta, Roma, Napoli and Juve still in contention. Not ideal that we couldn't holding hands together with Milan on top this week, but a point gained is a point gained.

19 more games after this, i hope the team bounce back and prove to us that the superb win against Jube aren't the only thing to remember from this season. A Coppa win against Bilan this midweek should be a damn fine rebound",gkffff6,l3hx08,FCInterMilan,2021-01-24 03:12:28,Rezorblade,13

Nothing you under the sun. We struggle against physically strong defensive teams. Today all our attacking players were poor in a way or another. Probably Lukaku's worst performance of the season.,gkfdyk5,l3hx08,FCInterMilan,2021-01-24 03:05:35,Masca77,3
"This is what people mean when people say Conte does not have any other plan. 

The team really struggled from 1st minute, we did not come close at scoring. So what does he do? He sticks to it for 70 minutes. There was a moment I wondered if Vidal has touched the ball other than running around.

Lukaku didn't get service, Lautaro as much as I love him has regressed this season and been bad. Hakimi had a stinker, killed some good moments. I don't even get the purpose of Young. Perisic can't even get passed his man or stop over hitting crosses.

Just general horrible display and he makes changes when 70 minutes have gone with no improvement since half time.

We really do not deserve to be 1st or win the league based on the performance so far this season.

I really really really do not enjoy watching us this season. Actually depressing that I missed some games on purpose.

This was the moment to make up grounds. It has happened time and time again.

I don‚Äôt recall any instance where we managed to unlock such situations where the opponent is barking the bus. We always look like we don‚Äôt want to score more than they don‚Äôt want to concede. Again we fail to capitalize on Milan loss.

"The subs couldn't make any difference this time even if brought on earlier. Sensi is terrified of getting injured, Perisic and Sanchez are past it and at the end of the day, Udinese parked the bus perfectly, credit where it's due. We don't play against ghosts. The opponents sometimes have a say.

Secondly, Lautaro missed another sitter and it's clear that he is overrated and overpriced, we should get rid of him if we are offered a decent amount of money. Lukaku is the only striker able to put the ball in the net. Sanchez and Lautaro can not and every goal they score till the end of this season will be a bonus.

Hakimi was bad today, but it's also our fault that we insisted to attack almost 90 minutes with our right flank, I know Young is not great this season but at least we could try for a change to surprise them, Udinese players focused on Lukaku and Hakimi and handled them relatively well.

Lukaku was simply invisible, the midfielders couldn't unlock Udinese's defense, our subs were useless as mentioned.

For what it's worth, our defense was good but there wasn't too much to defend in the first place. 0-0 was a fair result, we failed to win games with far more chances created than this.",gkfk5ll,l3en8i,FCInterMilan,2021-01-24 03:34:29,QuintanaBowler,1

"Greece. 2011 as an outsider who didn't watch football , end of 2017 season as slowly becoming a true fan.

I had Fifa 09 and the colour together with Ibrahimovic, maicon, zanetti and cambiasso was fun to use. No i didn't know anything about the triplete. I just liked the colour and the strong players. After that i had no real interest in football until i found friends who do not support greek teams (except in europe. Cuz it would be funny for an olympiakos to win the europa league. Althought it won't happen.) Also they were playing fifa 17. One is Barcelona and the other is Manchester united. So i decided ""hey this looks fun. Maybe I'll start supporting a team too."" Then i remember ""ah yes. Inter. It was fun on fifa 09. I'm looking forward to use their world class players"".


Little did i know we finished 7th in 16-17.

I kinda felt sad about the team.I mean 4,5 stars?! Come on we are better than this. 
So i searched everything about it's story, from the start of the club inside that one restaurant, to mr meazza himself, to Herrera's la grande inter, to the german trio and the spiderman, to the triplete and then... Oh boy. The banter era.

So I became more curious about the banter era and decided to watch a match that was coinsidentaly the first match of the 2017-18 season (my actual first season of watching football and coincidentally skriniar's first inter season).

After that i watched another. And then another. And so i was hooked.

I fell in love with the club. I loved their history. I loved the colours. I loved the legends. And i did not mind at all that the team fell from grace. (Cuz usually people in my country support big teams that win often like barca, real, Bayern and my best friend who is Juventus.)

Falling from grace is all the more interesting to me cuz i want them back up there. Winning the league. Playing against the big clubs.

Winning the champions league. I want to see that.

So for 4 years i celebrated, got disappointed, got angry, got sad, and got some minor heart attacks watching this team.

Yeah, my journey with this team isn't long. Only 4 years,

Yeah, my fontest memories are 
3-2 lazio to get back to champion's league after 8 years,
 the first match against Tottenham 2-1 which it felt like we were announcing the world that we are back.(also oh boy the crowd shouting ""THE CHAMPIOOOOONS"". That. Was cool.)
And the first win I've seen against juventus thst was some days ago.

And yeah, the only BIG disappointment for me was the Europa league final until now,

But yeah. I'm an Inter Fan. And I'm proud about it.",gk1or4s,l1uc69,FCInterMilan,2021-01-21 17:46:45,philipagg,19

From then on, children's fascination turns into a real interest in football. Especially in Ronaldo's accomplishments. However, when him moved to Real, I did not follow him with my sympathies. I stayed with Inter. This is because with age I stopped dreaming of being a forward and started playing as a defender instead. It was for this reason that I started looking at Javier Zanetti, the best footballer I have ever seen.

"I was born in Rome and my father was and still is a huge Roma fan. So he obviously made me watch it all the time when I was a little kid. But I never liked it. Never liked the colours, the players (Totti above everyone), the president, the supporters, everything. So one day I think I said to him and my mom something like ""I don't like watching Roma, I want to watch another team"".

It was pretty huge to my father, he took it like some kind of personal offense. But anyway, I started watching other teams, bouncing from one to another. One day it was Lazio, another day Parma, or Sampdoria, and so on for some months. 

Then I bumped into an Inter match in 1997. There was this new bald Brazilian guy who seemed pretty cool and talented. I instantly fell in love with him, watching him run around the pitch and making defenders crazy. So I started watching Inter, and everything else was cool to me: beautiful colours, a crazy team that could beat the strongest team and then lose to Bari the next week, a passionate president. And my biggest love in all sports, our forever captain Javier.

"Take aways for me

1)We have two golden boys in Barella and Bastoni. We must keep them for the long term at all costs. 

2)Vidal can show up during big games. 

3)Ronald was LIVID because he barely had any half chances at goal. Skriniar, De Vrij, and Bastoni is one of best defenses in Europe. 


4)We need a left sided player that can match Hakimi‚Äôs energy and work rate that he shows on the right. Once we have that, we will be a true force. Theo Hernandez anyone?",gjnhrmb,kzfr2p,FCInterMilan,2021-01-18 05:44:13,Jalapinho,25

Vidal showed up big time and didn‚Äôt do anything stupid. Brozo was flawless today. I am out of adjectives for Barella. MOTM. Solid show from young. Hakimi ran circles around everyone on the right flank. Lukaku, man! His hold up play is unmatched, led to many chances. Lauti was good with the link ups but really needs to improve on his finishing. Handa came through with the dive to keep the clean sheet. This is probably the best game we‚Äôve played all season. Played like true champions today. I feel very proud.

"What I learned from this match is that our best midfield is Eriksen, Brozo &amp; Barella.   
Vidal and Sanchez are off form. Maybe bc not playing so much? Sanchez did do better closer to the end of the game. 

I'm still not fan of this playing style/ formation. But it is bringing ok results. 

At the end of the day we have a solid team, but are bit unlucky and need a kick in the arse to start playing.

"Just finished the game. Brutal to watch, but considering a lot of rotation and half-decent opposition, take the win and move on. 

This sub has probably made Eriksen my least favourite player on the squad but my attempt at an unbiased, honest analysis since he's all anyone cares about now: he was somewhere between ok to less than average, but of course it is a new position and he looks very short on confidence. His positioning mostly rendered him useless and you could literally see his teammates choosing not to pass to him, but again, first time there. I do feel bad for him but he was pandering on the ball quite a bit and killed momentum more than once. He still has a dangerous shot which I would've loved to see go in just for the confidence boost, but he really didn't seem to want to try too much. I'm not ruling out a future for him at this position with more time, I just think people need to chill TF out with him. He is not the player he once was but he could potentially still be useful. 5/10",gj5lma9,kwk2fm,FCInterMilan,2021-01-14 05:09:29,nothappyaboutit,0

"Lautaro is so annoying with his missing easy chances. Lukaku,well is Lukaku, at least he scored the winning goal today. Sanchez should not even start until he's able to bang a couple of goals, seems like his confidence is gone; he's been missing way too many easy chances.",gj4szpy,kwk2fm,FCInterMilan,2021-01-14 01:38:24,abook1234321,12
"What's up with people either making Eriksen's performance to a 10/10 masteclass, or a total shitshow, I thought he had a normal game, a rating of 6 nothing special, nothing terrible, he gave away 2 balls that could have resulted in dangerous situations but that can be excused since it's his first time playing there, other than that it was a normal game.

He needs to work harder, he needs to get better, we expect a lot more from him than a 6 rating performance, and Conte needs to keep giving him consistent playing time, because I'll say it again, since we are not gonna buy anyone in his position we absolutely need to work to make him better and he needs to do the same, we can't have someone with his qualities on the bench and start someone like Gaglia or even Vidal (I thought he did good today).

And no I m not on the ""Eriksen can solve all our problems and he's the best playmaker in Europe"" train or whatever but you can't deny that he's a quality player, I actually wanted him replaced in this transfer window by someone who fits but it wasn't possible which leaves us with the only possibility of integrating him in the team, and we should at least try to do it.",gj4s1ka,kwk2fm,FCInterMilan,2021-01-14 01:31:21,Lothar18,15

Far cry from the Icardi days, say what you want about him being a cancer, which he was, but at least the guy buried his chances with no mercy. Loved Eriksen's performance. Was he perfect? Hell no. Did he completely brainfart a couple times? Hell yeah he did. But we won, and it's his first game in that position meaning (hopefully) he'll only learn and grow into it. But to see him move the ball forwards through the middle of the park and at least have some creativity was something this team hasn't had all season. Hakimi played amazing too!",gj4nvas,kwk2fm,FCInterMilan,2021-01-14 01:00:06,Mignelli14,-13
"Can we all agree perisic had a pretty great game? Or we hating on him randomly once again? 
Still poor performance by eriksen, I hope that if we don‚Äôt sell him he can improve in this position, he has the capability to do it and that would free up brozo and solve a lot of problems in the midfield

"My take-always, in no particular order:

1) We may not be as thin defensively as I feared. Kolarov was fairly solid and definitely looked better today than I was expecting, and that‚Äôs with Perisic playing down the left wing. Ranocchia also put in a solid shift and should be fine to play in most league matches against mid/low tier sides. 

2) We really need another attacker in this window. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs someone old and cheap‚Äîwe have to have it. Giroud would have been perfect, but that looks unlikely now. Basically, we need someone who can play like Sanchez did when he first came here. 

3) If Eriksen stays, he can absolutely contribute something positive, even if that‚Äôs a rotational role that he feels he‚Äôs overqualified for. I thought he looked fine playing with Brozo and Barella, and if can play like he did today (a big if), he can probably be an upgrade from Vidal (who is shit).",gj4lz34,kwk2fm,FCInterMilan,2021-01-14 00:45:53,Dgryan87,6

"Not bad so far, especially given we're playing with many non-starters. Skriniar, Ranocchia (kinda), Vidal and Young have been pretty decent today, so I'm happy for them. Perisic and Sanchez have been disappointing me in their usual way (the former tends to always gift the ball to Fiorentina with every cross of his, the latter takes 50 touches to pass the ball to an unmarked teammate 5 meters from him). Eriksen has been meh: as usual some decent passes, but also I remember one really bad first touch that almost made Fiorentina go on a counter and another time that he actually did gift them a counter. He defends alright, but he hasn't been making himself available enough, which is why he hasn't received many passes altogether. Lautaro has been pretty bad today, hopefully in the second half he can turn it around.

Anyway, I'm not too disappointed so far, but let's keep playing in the 2nd Half: it's clear both teams were very low energy (as customary in the Coppa Italia) until our goal. Fiorentina then got angry and started revving up their engines... Which means the second half will be much less calm and more chaotic instead. Let's keep focusing and win this!",gj48iie,kwfyg4,FCInterMilan,2021-01-13 23:00:00,5kyLegend,1
that Skriniar VAR tackle was so satisfying to watch. Perfect timing,gj48ed8,kwfyg4,FCInterMilan,2021-01-13 22:59:04,anakmager,2
"**recapping Eriksen's first half**

the good: 

- forced the first shot on target from deep
- perfect corner kick to Skriniar
- a pass from deep immediately found Lautaro in the box
- a few minutes after the Skriniar VAR thing, he made a quick interception that might've stopped a Fiorentina counterattack
- keeps the defensive shape intact. Good workrate/coverage

the bad:

- horribly misplaced a pass despite being unchallenged and having loads of space. Resulted in a dangerous Fiorentina counterattack 
- generally not making himself available for the pass as much as he needed to. If you notice, Brozovic is always there for the pass when he plays this role

I'm feeling okay so far but let's see how the next half goes. Eriksen definitely deserves not to be subbed of in the hour mark based on his first half performance",gj489tm,kwfyg4,FCInterMilan,2021-01-13 22:57:59,anakmager,7

"Very weird game: 

Why? We had a good rhythm in the first half and we suffered a goal. Second half, the reaction we had was simply incredible and unbelievable. I felt like Conte was a sort of Hannibal (for those who like history), tactically genius. After the second goal we scored, total drop-off, Conte looked like less than an average common general. In the post-game conference he said that he asked the team to press high even after the second goal, but the team did exactly the opposite. Maybe Conte had good intentions, but the mental feedback he sent to the team by sending Kolarov, Perisic and Gagliardini was: ‚Äúdefend‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs stay positive guys, next week vs Juventus in my mind will be symbolic and indicative of what will happen in the latter half of the season,

Also love Lukkaku but I wish he would stop complaining all the time when he doesn‚Äôt get the ball and El Toro needs to shoot in the top corners, i haven‚Äôt done the math but I‚Äôll bet my mint green away kit that he is far more successful when he does that.

"I genuinely believe we will not win Serie A this season. In fact finishing 2nd and winning Coppa would be an achievement IMO.

I know some of you also see this and to others sorry if I sound like a debby downer.

We have clear limitations in this squad and most importantly with Conte and his cowardice style of coaching. We concede way too many goals, we also only seem to react rather than understand how important it is to take a step forward and make sure it is put to bed. 

It is only normal this escape we seem to always do in second half can only last this long.

On top, to have players in the team who only had legs and running but no actually ability with the ball. Conte learned a trick 10 years ago with Vidal and regardless if the man his body gave up he will still play him.

This game was crying out with Sensi or above who can play with the ball. I gave up saying Eriksen as it is clearly not working with him. 

Conte is also a big coward for taking off Hakimi and Lautaro but the biggest insult was when he replaced Vidal for Giagliardini. Roma straight way upped the ante when we made that switch. Brozovic, Barella and Gag were just chasing the ball and behind the ball rather than actually making a play.

Kolarov is another player who is just there to add the numbers. In other leagues, he would be playing for a smaller teams since he lost so much.

As a top team to play this outdated defensive style with no real punch is sad to still witness in top Italian game.

We are in a very difficult spot, financially we are struggling and we are paying for a guy who should be making us top team. Sacking him is going to be painful since we will lose money and we won't be able to attract top coach with the lower salary we will be offering.

It has been great believing Inter was on the up again last season but I also think we have dark period ahead of us.",giri9xy,kuegci,FCInterMilan,2021-01-10 22:13:47,Dusty_philosopher,15

Surely we could have done better, conte could have done better, handa could and lautaro could, but we played a good game against one of the best teams in Italy, especially right now as they are playing really good lately

"We didn't play bad, I've seen worse game won by us at the end of the 90 minutes but this game exposed all the weaknesses of this team:

- mental weakness: You fail to score the penalty^1, the opponent scores a penalty and you have a fucking blackout

- roster weakness: Perisic was abysmal today, Vidal is on Nainggolan levels of fitness and football awareness and Sanchez is really done, bollito they say in Italy, well he is even worse than bollito. 

- goalkeeping weakness^2: we are in desperate need of a new goalkeeper. Keita's shot was a slow and central one, H's reflexes were even slower. We can't always win the games by scoring a minimum of 2 goal every single time. This is impossible, especially for a team like ours that is not that cynical with the chances it has (we are no ""one shot one kill"" team, sadly, as we can see from the 11 shots on target of today). 
Since the beginning of the season we have had 21 goals conceded on 57 shots on goal in 17 games. We had 35 goals conceded the whole last season. 
Not adressing Handanovic steady decline might be the greatest regret of this season

^1 before this one Sanchez had a ratio of 4 penalties scored on a total of 11 penalties...how can it be possible that they let him take the penalty ? This is the real fault of Conte today.

"Not a bad team effort at all, but again Conte confirms his inability to make correct choices mid-game - playing the trequartista was the worst decision he could make because they were clogging that area for the entire second half. Eriksen was somewhat relevant because he has a good foot making him dangerous in inactive plays, but other than that pass to Bastoni he predictably didn't make much in active plays.

Both Chilean should be sent to Colo-Colo because with all due respect that's their level now. They are not Serie A material anymore, at least not for title contenders. They had phenomenal careers but now they are no better than their Sampdoria role counterparts. (I don't know why Sanchez took the penalty, he has a horrible record)

With all that in mind, there's a replay clearly showing the ball hitting Barella's forehead first and then his hand. Sky showed the replay only once, then suddenly disappeared and never to be seen again, furthermore wasn't shown by the VAR room.

No real reason to play Gags today when the man can't kick snow off a rope. Reality is we've lost to a team who actively play Adrien Silva and Maya Yoshida and pay them their wages.

"Vintage january Inter.

It was rather amusing to see fans getting hard-ons for our serie of wins, without looking at the quality of the opponents (and the quality of our matches as well...). Guess what? Samp is middle of the pack and we lose a very important match, Conte can't win an important match to save his life. Nothing new, we're just lucky that the quality of this year's Serie A is ridiculously low.

Inter started to play better when Gagliardini and Sanchez went out. Can't say much about Young/Perisic swap, Ivan is a mysterious object in this squad eve though Young shouldn't be on the field as a starter anymore.

As for the others, can't really find a positive, as usual we started to play ""too little, too late"" which is a kind of habit for this team.",gibbv2g,krqlwu,FCInterMilan,2021-01-07 00:04:59,Sputnikboy,-7

"The same people who piled on Vidal for the dumb penalty last match should be furious with Barella today. What a dogshit penalty to give away.

I don't think I'll be ready to see Sanchez on the field anytime soon. If you want to play well only for your NT, then ask them to pay you, not us. Disgusting performance from him, that's seriously a 2/10 from me.

Had we played like we did in the second half, but for the whole match, we'd have won. Skriniar, De Vrij, (mostly) Bastoni, Hakimi and at times Lautaro are the ones I'll praise today, at least. It's not their fault we lost. But what a disgusting way to break our win streak.

Again: I cannot repeat enough times how much I dislike Sanchez right now. And some people in this sub are somehow going to blame Conte for this one - I already know you ""conteout-ers"" are crawling out of your holes to pin this on him. All I have to say is that it's ridiculous to even think that - especially given what lead to us going 2 goals down.

"For the people saying Conte can't be blamed for this game, I get what you mean but kind of disagree. And it's not because we missed the penalty, it's because we missed the penalty then mentally collapsed after it. Even if we missed it, a team who are ""title favourites"" or ""contenders"" should be dominating possession and coming up with chances. We are literally getting taken to church by a mid-table team. And that's because we have 0 offensive creativity or teamwork or chemistry from the midfield up. This formation might work, but not with the staff we have. If you've watched every Inter game this year, you'll agree. We barely get by in games we've won and that's because one player (usually Rom) comes up with a big goal or a penalty helps us get by. I actually don't remember the last time one of our midfielders scored a goal. This first half is the perfect example that this formation creates nothing so when shit goes wrong we either need to get lucky, or overcome an extremely difficult deficit to win games. Not sustainable for 38 rounds. This awful mentality we suck into after things go wrong is because of the leader. A good coach would show resilience. That being said, there's 45 minutes left and no reason we can't turn it around. So let's stay positive.",gib3mvk,krnert,FCInterMilan,2021-01-06 22:57:42,Mignelli14,0

"After the first half I wanted to cry. But hey, Pazza Inter will always be Pazza. Lautaro started off iffy, but holy shit he grew better and better the entire match. Isn't this his first hattrick? I'm so happy for him, he definitely deserves it since, despite his very rough patches, he's always been working hard for us. Reminder that ""Lautaro is thinking about Barcelona, he's being awful"" while ""Dybala is the new Messi"" based on Italian media, all while Lautaro's stats were better. I'm glad he's been proving himself as a good, capable player.

Let's not talk about Vidal. He's done a few good things, but the bad things he's done completely overshadow them, and rightfully so: today he's had a disaster of a performance. Let's hope Sensi manages to stay healthy.

Lukaku too had a very good match, not even scoring-wise, but finally he's been decisive with his plays protecting the ball. Special mentions to Hakimi, Skriniar and mostly everyone else really.

Also, the one on Skriniar was a penalty and not even a 6-2 scoreline will make me change my opinion on it. Let's hope Lukaku's injury will be a minor one (don't trust GdS's reports yet) and let's keep playing like this.",ghy65o2,kpkivg,FCInterMilan,2021-01-03 21:29:33,5kyLegend,11
"Facts I got from our match: 

* I can never comment on these live threads: whenever I do we suck, as soon as I stopped we scored 4
* Sometimes Hakimi is a bit too eager to go forward, he made a few mistakes he could've avoided if he was more precise
* Young is not reliable anymore 
* Vidal is shit
* Skriniar is slowly going back to his old form
* Sensi is a fucking baller

"Lautaro and especially Lukaku were great, not much to say there, and the midfield worked well for the most part, the problem being individual mistakes.

Hakimi moved very well but was a bit sloppy with his passing imo. 

My only grip this match is with our defense. We really shouldn't be conceding almost every match, especially with the back 3 we are fielding. 

The obvious lowlights are Young and Vidal, but it's promising to see that when both Darmian and Sensi were subbed in in their place they both played well.",ghy5q2t,kpkivg,FCInterMilan,2021-01-03 21:25:44,RaynerOP,9

Personally would love Cunha from H.Berlin. They are doing so bad. So maybe them getting relegated could force a sale.

(We're still paying the price of our banter era with 4,000 points in the 16/17 season and 0 in the 17/18 season. If we keep qualifying for the champions league it should be better in two years. Check the [UEFA ranking](https://it.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/#/yr/2021) )

"Looking at teams like Real or Liverpool which had their own bad eras some years ago I would say that there is really no secret in going to the top - you need steady progress over the years, good transfers (some will flop but overall you need to constantly get the best players you can), hiring different coaches and stable improvements in investment. 


Inter is on a good way to do just that. They've bought some good players over the years, changed coaches replacing mediocre guys with pretty good and then with an expert (de Boer/Pioli to Spaletti to Conte) and the results are there - from getting back to CL, to establishing position in the top of the table to challenging for scudetto. Good sporting director is a big plus too, and while Ausilio did some good job, Marotta is better. 


So all is left is to keep going in the right direction. To sour my comment at the end: unfortunately with current financial problems that bright future is uncertain. If Inter will keep their best players (All 3 CB's, Achraf, Barella, LuLa) and improve on this we should see better CL run as soon as in next season.

In terms of condition: less fuckups, especially more consistency by Handa, Lautaro and Vidal.

In terms of tactics: not my specialty but I think we need to be more adaptable less predictable. Be less dogmatic and bring more variety. We might just not get this with Conte unless he changes completely his mentality.

"The incorporation of Eriksen in the left side of the midfield is crucial. Up until now, the left wing was stagnant since there are no strong candidates holding the left wing back position. Perisic lacks the creative output but very physically capable of penetrating enemy's defensive line. That alone, however, would not work well in delivering quality passes to the enemy's 6 yard box. There was always not enough time for sufficient build ups. Interception and lost balls were far too often, resulting in the loss of momentum. In the end the team relied too heavily on the right wing side manned solidly by Hakimi and Barella. Now, Eriksen provides the playmaking power on the left side of the enemy territory, unlike, for instance, Gagliardini, whose sole quality lies in his defensive attributes. The second goal against Milan would not have happened if it was Gagliardini on the pitch instead of Eriksen.",gog2yyu,lp9015,FCInterMilan,2021-02-23 18:22:04,ultrafas_tidious,7

Long Gone are the years where we have to field players like Eder, Karamoh or Schelotto

Derby Victory is always special, this one even more sweet because of the circumstances. We always dominated recent Derby but it's never this easy, we usually suffers and got conceded too. On reflection, Milan fans bemoaned about Handanovic's saves as if that the only thing that made them lose, completely ignore that we could scores 2-3 more goals on first half if not for Donnarumma blocks or poor finish. After Ibra came out they literally cannot penetrate our defence anymore. How the hell they are being optimistically for the future if their only reliable player is already very very old?

Addressing the game, I thought everyone had a great game, another special mention to Perisic, he did nothing wrong the entire game, Handa was a monster, Eriksen has looked very good in recent games too, and as much as I want to give my MOTM to Perisic, I can't ignore how good Lautaro and Lukaku were, so my MOTM goes to Lautaro.

And finally, this is another game prepared and managed almost perfectly by Conte, as much as I criticized him in the beginning of the season, he deserves all the praise not just in recent games but ever since we got out from the UCL, you can't ask anything more from him (except for me the Roma game), and I m not gonna lie, I lost faith in him in the beginning of the season especially after the UCL exit and I hoped he'd prove me wrong and he did, and I m very happy for this outcome, I m not just saying this now, I wanted to say it for quite some time but this feels like the right moment.",go8m801,lozw1i,FCInterMilan,2021-02-22 00:32:10,Lothar18,26

I didn't like the central part of the game, where we backtracked and let Milan play, our D was a bit suspect but Handa did his job; still, we could have closed this game earlier.

Man of the match? Lautaro would be too easy to say, so I'm going with Perisic. Yes, the same Perisic I critized a lot in the past three years: he worked his ass off, both in the back and more importantly when attacking, he created chances, he tried to score, he gave some GOLDEN assists to the LuLa, only one of which was transformed.

"I'm not going to hold back words, it's a derby with rivalry after all. I'm gonna chat shit, give me your salt.

When we said ""No penal no party"" Milan fans said ""let's wait for the next derby"". 

When we won the last derby in Coppa Italia, Milan fans said ""let's wait for the next derby"". 

Well... we're waiting.

Absolutely destroyed, we've struggled more against relegation sides. Milan embarrassed themselves and got a spanking that was long due. Their good form and penalty run is over and now they've lost their 4th game out of last 7. The early ""Salute la capolista"" from start of January quickly dissolved into ""our goal has always been top 4 anyway"". Inb4 people say ""it was just banter"". Yeah, it always ends up being so in such situations, innit? People acting like Pioli is the next Pep and he'll transform the club. Lmao, enjoy what's coming next. How do we know? Because we've been through the same stint with Pioli, just shorter term. He didn't magically turn into a GOAT after 15 years of mediocrity. Milan fans with the blindfold on will have to admit sooner than later that the 15 penalties in 20 games is what kept them in so far. Even if they're rightly given penalties, it doesn't change the fact that it was their gameplan and main way of securing dubs. Don't @ me, I know I'll get spammed for this paragraph but internally Milan fans are saying the same, just with a different flair. They know they're in shit form and that their earlier good run is ending. 

I loved our players' passion and drive tonight, they played great, they made it our game. Even when we fucked up, Handanoviƒá showed up in absolute prime-time form. I loved our individual performances and as a whole team. I'm loving what Peri≈°iƒá and Eriksen are bringing to our games lately now that Vidal and Young were shifted out due to bad form or injuries.

"I'm very satisfied with our defensive performance, especially from Skriniar, which completely dampened Lazio's attacking threat throughout the game. Seriously, Lazio are a tough side to hold off for 90 minutes. Besides the lucky deflection goal, Lazio seemed genuinely hard-pressed to find good opportunities to exploit. Our defensive pressuring and discipline in our own half was something to behold. 

Lukaku had an amazing response after the last game against Juve. But I was more impressed with Lautaro, who was relentlessly pressuring, making intelligent runs, and really came to form as a second striker - creating chances on the break and providing the goal scoring threat.

"Perfect Match. Lukaku and Lautaro are back with full menace. Lukaku is a monster, he clearly cannot always play like this but when he did, he's the best Serie A Striker

Skriniar is a Wall, a Golem, a Collosal Titan that cannot be beaten. I think this is one of his top performance this season. Whole defensive unit playing good (despite Bastoni sometimes clumsy attempt), whole attacking unit playing good including Eriksen, love to see much from him for the rest of the season

Conte got the tactic right, weird late sub aside he's really outclass the opponent. we don't let them counter attack from minute one, we being patient and almost always unleashed powerful counter attack, with more luck we can scores 1 or 2 more goals

I hope this kind of performance can shut the fuck up people who cry out bottlers at us ( they won't), including ourselves who seems so nervous before the game and there's a thread in this sub where people practically admit that we are chokers while we try our best to remove the stigma

It's very enjoyable game disturbed only by two morons at commentary booth, i hope someone check them up and fairly criticize the way they speak which clearly biased and anti Inter. Even at 90 minutes they still rambling how Lazio were far better and don't deserves to lose (one lucky deflection and they somehow still superior than us in the eyes of the commentators).

Their lone goal came from a wild deflection (so much for luck). Everyone played well, but it was awesome to see Eriksen play well, Barella‚Äôs quality showing through, and the connection LuLa has. 

Brozo and our back line are incredible. Hakimi and Perisic did what was asked.  No complaint from me about them. 

Still a lot of season left, but a win in the derby would be incredible. It feels like this team is hitting its stride and even though we are top, our best hasn‚Äôt been achieved yet. I think we can bring this home this season.",gngxrl1,ljy7jw,FCInterMilan,2021-02-15 05:54:35,TooFewTulips,10

"A GREAT win against the team that currently was in the best form in the whole League. All considering Lazio kept fouling us in the end and the ref pretended that didn't happen. Lukaku FINALLY giving me the sort of showing I want from him (I take credit for his performance today, he definitely read my Reddit comment and played well because of it), but to be honest everyone played well. Yes, Perisic too. And I'm happy to finally see Eriksen play really (emphasis on **really**) well against a STRONG, physical team like Lazio.

But man. My MOTM goes to Skriniar. Holy shit, defenders tend to go unnoticed for MOTM nominations, but today he was ON POINT. Not only did he have a masterful performance, but he picked up the slack when De Vrij had some brainfarts.

I'm really happy about today's performance. And screw everyone who goes to say ""Lazio played better"" just because they had more possession. We neutralized them, only got scored against because of a silly deflection, and we CREATED chances and CAPITALIZED on them.

Really, really about this. Now, onto the derby we go! ***With Bastoni, Brozovic and Barella who didn't get yellows!!!***",gngxkqc,ljy7jw,FCInterMilan,2021-02-15 05:52:55,5kyLegend,32
"Damn I'm happy! We won (and won convincingly), we didn't choke when all our rivals lost, we beat a very tough team and a year later we're again first in the league again! No yellows to the players in danger and we go full force (hopefully) to spank bilan.

Forza Inter!",gngxkh9,ljy7jw,FCInterMilan,2021-02-15 05:52:52,competitiveburping2,9

"We. Didn‚Äôt. Mess. Up. A. Crucial. Game.

Finally, we can scream this out loud. Near-perfect performance by all of the players, congrats to Eriksen for playing _this well_ after a long time. Lukaku MOTM without a doubt. 

I‚Äôm in love with Inter, it‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day. This game will surely be one of the most memorable of the season. CAPOLISTA, and this time we have the chance to knock Bilan down once for all. This smells so fucking Pazza to me.",gngxh9k,ljy7jw,FCInterMilan,2021-02-15 05:52:06,Roaming_Dinosaur,23
"What I loved most about this game was that for once we were fucking playing vertical. Something like conte‚Äôs first games at inter, and this style of play is just perfect for our strikers and this game proved it

A part from that: 8 rating game for lukaku but my motm is skriniar, absolutely perfect on defence and great with the ball as well, finally. Also, I really really liked perisic performace, especially defensively

Only bad note from tonight is hakimi... for what I remember he didn‚Äôt do a single correct thing all game long. Not talking about being dangerous or doing something good, just mistakes all over the place... to me he is getting a 4 tonight, although the team played really well",gngxgfh,ljy7jw,FCInterMilan,2021-02-15 05:51:54,Phil_996,15

I'm also happy to see Eriksen play like this. While he's been a bit shaky defensively, and while he could try and shoot harder, his contributions today have been absolutely fundamental, and this is the first time I've seen him perform on this level for us against a top team. Really happy for him.

If they wanted to change (and imho there was no reason to) they should've gone all the way and do something like Juventus did. This is just a really bad and unprofessional version of our current logo.

From a technical standpoint:

\- The blue is not Inter's blue

\- The weights of the letters and the spacing between the letters are not consistent (look at the top of the M and the serifs)

\- The font is just rofl. Just a few years ago they paid a renowed Milan firm to make them the logo and a custom font and now they get this boring and plain sans serif? Come on!

"I‚Äòm right now not to angry like some other people around here. I also dont think Juve won because of some ref shenanigans or anything. They were smart used our mistakes and defended well. They knew without lukaku upfront we couldn‚Äôt play high. 

I also dont see the mistake for the second goal on Handa. Yes he didnt look good but for me the main reason for the goal was bastoni. Who gave handa a wink ,i got this,. Well he didn‚Äôt. I‚Äòm also fine with bastoni making mistakes hes young he also saved us alot with his mature and calm playstyle sometimes. Its important that he learns from it. 
Young on the other hand... im disappointed in him big time. He wasn‚Äôt anywhere in the first half offensivly on top of that he made this stupid stupid error. For me is that a pen? No, but with the new rules? Yes definitely. He was holding way to long. Its a stupid mistake by someone in his thirties, someone who should bring us experience. Young is always a risk for us nowadays... i dont really like perisic but in my opinion hes much better.
The next thing were our missing chances.. well what can i say? We need to make those on the bright side at least we created enough. 
I think with what we can create theres stil a realistic chance to win 2:0 in turin. 
We also have hakimi and lukaku at our disposal.
One thing i liked and that doesn‚Äôt get mentioned to much here: i like the subs conte made, he really wanted to win and subed risky without fear i liked that.

"This was no Juve masterclass or reaction or whatever as you are gonna hear from the media and rival fans, we lost this because we gifted them 2 goals plain and simple, if in a semifinal against a strong team, we are gonna give away a totally unnecessary penalty and then our goalkeeper suddenly decides to come out and make an amateurish mistake to give away another goal, and in the 2nd half we get 2 clear goal scoring opportunities 1v1s and we miss them, then how are we gonna win the game doing things like this ? Not counting the amount of balls Juve gave away in their own half and we failed to create anything out of them. I thought Conte prepared the game really well again and it showed in the 20 or 25 mins before the pen, and if it weren't for individual mistakes we would again be talking about a Conte masterclass.

We could win games when we self sabotage against lesser teams and we have done so, but against strong teams, like Conte said, the margin of error should be the bare minimum which obviously wasn't today, I know many people will say it's crucial to have a Lukaku sub but I don't think so, imo the problem was, is and will be the fact that Sanchez is not good enough, I don't mean to single him out from this game, he's simply not good he can't score to save his life, most balls that he receives he ends up wasting them or making the worst possible decision, whenever he's involved in an action he slows it down with his constant turning around and eventually kills it, he puts a good performance here and there but not enough, he was good but not anymore.

But hey we go again against them next week, we are still in this, but first eyes on Fiorentina this Friday, Forza Inter!!!",glsg3wj,lb7dlt,FCInterMilan,2021-02-03 06:18:57,Lothar18,5

Yeah they do have perisic but he doesnt make good matches with Conte as he did before and with bayern.

on the other side they did good they have quality players i like hakimi and darmian as a sub

they should get rid of young, kolarov, and perisic or buy a quality winger and put it there and make a sub any of those 3

"As I replied to another user above:

Facts we know for sure about the financial situation are:

- Inter had many sponsorship deals with Chinese partners which couldn't be renewed due to the Chinese government restrictions on foreign investments.

- Inter used to rely a lot on matchday revenues (which usually is a good thing btw) and those are gone due to covid.

- Suning can't invest directly into Inter due to the Chinese government restrictions.

Inter is not in financial troubles per se. It's a set of events (sponsorship dealings expiring in this period, Chinese government decisions) that alongside covid contribute to make inter financial situation slightly worse than the others. Hence the 20% decreased revenues from the Deloitte report.

And imho inter was on solid financial bases* so I'm not too worried. There are teams in Italy (Milan, Roma) and Europe (Barcelona) whose fans should be way more worried than us.

/* Imho Suning looking for new investors when they know they can't guarantee money from China anymore speaks about their reliability and honesty to our team.

Link with actual data (in Italian): https://www.ultimouomo.com/inter-vendita-suning/

And just one more thing to keep in mind when reading financial news about Inter:

Inter financial statements are not public. The only information we have are what they say to the public shareholders meetings which is very generic. The only number actually said by inter is the 102m loss (which is not that big even compared to just serie a teams). When you read about player wages, sponsorship, merchandise revenues, etc those numbers are either guessed by journalists, suggested by players agents or just made up (and in Italy is often the latter)

"[https://www.vogue.it/moda/article/bureau-borsche-nuovo-logo-inter-milano](https://www.vogue.it/moda/article/bureau-borsche-nuovo-logo-inter-milano)

Here is the rationale behind the logo change (in Italian). Spoiler alert: the previous one looked bad when displayed small on Instagram.

At least the video is better, but they were great even with the previous logo. The all I M thing is well played, not gonna lie. At least we got something out of it instead of ""not for everyone"" which didn't make any sense to me.

BTW We're gonna get used to it. As Enzo Ferrari said ""The most beutiful ~~cars~~ logos are the ones that win"". I hope it will become very beautiful :D

\---

For the rest I M just gonna copy-paste my previous comments on the logo because I M lazy as the agency that designed it /s

As a designer, I can't say I don't like the logo per se (just as I think the Jj logo is not as technically bad as other people says), it's just bad as an Inter logo.

You can't even say it had to be changed to be simpler because Inter logo already was one of the more minimalistic around in the football world. But what I really cannot stand is the change of the blue (it's AZZURRO in italian which means light blue) and the gold which are literally written in our foundation document.

3-5-2 system is working wonders for us but looks like we have a problem in this sort of games. From my understanding, the way you beat such defensive teams is by [widening defenses using sides](https://worldfootballindex.com/2020/07/low-block-park-the-bus-jose-mourinho-diego-simeone/), to create gaps in the middle, or by having creative players that open up defenses somehow. Eriksen and Sanchez are examples of creative players that were the key to unlock Torino's defense, however in theory Barella and Brozovic both have the necessary quality to create plays. So why did we struggle so much in the first half?

Well for one, luck plays some part. For comparison, Rube managed to unlock the game early against Cagliari on a corner, which has some stupidly low chance to happen ([xG from corners in Serie A](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/set-piece-analysis/analysis-offensive-corners-europe-top-five-leagues-near-post-set-piece-analysis-tactical-analysis-tactics) is around 2%); once you put the first in, biggest part of the job is done (like against Genoa). The equalizer from Torino came totally randomly so I won't even discuss it.

The problem is generating opportunities from active play. Many times in the first half we relied on Skriniar and Bastoni to go deep in the final third to bring additional resources, however we can't rely on them to make proper crosses. They should act as a pivot point for Hakimi / Perisic, nothing more. In my view, this is a problem with this sort of formation: in 4-x-x systems you can rely on wingbacks to create triangulations on the sides, which have clearly different characteristics compared to LB/RB in 3 man defenses, like ours.

Another thing is that Conte likes to play ""safe"" football. Without fans I started to notice how many times you could hear ""don't risk it"" or ""play it simple"" from the bench, directing the play horizontally or towards the sides (understandable, as losing the ball on the sides is much less riskier than losing it on the centre of the pitch).

I guess I don't have a solution in mind, I'm just throwing there random thoughts hoping for somebody to collect them. What do you think will be the key to unlock these sort of matchups?",gr0zl0e,m56ocy,FCInterMilan,2021-03-16 00:26:08,nov4chip,4

"I would like us to try swapping Skriniar and De Vrij positions sometimes in the attacking phase. We depend so much on the right side, adding De Vrij will boost our build up immensely. That only should be done with teams defending in their own half, because De Vrij is important centrally when we build up from the back under pressure.",gr0ebpx,m56ocy,FCInterMilan,2021-03-15 21:37:06,UnsuppressedAnger,5

"there've been a lot of questions about why Gagliardini is so poorly rated in the last week or so. Ignoring the fact that Eriksen was quite important in the build up to the goal yesterday within minutes of coming on, just to explain:

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at weapons, there's a measure called MoA - minutes of angle - to measure accuracy. I imagine you could do something very similar with footballers and passing/shooting. Eriksen has a much lower variability in his passing (e.g. always pass to this one point 30 m away) than Gagliardini does. The difference it makes in our team's posture is incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

When Gags gets the ball, and I really noticed this in a few matches last season, I cant remember exactly which one, but he had a perfect chance to play the ball across to Candreva and fucked up the pass, it got intercepted even - he generally isnt perfectly on target. That means our players need to compensate for that mistake, and it generally slows down our play. Infact, our posture needs to be more risk-adverse with Gagliardini in possession, as we need to assume he might fuck up the pass and either our attack has slowed down or we've turned over possession. This means our players need to be pinned back a bit more, and we cant be as forward, which means we cant have as many players near the opponents goals, thus we get crowded out more.

&amp;#x200B;

With Eriksen, the team feel confident in his passing, they know he's gonna put it in a much healthier position. By not wasting 1-2-3 seconds compensating for a slightly misplaced pass, our attack is more fluid, we can take opponents out of shape, and keep the tempo up. Indeed, we can even commit (e.g.) our wing-backs further forward, because they retain confidence in the passing - clearly meaning we can load the opponent with more players and get ready to score.

&amp;#x200B;

In similar ways to Ranocchia, Gagliardini isnt bad on paper - Ranocchia's actually not a bad defender. His problem was that every now and then in a match he'd have a complete lapse of concentration and we'd almost inevitably concede. This means we need to be quite risk adverse and get ready to step up when this momoent happens

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's the sort of micro-improvement that makes such a difference between losing and winning tbh

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On a similar note, though. I think Conte has pretty much improved every single one of our players. Not just by being better, but by being more rounded? Lukaku contributes immensely to broader play, Lautaro has gotten to be very hard working, as well as a good goalscorer. Skriniar is back to his best and getting to be quite good at ball distribution (worst of the 3 at the back, but De Vrij is a world class ball playing CB, and Bastoni will be too). Hakimi works hard in defense as well as going forwards. Barella has gotten quite good at being creative (e.g. scoring/assisting), and I expect next season will continue that track. Eriksen is a far more complete midfielder - arguably not as good as he was in his career prime, but overall much more rounded.",gqzuuhy,m56ocy,FCInterMilan,2021-03-15 17:16:57,reddithenry,6

"Here‚Äôs what you should know about Juventus: it‚Äôs a club formed in the image of its owner. A soulless, corporate, sterile, corrupt, machine. 

They won their first European Cup a few minutes after their own fans were killed in the Heysel disaster. Their club doctor was sentenced to 22 months in prison for supplying the players with performance enhancing drugs - 281 different kinds of them - in the mid 1990s when they won their second and last cup. Also, the sporting director at the time - Luciano Moggi - would go on to become general manager and bring about their relegation to Serie B because he fixed the fuck out of their matches in the early 2000s.

I went to the international champions cup game in Philadelphia, it was bayern Munich vs Juventus. In front of me was a man (probably about 65 y.o.) I had recognized because he was a member at a high end country club I used to work at. He was sitting there in a Juventus jersey and a scarf. After the first goal for Juve (they sadly won 2-0) the man turned around, took off his scarf and then proceeded to hold it into the face of two boys in bayern jerseys (no older than 5) and scream at them that their team sucked etc. etc. and not a single Juventus fan around him thought he was in the wrong. That happened probably a dozen more times up til the end of the game.

Good at padding his stats but gives 0 in defense (not acceptable in serie a) and won‚Äôt truly fight for the team.

"Quite the embarrassment to drop out in the round of 16 for the second year in a row. They brought Ronaldo not to win the Scudetto but to win the Champions League. Yet, they've performed considerably worse after his arrival and now are even looking to lose champion status in Italy to their biggest rivals. They lost to 10 man Porto - a team that's 10 points behind first place, from a league that's not even considered top 5 in Europe. Simply embarrassing.

But I think this is kind of embarrassing for all of us in Serie A. It's not a good look to see a supposed Italian powerhouse to lose in this fashion (though I'm relishing this moment), nor do we have that much to boast about since we failed to escape the group stages two years running (albeit due to terrible luck). We need to challenge for at least quarter finals next year, and with this squad I think it's totally possible. Let's hope for Atalanta to make it past Real.",gqdulbe,m1ig6m,FCInterMilan,2021-03-10 06:55:47,young_gam,62

"Huge, huge win. We keep breaking the longest winning streaks in the league, Atalanta was extremely in form and the toughest possible opponent right now. We were also under pressure from other teams winning over the weekend.

After we scored, Atalanta forced us to give up possession even more than we wanted to. Their press didn't really allow us to keep the ball for significant stretches to interrupt their attacks. Credit to them. In this difficult situation, though, we displayed a truly exceptional defensive performance: despite constant pressure, we never lost concentration for a second, everyone contributed (incredible job from Lautaro and Eriksen for instance) and we didn't actually concede many chances at all. Defensive performances may not catch the eye, but they're deserving of praise as much as great offensive displays. Again, we're talking about one of the most prolific attacks in Europe over the last few years in Atalanta. Not conceding is impressive.

And, most importantly, a great demonstration of mental toughness, which is the final step we truly need to take in order to win.

Right now I don't really care about potential future tactical scenarios in Europe. We haven't won anything in 10 years and have more immediate objectives to think about. I'll only say that this isn't the only way we can play, and we've shown it various times. Also, people seem to forget Conte took us to a European final just a few months ago.",gqb599x,m0qw6q,FCInterMilan,2021-03-09 16:51:22,Elros_of_Numenor,8

On the other hand I am slightly frustrated that we couldn't take advantage of the spaces Atalanta left for us to counter. Our players are so used to structured build up that when they are faced with space to run into they seem to freeze up and start stumbling over themselves.

In serie A we can get away with this because 99% of teams park the bus, but looking to the future and European football this is something we need to seriously address.

I was wearing headphones so all of his voice is loud and clear, and that became the highlight of the game for me, as we don't create that much but still came up with grand win. It's all that matters for now. We should grinding out every little detail so we don't stumble.

"I think my heart stopped. Help. You can criticize how boring we were, how much we suffered, how we didn't ""deserve"" to win (only 3 shots on target for Atalanta, btw)... But THIS is the sort of match that win you titles.

We suffered. We fought. We scrapped for a win. And we got it. These 3 points are MASSIVE, since Atalanta is likely to take away points from some of Juve, Milan, and whoever else is running behind us.

I'm so fucking happy - you can't always dominate and score three goals, especially against a team like Atalanta. We won, and that's all that matters. Now we have a week of rest, which was very much needed after today's performance.

"This was a very hard game and probably the only game from our current 7 game winning streak where you could say that we were lucky to get 3 points. Atalanta played well and created better chances. Handa had some great saves yet again. I think we defended very well, especially individual defending by ≈†kriniar. However we made a lot of sloppy passing mistakes in defense and midfield, which both allowed them space and squandered our ambitions. We managed to create some good runs and counter attacks, but always failed to create a genuine chance out of it. In the end, the goal came from pinball in Atalanta's box, definitely not a graceful goal. I think nobody could argue if the game ended as a draw. Overall, the team just looks tired, we already did against Parma.

But in the end, such wins can be just as satisfying. Grinding out such fixtures and coming out with 3 points is incredibly important to title charges. What a brilliant result for us, so important.",gq9c1qe,m0qw6q,FCInterMilan,2021-03-09 05:40:51,Cerozz,30

"Ehhh, I was a little worried about Sanchez starting against Parma as well, and yet it ended up working out perfectly. Conte's the one witnessing every training session, and at this point it's been basically proven he's not playing favorites with Vidal just because he asked for him.

I'll believe in Conte's decision, Atalanta has always required us to change the way our midfield operates completely (like at the end of last season, when we tried a high pressing Barella trequartista for the first time, and it ended up neutralizing Atalanta for like, 70 minutes).

Plus, do keep in mind going forward that Eriksen can't start literally every match ahahah, he was bound to be benched one match or another whether for resting or tactical reasons. A rested, in form Vidal is a very good player as well, so hopefully him being in good form is why Conte decided to play him.",gq84fiv,m0j2ho,FCInterMilan,2021-03-09 00:30:40,5kyLegend,38

We definitely shouldn't have let them score that one goal, but I'm also glad we managed a win against a shit team that never went on the pitch to try and win, but that not only would have killed for a draw, they also kept jumping on our players, kicking and fouling them as if this was a match that decided whether they'd be relegated or not.

Next match will be one of the hardest yet, Atalanta is in very good form and they can be insanely dangerous. But for now, we got 3 **MASSIVE** points - let's keep this up!",gppb5kv,lxw71u,FCInterMilan,2021-03-05 05:46:39,5kyLegend,6

"I'm not massively convinced tbh. The point of sovereign wealth investment funds are to make a profit for their country (simplistically). How does Inter align to that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can believe they'll finance for us - they have the wealth to borrow money cheaply, so why not lend it on to Inter at an attractive interest rate. Might even buy a minority stake as part of that. But a sovereign wealth fund which has historic investments in start ups (e.g. Uber), tech sector, infrastructure, solar projects, etc, doesnt really align IMHO.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from loan and a minority stake as part of the loan (perhaps to keep the interest rates lower for example), I can see a world where they do something like buy, build a new stadium, and lease us the stadium whilst making commercial revenues and buying land in Milan.

"I‚Äôve seen a few comments on this and I just want to make one point about why these Arab sovereign wealth funds - accurately described as primarily interested in building what are essentially financial cushions for the inevitable decline of the oil business - looking to invest in not clearly/immediately lucrative football clubs: prestige. That‚Äôs all it is. The prestige of owning a European giant with a history of success and creating a dynasty is worth intangible billions, especially for these countries. The same could be said of owning a club and turning it into a European giant. Look at what Abu Dhabi is doing with City. They‚Äôre playing amazing football, on the precipice of a mind blowing quadruple. To be entirely honest, their ownership is a minor detail in the immediate context of sporting success. 

We can complain about the political implications of this - or any other investment. I get it. But I just don‚Äôt see how top level football competition is sustainable, especially with talk of a revamped, even more lucrative even more money hungry, Champions League. UEFA and most of these leagues are culpable for the situation we find ourselves in. 

Now, do I want ownership and an approach to business that‚Äôs like Bayern? Yes, absolutely! But that‚Äôs possible in the context of the well-run Bundesliga. Lega Calcio is a mess; Italy is a mess.

Ehhh I thibk key player is stretching it. Has he improved quality in the middle: undoubtedly. He also has gotten much more game time. But at same time if I had to choose 5 core players he definitely is not in there. Furthermore the argument that he scored key goals doesn't make him key (I mean darmian scored 2 recently and I don't think anyone will argue that he is a key player either),gwa0vb6,n10bzx,FCInterMilan,2021-04-29 17:42:44,barcalondon,42

"If you look at it in isolation, the swap for Vidal/Eriksen has made a huge difference in quality, ability to keep the ball, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

He's not, yet, a key playe rin the sense of the level of creativity we should be able to get from the guy. I'd like to see him produce more in that way. But he has created some very important cross-field/through balls that have led to opportunities and goals against tough opponents we'd struggle with.

&amp;#x200B;

I think, if he stays, next season is where I'd expect to see more of him come out of his shell. For now, the critical thing has been to play, build confidence, and integrate with the team. Once you've got the foundations in place, you can then exploit and offer 'more edge'.",gwa42qp,n10bzx,FCInterMilan,2021-04-29 18:30:36,reddithenry,11
"Yes he has been key. He might not pop out on stat sheets or anything, but watching the team before and after, Eriksen passes the eye test, and adds a couple more dimensions to the team, while not giving up too much defensively either.

First, the press resistance with him is drastically improved. With Eriksen, we basically have a 2nd Brozovic on the pitch. Before him, good pressing teams could mark Broz out of the build up, and we‚Äôd get stuck. Barella and the wingbacks would have to pull back a little bit to help, and we‚Äôd end up launching Lukaku a bunch of long balls with nobody to knock them down to. During really bad stretches we looked like a relegation side trying to hold a 85th minute draw, and it was ugly.

With Eriksen out there and just as comfortable linking up the back 3 with the attack, there isn‚Äôt the same worry that we won‚Äôt be able to break a press. Barella and Hakimi can freely bomb forward on counters, and marking Broz out of the game doesn‚Äôt pay off as much anymore. I think teams know that, and that some who might have before didn‚Äôt even try marking Broz out of the game, because of Eriksen‚Äôs presence. 

And then he also balances the attack. He‚Äôs not bagging a ton of assists or goals, and funny enough I think his contributions in the final 3rd are where he could stand to improve the most with Inter. But he‚Äôs still Christian Eriksen, and you can‚Äôt ignore him to focus on Barella and Hakimi on the other half of the pitch, like you could Gagliardini or Vidal. The revival of Perisic out wide also helps here, but Eriksen at LCM definitely contributed to that.",gwb4dsg,n10bzx,FCInterMilan,2021-04-29 23:49:53,rth9139,11
"There is no doubt about it. After he scored against Milan in the Coppa Italia, he started almost every game and the difference in quality between him and whoever was starting over him before (Gagliardini or Vidal, mostly) is night and day.

"I guess it depends on what you mean by key player. To me, it means if he is out of the game we lose a lot and are a worse side. Based on that, I think he is one of the most key players (so are Barella and Brozo). I have no faith in Vidal this season and Gagliardini has a low ceiling. Sensi would be good but is very unreliable. If Lauti missed time, I feel okay with Alexis. If Perisic or Hakimi miss, I feel okay with Darmian and Young.

"Yes, huge step in incorporating him into our starting 11. I don't know about you but he still seems to be a little bit timid, meaning that he does not take that extra step to make a key pass or through ball/cross  like a regista but always seems to play it a little bit safe in hope of not losing the ball. Obviously Conte wants him to be a little more reserved and defensive in that role. Overall I would just like to see him take a little bit more risks in his playmaking (even if that means losing the ball in an occasion or two).

It took him one year to be fully integrated into the team but I'm happy he know understands his role in Conte's system.

"Absolutely, he turned our midfield around when he moved to the mezzala position. He always quickens our attacking movements, finds a clever pass, always dangerous when he shoots (very rarely misses the goal even if he doesn't score), he has learned to fall back as Conte asks and is one of the players who runs the most on the team.

"hot take, really hot take but here i go

Im really happy for all of this, but i still feel like the only logical step forward is bringing allegri, in the goals of solidifying this squad as a top 8 europa club, for the next couple years

in my humble opinion conte is what in here we call a ""tecnico sacapuntos"", a manager that is quite effective at harvesting points, but lacks that mentality and quick flexibility you need for knockout rounds, instead he's more ordered and focuses more in solidity (which for pazza inter and this rebuilding years of course it helped) but i feel like now theres only so much you can grow, and that allegri was the right move

but as we know there's rumours about allegri coming back to rube and all of that, and here something like that in the plans is highly unlikely, the team morale and cohesion with the manager is very high, and talking about this is quite early, we don't even won the scudetto, so its very likely that allegri will sign with rube in the next months and i don't even know if we'll stay with conte for the next CL and all of that, of course a name isn't a guarantee of anything, but i really felt like that was the next step",gwc9rlw,myir8k,FCInterMilan,2021-04-30 04:18:25,WHO_IS_3R,2

We're also lucky Abisso disallowed their goal. I mean, I think it was pretty obvious their player put his shoulder in the middle, preventing Handanovic from grabbing the ball.

At this point I'm convinced Conte is even reluctant to field Handanovic, but is doing it because we more than should be capable to clinching the title, and he doesn't want to put that scar on his career of having been consistently great for about a decade, only to dramatically decline in the last season and dramatically DRAMATICALLY decline in the last 2 months of a potential title-winning season lol.",gvtmihx,my6vnt,FCInterMilan,2021-04-25 22:52:25,Mignelli14,2

Its a shame we didn't take all 3 points last night, Spezia defended for their lives and our attack were clearly exhausted making stupid decisions, but 1 is better than 0, we have to be better in our next 3 games, they are the ""easiest"" games we have and hopefully by the time it comes to playing Rube, we've secured the Scudetto.",gvh5e33,mvoxvf,FCInterMilan,2021-04-23 02:46:12,Broken_Pikachu,2

Lukaku also had a stinker and our attack really needs work if we are going to make the jump to the next level in Europe like we all want. 

Our creativity down the middle is non-existent. Even if Conte's system is wingback oriented there needs to be a threat in the middle of the park if we want to score consistently, especially against teams that sit back.",gvdbgsu,mvoxvf,FCInterMilan,2021-04-22 05:02:24,blertyuh,10

"The problem with Conte is that he can't easily win important games, we mostly struggle with a 1-0. We played our best games when we had nothing to lose and all to gain. Once we got on top with reasonable advantage it's just grinding marginal victories and draws. It's not terrible but this is bound to happen, especially if our attack is constantly failing.

More specifically, Conte relies too much on the same 11 players with very little variations. Our players are tired and we only play the same ones, all the time. Moreover we lack fantasy and creation, we need a good dribbler that can win 1-1s pretty badly",gvdb0mn,mvoxvf,FCInterMilan,2021-04-22 04:59:06,Sgruntlar,2
"When luck is not on your side and you‚Äôre starting to get tired of playing 3 games a week this is the kind of result you can expect. 1-1 and it‚Äôs not even a deserved goal from them, same shit (and result) that happened last Sunday. I feel so bad because we could‚Äôve easily gotten the 3 points here: two offsides and a post weren‚Äôt enough just because Handa is having the worst week of his season. 

Despite this, our playing was very poor today. The more we go on in the league, the more it feels to be on a lost ship in the middle of the ocean. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre starting to have trouble controlling the game, we‚Äôre nervous and because of this we‚Äôre prone to make that little mistake that (for two times now) can decide the whole game.

We‚Äôre still +9 on our competitors, we reduced our needed points to win from 12 to 9 thanks to Sassuolo, everything is still in our hands. But we‚Äôre clearly running out of fuel, hopefully we‚Äôll get a boost by winning the next game vs Verona...",gvdav5q,mvoxvf,FCInterMilan,2021-04-22 04:58:01,Roaming_Dinosaur,6

"2 points thrown away today, absolutely. Many of our players just looked exhausted (Barella, Eriksen, Brozovic, Bastoni), and two in particular really were disappointing today (Handanovic, who had one save to make the whole game, and instead of diving he just laid down on the spot, and Lukaku, who singlehandedly cost us the game with that open goal miss, all mixed with a really disappointing performance in general).

I thought Lautaro had an amazing match, and Hakimi was really good today too. But their efforts weren't enough to carry us to a win - which fucking sucks, because we went from 11 wins in a row to drawing with Napoli (which is fine) and fucking Spezia, which is **not** fine, especially when they offer your best forward a free goal, and he misses it.

Yeah, tomorrow's my birthday and Inter definitely didn't give me a great gift, I'll admit. We could have gone to 6-7 points from winning the title (depending on Atalanta's result tomorrow), and instead we went to 8-9. We absolutely cannot afford to drop any points in the next 3 matches, if we want to go against Roma and Juve without a worry.

Goddammit.

(also, Chiffi was absolutely shit. One potential penalty on Lautaro not even checked, and immediately after he stops a golden chance after a Spezia player clearly, visibly dived. Screw him too.)",gvd9ely,mvoxvf,FCInterMilan,2021-04-22 04:47:46,5kyLegend,3

"**Official Inter statement from the site:**

&gt; MILAN - FC Internazionale Milano confirm that the Club is no longer part of the Super League project.

&gt; We are always committed to giving fans the best football experience; innovation and inclusion are part of our DNA since our foundation. Our engagement with all stakeholders to improve the football industry will never change.

&gt; Inter believes that football, like every sector of activity, must have an interest in constantly improving its competitions, to keep on exciting fans of all ages around the world, within a framework of financial sustainability.

&gt; With this vision we look forward to carry on working together with institutions and all stakeholders for the future of the sport we all love.

This thread will now be pinned as the primary discussion megathread for our ESL involvement. Please be civil when discussing, as the same subreddit rules about discrimination, being offensive, etc. still apply. Default sorting will be set to new so that the discussion can run freely.

For the most part we left submissions up over the past few days, be it memes, personal rants or news as people were rightfully enraged. But from this announcement forward we'll try to limit the amount of personal rants and memes posts and try to focus on any future news so that the subreddit feed is clear. Use this thread to vent your frustration or relief that we're out and let's focus on actual news with future threads.",gvb6sa6,mvd4z8,FCInterMilan,2021-04-21 19:02:47,Cerozz,1

Personally  I prefer to stick to Serie A and Champions League. Sell all our marketable players  if we have to and invest in young in-house talent.

"As it's clear that you're referring to my post too I'll state the reasons why I hate this. Which are my own reasons. I never said everybody should agree and maybe I'll even change my mind in a few years.

* On the economic side of things: this is not the most reasonable thing to do. This is not the only way to make football more profitable. This is not a way to make football more sustainable (rofl, seariously? I didn't even think anybody could say this with a straight face). This is the only way 12 clubs owners that went into a shitload of debt (for their own bad decisions, this needs to be clear) can save their ass without changing their business model, cut expenses or step down. That's it to me, plain and simple. I'm not even sure they wanted to go on with this plan, this could be just a tactic to blackmail the UEFA into giving them more money that exploded in their face.
* On the economic side of things (part2): Since the 80s UEFA and Lega Serie A did everything the big teams wanted. If the big12 are the big12 is because the system was in their favor from the begininning. They lobbied the UEFA for decades into giving them more and more money. They just did this step by step without forcing anything. Now they need even more and UEFA - which is a shitty almost mafia-like association because of them - is somehow in the way and they want UEFA cut too. And even if I am a big12 fan I can't stand this greediness beyond everything else.
* On the sport side of things: this is the first time (that I know ofc) that they want to change the basics of the sport just for the money. The pyramid system is not something you can remove from football and still call it football. The casuality of this game (given by its low score factor) cannot be changed without completely changing the nature of the game. I'm not naive, I know on the long term the same teams win over and over again, but that single match casuality must be preserve. In the new league we could (and believe me, we would) lose every single match and still that wouldn't mean anything.
* On the moral side of things (ye, nobody cares I know): Yes football is a global franchise now, I know. They always had the money of dictatorships and I just pretended it didn't happen. They decided to make a World Cup in Qatar killing thousands in the process? ""Well"", I said, ""I just won't watch it, what can I do about it?"" (Am I a bad person? Yes, probably). So, you could say, ""why you draw the line now you piece of shit?"" Because now it's my team that's saying loudly: we are behind this, we support this, we don't care. The team I used to go see at the stadium with my dad and all the usual crap you say about how you love the team you support. Before last sunday I could say to all my ""not footbally"" friends: ""Yes, I know football is crap, FIFA and UEFA they're all a bunch of assholes, but Inter, look, Inter is different"" and I would tell them the history, the colors of the night, the ""brothers of the world"", Gigi Simoni and Arpad Weisz, the magic of seeing Ronaldo, the loyalty of Zanetti, and whatever bullshit I'm obviously too old to believe in. Now the spell is broken. Now they said loud and clear to my face: ""we're no different than UEFA, even more, WE WANT TO BE UEFA"". I know Zhang - and even Moratti and Pellegrini - were just businessman but I could fool myself into believing Inter was still something more. We would never betray our values and the sport. But I was clearly wrong.

"See if you‚Äôre being selfish and just looking out for us then it‚Äôs not a bad move. We get paid a ton of money, get to play with the best clubs and have to never worry about getting relegated.

But look at the Napoli‚Äôs and Roma‚Äôs of Europe. These guys deserve it just as much as us. Everyone loves Atalanta. The chances of there being another Atalanta are almost 0 now.

"I agree, most hate comments are just emotional. I don't agree with the superleague either, but most clubs today are so far away from their history and their values that it makes no sense to use it as argument in favour or against anything. 

Also I don't understand how a new league would ruin the existing football. Clubs play their leagues and some European competition in the week all the time: just replace the Championship League with the Super League instead. 

That the idea of teams not being relegated is against fair play I 100% agree, but this is the only argument in my opinion, the rest really is just emotional hate.",gv7bgup,muqyg0,FCInterMilan,2021-04-20 22:08:22,evergreengt,3

I am not going to somehow stop supporting them, at least now. I'm going to root for them until the end of the season, because I'm sure all our players and staff heard about the ESL news the moment we did. Sunday night, on the news.

...So, having said that: this is going to be a tricky match. On paper, it should be 3 easy points, but it's clear that ""easy points"" stopped existing for us. The last time a Milan team underestimated Spezia, the WHOLE Scudetto race got flipped around: they expected to go +5 from us since we had Lazio, they went -1 instead. And they never saw first place again.

A win here means 9 points would be left to the title. In case Milan wins, that is. We're **so** close... We can do this, I hope our players truly play every game as if it's a final!",gv6xw3y,mukb83,FCInterMilan,2021-04-20 20:06:50,5kyLegend,9

"Disclaimer: I am not PRO ESL.

However, with the current state of things, owning a big club with good players is not financially sustainable. Players cost a lot and have huge salaries, so in order to be financially stable while being competitive you would need to progress far into the CL every year, have almost full stadium every game and be a marketing wizard to just float and not drown. And this is not taking Covid into account (empty stadiums etc). 

The founding clubs  of the Super League were $1.2bn in debt 1 year **before** Covid. That just shows that modern football is not sustainable if you are one of the 'big' clubs. In my eyes, this is the only view that could justify this move by the clubs.

Do I think there were better solutions to change things in football? Most probably yes, but bear in mind that the clubs didn't do this out of the blue, they have been trying to get UEFA to listen to them for years. 

Also, some of us (Inter, Milan, Arsenal come to mind) were fucking strangled by FFP for years, which ironically was implemented to help out the smaller clubs and keep the big ones in check. We all know how that turned out, the owners of  Chelsea, City, PSG  and others kept injecting millions and millions of euros into their clubs by finding loopholes in the system while UEFA turned a blind eye. I didn't see UEFA come out and apologise to the clubs they crippled with FFP. But now, when their own financial interests are jeopardized, suddenly it's all hands on deck.

"Uefa has many problems but the solution to heal football is not in raising the revenues through superleagues. In the long run even that wont be enough. 

I do support every change that increases fair competitions such as salary caps and even drafts if they are implementable. Less money gap between big and small clubs is what the world should push for in order to create a fair competitive sport where the best quality football can be generated. 

The superleague is the end of healthy competition and a circlejerk of moneylenders. As fans how can you support this? UEFA is indeed part of the problem as they allowed this to happen, so they need reforms for sure but this is far from a solution. Public ownerships and government regulations would be ideal but not realistic, so it is fair to work a deal with the owners. 

I am quite sad as I believe this will happen, and football will be more and more plastic. More and more full of reality show, fancy shit etc. People like me who went to the curva and lived the passion of the club in their hometown are heartbroken to see they matter less and less to say the least.",gv7ka5p,mub640,FCInterMilan,2021-04-20 23:12:19,afg500,2

What I'm trying to say is that I'd love to see Inter with Pirelli slapped on the front in a Italian league that is healthy and competitive  but that is not an option anymore.

The options are join and be financially relieved in the company of other biggest clubs in the world or stay and slowly regress into a super market club for the Super League clubs, watch all our players slowly leave to make that step up in their career from playing in what's gonna be a weak Serie A.

"My two favorite leagues, in order, that I watch are the Bundesliga and Serie A. I also watch some Spanish and English football as well, as I'm sure most of us do, but those are the two leagues I've grown to enjoy the most. Find the most interesting. The countries I most wish to visit some day, even two of the languages I wish most to learn. 

I do have a favorite club in Germany, have for years. In what was an exceptional case of bad luck, that team is Gladbach and, obviously, we were in the same group of the Champions League this year. That...was not a fun experience. In any case, if I find myself losing my love for this club, be it by choice or if it just naturally disappears after this, then Gladbach becomes my singular club and I will back them with everything I've got. Germany's refusal to join this charade is so encouraging, such a great sign of their fan culture and ownership laws doing precisely what they were designed to do. 

As for Serie A, I dunno, while I doubt I would become a true ""fan"" of anyone, I will say that, if you can ignore all the facism in their Ultras, Lazio really is a pretty nifty club.

As said by a colleague of ours above, owners come and go but the colours are forever and Zhang won‚Äôt be my president forever because he sees Inter as a brand, I see it as a super important part of my life, an eternal love. 

After this long and boring regression, even though Inter may not play Serie A or CL in the future, and football will never be the same as yesterday, I will never stop supporting these beautiful colours. 15 billionaires are not strong enough to make this beautiful sport a shameless and ruthless money cow, lacking passion and romanticism.

"OK, the reason the big clubs want more money is because they spend so much more money buying players and paying them high salaries in attempts to (more or less) buy their position in the league, buy advancement in Champions League, etc. There are wonderful exceptions (Leicester's run to their league title a few years back, Ajax's run through the knockout runs of the CL) but for the most part, the big spenders reach the top spots in the table, with their popularity (and TV money) helping these lesser-spending teams compete for mid-table slots, the occasional Europa League, the incredibly rare challenge to the top.

Meanwhile tickets for the stadium-going fans ratchet ever upwards.

There is an attempt with FFP to push back against outright injections of big money to buy players and therefore leagues and CL positions, but FFP is flawed as we have seen.

I don't know what the answers to any of this are. I don't think this 'Super League' is a step in the right direction, though. I'm nervous about the fallout here to the national leagues, to the idea of fair sport and earning your place in such leagues through *on the field* results. The absence of relegation leads to absolute jokes of teams in American professional sports, that mire for decades, raking in guaranteed TV revenue and fielding poorly-coached teams of mediocre players season after season, yet rarely being completely without hope due to salary cap enforced free agency chipping away players from the successful teams, and beneficial draft position from the amateur ranks for the unsuccessful teams...

All these formulas have issues. There's SO much money involved, the upside of which is money for youth football across the country, and players being able to command actual market value for their dedication to the sport and hard work to reach the pinnacle of performance. The downside of which is established huge teams having generational advantages.

"I said it in our discord.

I understand where these clubs are coming from.  They basically put people in seats and ads in front of viewers in the Champions League.  EL is a prime example of the revenue it generates without these clubs.  UEFA hasn't helped anyone during the pandemic and still haven't decided if they are going to wipe FFP regulations for the past 3 years which if they don't will heavily affect these clubs.  I get it.  The prize pot for the CL isn't even 1/2 of the actual revenue that is generated by broadcasting/ad dollars.  These clubs do all the work and UEFA profits ten fold.

&amp;#x200B;

I totally understand where they are coming from, this doesn't replace domestic leagues, it replaces the Champions League where there is no revenue sharing, UEFA keeps around 50% of the revenue generated by the competition (2018/2019 UEFA paid out a total of 1.9 billion out of 3.8572 billion).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the fence tbh.  In one way I'd rather watch the top clubs play each other constantly than having to sit and watch Inter vs Sparta over and over.  In the other way I'm a traditionalist and prefer to have as little change as possible (barring VAR and maybe adding another fucking ref on the field).",gv161nz,mtn63l,FCInterMilan,2021-04-19 09:17:43,BrokenRetina,14

I will be very disappointed with Inter if this Super League idea becomes reality. New league, new dumb logo, new sponsor, new stadium... not the same Inter I grew up with, I'd find it too hard to maintain the attachment. This feels too much like a soulless corporate brand, the complete loss of our identity. I refuse to support a marketing brand - it is something you can accept in america - but I cannot accept it as an Italian, it is a disgusting sellout of our fan culture. Next thing you know, the team will change city and name as they do in the NBA and tickets are 200 bucks. This football is sad and sparkless, no magic, no romanticism.

Football will even more than now become the entertainment for rich people. The beauty of football is that it comes from the bottom, is that it is a somewhat fair sporting system, is that it gives a chance to every little team, is that Sampdoria, Leicester, Valencia can win the league, and Red Star Belgrade can win the European cup. Is that every small town has a team somewhere in a lower league but can dream of getting at the top, and every small town player can somehow find himself playing vs CR7.

Should this go through, my inter will be gone forever. The new inter will be another thing. I will cherish the old memories and look forward to support some local teams.",gv0sbrr,mtn63l,FCInterMilan,2021-04-19 07:15:44,afg500,15

"Just my two cents:

ESL is a solution. The wrong solution to the problem that has been plaguing soccer for a long time: financial sustainability.

There are three problems atm: 

* Relegation at all levels is a huge burdens and cause a lot of instability. Be it the inability to qualify to the CL, or relegation to the second division. The latter in some cases mean even the risk of bankruptcy, since you are still stuck with all the salaries, but the revenues greatly decrease. Most of the time, CL qualifications are the main decider about the market window in the offseason.

* Money is king. Too many time a bored Sheikh comes along, bankroll a small club and win anything they want. In this case UEFA tried the financial fair play, but I think it's fair to say it has been a complete failure. Then the Sheikh get bored of the club, and the club becomes shit again. There is no meritocracy in buying all the best players.

* The pyramid is dead. Reading from a j**e post, it is always the same clubs who win the national leagues. Again, as per point 2, there is no meritocracy.

Now. The ESL at least ""try"" to fix point 1, in a completely wrong way, by further reducing meritocracy. It could fix point 3 considering the level within the league atm is more balanced that what we have in the national league, but it does not fix the core of the problems, and even worse we might end up with a lot of disparities in the future within the ESL as well.

I think the core of the problem would be to introduce the only two things we would need from the NFL: 

* the salary cap, decided at a European level. Each team, no matter how rich their owner is, can allocate only N millions of Euro to their player salaries. You want to pay 30M for Ronaldo? Fine. Then you have less money for the rest. This would mean that for all the money an owner have, they cannot but ALL the stars. At that point management, good coaches, good growth from the youth team are key going forward.

* Better division of income. If the salary cap is introduced, we do not have teams that have absurd costs per year and need 50% of the income generated by the CL/National leagues. This could solve most of the issues small clubs have, and I think we would start to see more smaller teams in each league winning titles.

Without ESL, I don't think those two points will ever happens, mainly because the big clubs are absolutely greedy bastards, and therefore they do not want to share the pie or risk to lose it to smaller teams that are better managed. But I think they WILL be implemented in the future, once the ESL has destroyed all the national leagues, and at that point the owners will/can think about reducing costs to further enhance profit/stability of their own clubs, be damed all others smaller ones.",gv3poox,mtn63l,FCInterMilan,2021-04-20 01:14:10,seejur,3

"All of this is simply a mess. just to say, already in the 2018 with the platini scandal was found out about this super league and that UEFA paid some club like Milan, Juve, Real and Bayern to not create this super league (here the link, the article is in Italian: [https://www.lastampa.it/sport/2018/11/03/news/bomba-sul-calcio-l-uefa-avrebbe-pagato-i-club-piu-ricchi-per-evitare-la-nascita-di-una-superlega-1.34057379](https://www.lastampa.it/sport/2018/11/03/news/bomba-sul-calcio-l-uefa-avrebbe-pagato-i-club-piu-ricchi-per-evitare-la-nascita-di-una-superlega-1.34057379) )

And they did some big favor at city and psg too. So even the UEFA  management is not something perfect. Btw, the thing is, if they already knew this two years ago, and ok no one could forecast the covid, why didn't take some measures? I mean instead of vote this year to change the champions rules in 2024 why they didn't vote for this two years ago? Because at least with the new champions format there will be more game and so even the provide by tv rights will be higher. Or at least put some rule against that because I think that formerly in the rulebook of UEFA, it won't be written anywhere that they can't do this (but I admit that on this I'm a little ignorant on that). For who that are against this the lucky thing is that Bayern Monaco and PSG has said that they are against this so they wouldn't join in this because in the contrary for the UEFA if all the big club were agree on that it would have been a huge problem. Honestly the best punishment that we could expect, if we pulled back, could be some penalization for this and the next year and the exclusion by the champions for at least the next year.

PS: in case the society proceeded on this road there will be some technical problem:

A) the referees in general

B) We and Milan will be probably without a stadium, It his propriety of the comune of Milan so I don't know what kind of agree we have with it, but I don't think they will let us use it.

I can‚Äôt be mad to this team today, we didn‚Äôt play bad, and Napoli away is definitely top 3 hardest among all of the 38 fixtures. +9 still feels safe, considering that fucking Bilan is making points out of luck (that will eventually run out) and Rube is facing the fear of not being qualified for CL.

Surely Milan isn't going to win them all either, we can at least expect that between Lazio, Juve and Atalanta they'll drop SOME points, somewhere. A win for us would have basically sealed our title, but a draw isn't bad either.

Now, let's think about the match with Spezia: the last Milan team that underestimated them lost against them and completely turned around the title race.

Please Conte tell our players to shoot the goddamn ball when they have a decent chance though: both Darmian and Hakimi - our WBs - and even Lukaku were trying to pass it even in front of the goal.

Considering the recently announced CL format change, which will introduce even more matches to an already bloated fixture list, I can see why the clubs involved did what they did. More money, because who doesn't want to watch big clubs play each other consistently,and less matches and hence less strain on the players.

I don't entirely agree with the Super League, but let's not simply jump on the bandwagon here and criticizing this idea. You can say this is about money, but UEFA changing the CL format and including more teams, is similarly a purely financial move; more clubs, more matches, more money.

The UEL winner total prize pool (meaning from first to the last match) is ‚Ç¨10M, meaning up to the semifinal is a ginormous waste of money. Don't want to even think what the Conference League will be FFS.

Even beyond the points, we have real champions on our roster and a team who has bought into the system in a way we haven't seen since Jose.  The match today against Sassuolo was exactly the reason why we aren't going to blow it - playing without Brozovic against a tricky team is a recipe for danger and yet they were disciplined, stayed with their assignments, and for the vast majority of the match they limited Sassuolo to speculative chances at most.

Maybe Antonio wanted to play this streak of games like this and maybe brings something different next games.

And last but not least, I think that Hakimi should rest and sit on the bench Sunday, he's underperforming and technically he has to improve a lot. I hope he improves in the summer and I think Conte should treat him like he was treating him at the start of the season so he can find the motivation that he's lackin lately.",gtq4bbf,mm8sv7,FCInterMilan,2021-04-08 03:42:36,joehasthejuice,4

""They could get decent coach and build the team around Chiesa. But no, they still want to waste money on amateur coach and super expensive old player. Good for us""

""Let's hope CR7 stays too""

""If Allegri returns, Juventus will be much stronger. We want Pirlo to manage them as long as possible.""

""Thing is, if Allegri returns there might be an issue with Nedved/Paratici. Both personal and because it would represent the failure of their project.""

""The way they've managed the club since Marotta left should already have them on the hot seat.""

and finally

**Imo they don't have a project when they cluelessly sacked a great manager in Allegri, got a decent manager Sarri but sacked him only after a season, then brought in Pirlo without any prior experience.**

**Their luck has run out; works for us though.**

Can some of you become Juve fans please? The amount of idiots in that sub is unreal. Clueless. I've never had anything against Inter and it seems to me their fans are far more informed and knowledgeable these days. So many ronnie and dybala fanboys the Juve sub, it's hard to breathe.

"Honestly I don‚Äôt know why Inter chose Hakimi over Lautaro.

It‚Äôs so much harder to find a world class player at this position. He was scoring and assisting, very fundamental to our counterattacking style. He even won‚Äôt give us big capital gain seeing we just signed him last year.

On the other hand Lautaro would have been relatively easier to replace, and will record a significant capital gain for us. 

With this money (60) We are still 40 millions shy of our target. I can‚Äôt see how we are getting 40m with our deadwood. So It looks like we are selling another piece, not particularly a high valued one like Lautaro or Bastoni, but rather someone like Eriksen, Brozovic or even both. 

The good side about this tho, Inzaghi will get to work with the team without losing Hakimi along the way. He will have time to adapt our team on his departure.",gzskmvx,nn54mu,FCInterMilan,2021-05-29 03:19:30,UnsuppressedAnger,41

If he's the only big loss and we can play Darmian/Lazaro on the right, I would say we have a good shot at repeating.  I think other players we might sell, namely Lukaku and Brozovic, have a higher value to us than they do on the market due to how critical they are to our play style.",gzspm8q,nn54mu,FCInterMilan,2021-05-29 03:57:51,Fuzzydeath10,5

1 - Hakimi never really integrated into our plaly style. Dont get me wrong, he probably would have been much better last year, but there was no chemistry between him and Barella. The team actually seldomly provided him the situations where he thrills best - and often those would go to Lukaku rather than Hakimi

2 - Who would you rather sell instead of Hakimi? Barella? Bastoni? Lautaro? For me, none of those. If we have to sell a big name with actual demand, I'd rather Hakimi than maybe anyone but De Vrij (love him but he's getting older)

People gotta chill. In 2010 no one knew Allegri or Conte would become the next best Italian coaches. Inzaghi may very well be the next. He‚Äôs proven to at least be a decent manager.

"Is inzaghi really that bad of a choice? Of course, if there was a top manager in the market I'd want the club to go for them. But there isn't, so maybe a coach who is used to the Serie A and could adapt his tactics to this team relatively easily isn't that terrible.

He is used to a 3atb defense, and Lazio had one of the best defences in the league last season. He is used to playing with 2 strikers up top, one of which drops a bit deeper to play with the defence, and most likely will request for a good third striker. He is used to playing with a creative and talented midfield and productive wing backs.

Honestly, I'm extremely pissed at how all of this unfolded right after winning the league and I'm not happy that we have to downgrade managers, but I like that the club isn't trying to completely revolutionise the team and is still showing signs of ambition domestically and in Europe, as seen on the statement by the Curva Nord.

Inzaghi could be a transition manager that, if things go well, could retain the title, make some noise in Europe, and when his contract runs out, give his place to a top European manager that takes us back to the top, like Mancini did with Mourinho.

"My 2 cents on the current situation:

1 - Conte will join Real Madrid. He has known this for a while and this is the main reason why he decided to leave. I am sure that the idea of losing a big player and cutting expenses disappointed him, but the possibility of joining Real Madrid was anyway the main reason behind his move. Let's be serious: Inter could lose one of his important players (I am thinking Skriniar here), and offload some dead weight (Ninja, Vidal, Kolarov, Ranocchia) and still be the strongest team in Serie A next year. Conte might believe that the resulting roster would not be good enough to advance in UCL, but weaker teams advanced before and we have to acknowledge that we basically kick ourselves out of group stage before.

2 - Our management handled this situation horrendously. I don't have the financial knowledge to understand if a +80M profit is something realistically achievable for a title winning club in the covid market, so I am going to accept that as a fact. At the same time, you have to know your coach, and you have to know that there are some chances that he will resign if you ask him to cut expenses (again, chances turned into reality since he had an offer from Real Madrid on the table, imo). That being said, it is simply not possible that you don't have a plan B ready. That's an amateur move. Has the Allegri-Juve deal been closed a while ago and we had no chance of signing him? Fine. But then why weren't we ready to sign De Zerbi, Mourinho, S. Inzaghi, Sarri? 

3 - What the hell is the deal with this 7M payout fee? Do Real Madrid really want to sign a manager that is currently under contract with us? Fine, make them pay a fee. If they don't want to do it and prefer signing a different coach (Raul), let's see if Conte remains convinced that resigning without any compensation is still a good idea.

"I have to say, that while this is the worst bloody scenario possible, I M still kind of exited at the thought of having a new coach. Just, not a shitty one please, not fucking Fonseca or Miha. Sarri, even if completely different from Conte tactically speaking, is a manager that can win and makes their teams play exiting football (he just needs time, his first seasons ain‚Äôt as great as the last ones).  We have very good players and I M confident that our youngsters could really step up in the next years.

"This is an out of the box suggestion but Edin Terzic might be a decent choice if we can't land other top choices like Allegri or Sarri. With all due respect to Mihajlovic or Stankovic, both of whom have their own case to coach Inter, Terzic has had a long experience working under Klopp. He has also had experienced managing a huge club playing in Champions League albeit only for 6 months, which I think gives him an edge over Miha and Stankovic. He did a great job turning Dortmund's season around and I believe we can benefit from playing German-style football which seems to be reigning supreme in European football today.

He's also not afraid of utilizing youth players and it's about time we take advantage of our primavera that has historically provided decent players of Serie A level (think Zaniolo, Di Marco, Faraoni, Biraghi, etc).

"I rate Inzaghi for the work he's done with Lazio but let's be honest. He is not an elite coach, he would be a downgrade of we go for him now after winning that elusive title after 11 years and wishing to establish as a big club again in Europe. He's a risk, unknown element on how to handle a club with big ambition and players. When we had the likes of Pioli or Spalletti likes, getting Inzaghi would have been less risky appointment if not an upgrade. Not now after Conte, 2 years of a project continuing winning streak and trying to prove ourselves. 

The only damage control Suning can do is to attract big name players like Zidane, Alegri or even Simeone however unlikely that sounds.

Inzaghi or any of similar level won't cut it.

"""I always ended up at clubs who were running an austerity programme.""

It's the history of Don Conte. 

I'm a Chelsea fan but I've thoroughly enjoyed watching Inter, the last two seasons - watching the whole team grow and players develop. The warrior that is Barella. Bastoni starting to take charge in defence. And ofcourse Toro and Kaku! What a beautiful team that had been built and all for nothing. Freakin virus, man! I was so looking forward to see Inter dominate Serie A for the years to come. What a tragic end to such a beautiful journey!

Two managers I love and both ended up at Inter after their Chelsea stint, and both times ended their stint with stupendous success, and making me attached to the Blue and Black!

Hope you (and an honorary we, if I may) get someone who can carry forward this momentum. Forza Inter!

Sinisa or Simeone could be worth it, the latter is 100% a pipe dream and for the former I can't help but wonder how his health factors into the pressure of managing a top of league team.

Realistically if Conte leaves I don't expect our next year to amount to much, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong. With all due respect to Inzaghi he's not the type of winning coach we need for a good CL campaign.",gzi58r0,nld4vl,FCInterMilan,2021-05-26 19:59:31,ristoman,1

"Eriksen is not suited for his current position. These last few games we have seen subpar performances from him as a box to box midfielder. He is an upgrade from Gagliardini for sure, but he is far from playing his best at the position. One of the reason why is his natural positioning. He played as an AM his whole career, so he is not used to falling deep and opening himself to receive building passes from the back line. He positioned himself often behind an opposing player waiting for through passes, which is more of an attacking play. As a result the ball lingers on the back three far too often, hindering the flow forward. We even see Bastoni push forward more and more frequently because of this. This is not totally Eriksen's fault since the mezzala position is a tough one to get settled in to. I think Eriksen is more suited as a deep lying playmaker (Brozovic's position). That way there will be less confusion in his positioning and he can deliver long balls forward from behind.

"I get that:

1) We‚Äôre already Campioni and it‚Äôs more than understandable that our players weren‚Äôt at their 100% both mentally and physically for this game;

2) Milan and Napoli don‚Äôt have to blame us for losing this game but just themselves if they don‚Äôt win _their_ games; 

3) The referee was shit and that Cuadrado penalty (that I even missed) was literally ‚Äúmaterialized‚Äù out of nowhere.

But we just can‚Äôt play an entire first half like we did against a team like rube. I mean, RUBE. A game against ladri will never be an unimportant event for us fans. Not even if our season is over. 

I know that the guys have already given us one of the greatest things of this 2021 (personally speaking the Scudetto win is the happiest thing happened in my year so far) but I expected a completely different attitude from many players. I was confident in our squad that we would‚Äôve managed to win this game way earlier (because we‚Äôve had the opportunity to do so) but we let the 12th rube player, ehm, I mean, mr. referee, decide rube‚Äôs fate once again. 

And now because of this I feel worse than after the UEL final last year. Losing this way hits harder than anything else, even if the game doesn‚Äôt affect you at all.

I don't even agree with Bentancur's second yellow but damn, Inter was done dirty in this match and this referee fucked up HARD countless times.

Chiellini jumping around like a fucking monkey when Darmian's hand grazes him is not a foul. Chiellini yanking at Lautaro's shirt while the handball call was in debate and Lautaro is through on goal should have resulted in a card. Cuadrado literally throwing himself into Perisic while inside the box in the closing minutes is not a foul.

That decision completely ruined any and all momentum for us and this schmuck of a referee didn't even review it.

---

Edit: Fuck it, I wrote this on another reply, but since I'm reading WAY too much ""but ref was awful for both teams!"", here's the ""big points"". How anyone can say he made actual mistakes to give us an advantage, I don't know. Starting with mistakes that advantaged Juve:

* Penalty on Chiellini - if that's a pen, then every single contact to ever happen on a corner kick is a penalty. Chiellini literally hugged and held Lukaku on our corner kick a few minutes earlier, is that a pen too then?

* Missing 2nd yellow on De Ligt - near the end of the match, Lautaro got booked for a foul on De Ligt, literally the same one De Ligt gave away a penalty with. And yet, De Ligt didn't get his second yellow.

* Missing 2nd yellow on Kulusevski - the guy just kept fouling and fouling the first half. This one isn't as egregious as the other points though, just thought it would be good to mention.

* Goal taken away from Lautaro - even on Sky they were a little unsure on what to say, that goal should have stood since Lukaku doesn't do shit, it's as usual Chiellini pretending to be fouled.

* Ridiculous VAR check on our 2nd goal - Chiellini screamed and complained, therefore this must not be a goal. Today Calvarese was literally slave to Juve's screaming and bitching, he had to even go and check what should have been a clear, obvious goal. At least he gave it.

* Disgusting penalty given to Juve at the end - the worst decision in the entire match, Cuadrado literally opens his arms and kicks at random hoping to touch Perisic. Cuadrado kicks Perisic, not the opposite, and yet the penalty is given to Juve. VAR disappears for such a big decision.

The two events that you could say went to our advantage are:

* Penalty on Lautaro? I don't know, some people are spinning this as ""ref compensated for the previous pen"", but this one is a clear one. He gets his heel kicked, literally the same foul Lautaro does on De Ligt much later on (and gets booked for). Clear pen.

* Second yellow to Bentancur - this one is probably the most discussed one as ""it went to Inter's advantage"", but that was basically a tactical foul. Mix that with his complaining and all the fouls Bentancur had been committing, and I don't see why that shouldn't be a second yellow? Like, is it THAT crazy?

That's it. This is already being spun as ""ref went against both teams"", but it's simply ridiculous to say so when those were the big mistakes. And even then, the two points I wrote for Inter weren't mistakes at all.",gy8km6p,nd4loy,FCInterMilan,2021-05-16 01:58:20,5kyLegend,10

"We're playing bad, but the tactics are spot on. Juve are hard pressing in our half while man-marking our key outlets (Brozovic, Hakimi, Lukaku). 

Conte prepared for this and planned to set up his team around quick transitions, risky progressive passing and long balls over the top. A lot of what isn't working right now comes down to the players not being able to execute short passing sequences while under pressure and just general lack of rhythm in their counter-attacking play. We need consistency. 

However, Conte did get some things wrong. He didn't plan for the heavy man-marking strategy, and we're seeing how stifled we are when we attempt to direct the ball to Lukaku. Chiellini has been shutting that option down. We're also very uncomfortable in possession. Conte needs to sort out how to maintain composure and tame the initial high press that Juve are maxing out on. 

We do have some advantages though. Juve will run out of steam and will need to give up the high press and also will need to settle for defensive solidity in the second half. With the right tactical changes and substitutions (bring on Perisic), we could gain control of the match.",gy8e1di,nd0rvr,FCInterMilan,2021-05-16 01:05:46,young_gam,2

"Roma is such a dirty team. No stakes, yet they spent the whole match fouling us left and right, injuring Sanchez without any need for it. There could have been at least two reds, and many yellows weren't given. I always try and give them the benefit of the doubt, yet they ALWAYS end up playing like this.

I'm glad for the win though, we broke the curse of drawing against them. I'm not worried about the ""Conte-Lautaro drama"", it's the usual sort of thing that happens during a heated match, it's not like the two are going to now hate each other lol

Now, if we beat Juve, they're out of the Champions League. I hope we can pull out a convincing performance against them. I'm happy that we managed these two last wins even if we weren't at 100%",gxwevw1,nayv9d,FCInterMilan,2021-05-13 04:50:10,5kyLegend,19

"Inter fan since I was born, almost 31 years and counting. As I was born in 1990 I missed the scudetto of 89 and growing up I had to endure friends telling me how many years since we won a trophy.  We all know our late 2000s run and the tripletta win...and its been another 11 years since. And this is possibly the sweetest scudetto victory I've lived. No more ""after calciopoli there was no competition left"" and I cant give a damn about what the Rube Bilan fans say...however this year it was a stiff competition. Forget how it ended and how we dominated in the second half of the season. Juve was still Juve and just spent 150M in Covid summer + Penaldo and bla bla, Bilan turned out to overachieve and actually become a proper team, Atalanta fierce as ever...and people are forgetting about Napoli. They arguably got a lot stronger the past two seasons and have a very deep and valid squad. And yet we came out on top and rolling over all of them.   


Celebrations were with my girlfriend in our town (close to Milan) who had to endure watching all the games with me and being ok with me having my other love üòÄ. For my 2019 birthday she gifted me the chance to go watch either a derby of Milan or derby of Italy at San Siro for the upcoming season. And then Covid happened and we are still waiting for the chance. Hopefully, it can happen next season so I get to see Inter playing wearing the scudetto badge and going for the repeat!!   


Pazza Inter amala!!! sempre!",gy0m8fk,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-14 03:48:40,Jasonmilo911,1
"First of all, Forza Inter!  
Secondly, thanks for making this contest, so that  I got a place to share my story with Inter this far.  
I am from Indonesia. It is very far from Italy.  The time difference is 6 hours in summertime. This means I need to wake up or stay up until 2 AM to watch Inter.  
Just like anyone in my age, we start our love for Inter from the one and only, Ronaldo, the original one. I can remember when it exactly, but I remember I cheer for him at World Cup 1998. Where Ronaldo loses in the final.  
After that, I was so sad when we lose the scudetto on the final day, versus Lazio. I still remember the name, Vratislav Gre≈°ko. God knows, how I hate him until now. If you remember Filipo in 2012, a kid who begs for Inter's win because he got mocked by his friend at school. That's me. I got mocked a lot. My friends are mostly Juve or Milan fans. Too bad, Indonesia is very far from Italy.  
Another unlucky, losing to Milan in Champions League semifinal by away goal (although we played in the same stadium!).  
Before the Calciopoli, I actually enjoy the name who comes to Inter. From Toldo, Vieri, Recobba, Martins, Almeyda, Kily Gonzales, Crespo, Cannavaro, Sergio Conceciao, Adriano, Julio Cruz, van der Meyde, Emre, Cambiasso, and so on.  
Then comes Calciopoli. It changes the tide. We are winning easily. I enjoy the scudetto of course, but still not too proud. We don't have any strong rivals at this time. Ibra and Adriano were too strong.  
It was an easy period. Although, I don't buy why we trade Ibra with Eto'o then buy Milito and Motta. Oh boy, I was so wrong. They are so great!.  
The treble.  
When I heard the news that the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano erupts that force Barcelona to go to Milan by bus, I was so sure that we will win the first leg. And we did. The 2nd leg was very bad for my heart. I can't remember how many times I close my eyes when Barca attacks us. In the end, we show that we have the best defense in the world and we beat the best attacking team at that time. The rest is history, we won the treble. It was one of the best days of my life.  
Then the dark era is started.  
A little story, Inter visit Indonesia in 2012. Of course, I go to watch the match. This is my first time watching football in a stadium actually (I was so introverted and watching football in Indonesia is quite risky). Finally, I can see Zanetti who gets my respect more and more.  
The dark era is continued.  
It's even worse than the pre-Calciopoli era. I don't want to remember what's happening and which players we bought since we are the suck. Even worse, our promising players like Alvarez, Coutinho, Gabigol, or Kovacic are sold or underperformed in Inter. We have this random Rocchi, Rolando, Jonathan, Schelotto, Vidic, and other players. It was really sad. Of course, we still have a good player like Handanovic, Palacio, Miranda, Perisic, Brozo, but that's not enough.  
Icardi is good, but lately, he got so annoying. Thanks, PSG for buying him.  
Oh, by the way, I randomly got a lucky chance to visit Milan and the stadium in 2017!. Unfortunately, there was no Inter's home match at that time. Thankfully, I managed to watch Roma vs Lazio! I saw Nainggolan's goal!. My first impression, coming to the stadium without a match is not really satisfying. I only see the grass being cared for.  
Season 2018/2019 is actually a starting point for me to see the hope of Inter. I think it was Spaletti who started it, and Conte is continuing it.  
Thanks to the players, we are starting to have a really solid squad. De Vrij for free is really a big help for us. The Lautaro is coming, I am afraid he will be like Gabigol, but thankfully, he is not.  
I was not so sure with Big Rom. I don't really like how he plays in MU. Just like I was not so sure with Milito. But I was wrong, he is the player we need, besides Hakimi. For Hakimi, I was so sure he will be a great addition. He is the first player I bought on my Football Manager 2020.  
Season 2019/2020 is getting exciting. Unexpected Europe League final, although we lose. But we are getting there. We got Bastoni, Eriksen, Barella and Sensi. Vecino and 5gag are also having a spotlight also. Although the coming of MU's players are the least of what I want. They are not young (Alexis, Young, Darmian). But, I was again, wrong. Darmian is our savior lately, Young is giving his good service for Lukaku, and Alexis is explosive when Lautaro is silent.  
Season 2020/2021. Few bad results at the beginning of the season and knocked from UCL's group. But Inter's getting stronger and consistent. And finally, we won the scudetto!  
This is much sweeter than the Calciopoli era for me, why?  
1. After a longer banter era  
2. With so many random transfer  
3. The rivals are not weak actually, we got Ronaldo and Ibra  
4. The squad is more harmonize (probably because InterMedia is doing a great job).  
So, thanks to Conte for bringing the scudetto for us!  
A special mention for my favorites players: Lukaku, Lautaro, Barella, Hakimi, and Bastoni. I want them to stay at any cost!  
I hope we can do better and better next year! Forza Inter!  
Some extra banters:

1. I  hate Green Barca (Sassuolo). After we beat them 7-0, we always get a problem with them  
2. Chievo is also hard to beat, especially after the first time they promote to Serie A (remember the number 10 goalkeeper and marazina). I remember we got a draw 3-3 (almost lose actually). But respect to them  
3. Bale, what a sprint  
4. Arsenal, we beat them 3-0 in London, but lose when we play in Milan

"This time I'm happier for my little brother than for me. 

I've been Interista since 97' and I had my fair share of titles, tripleta, derby wins, fantastic players, interesting transfer markets etc. but he was too young when we last won the title and tripleta and he became Interista because of me some time around 2012/13. So year after year I felt very bad that he's growing up in a banter era, and finally this year we could celebrate Inter together, it's his first trophy and I'm so happy.

"forza inter!

I am an American Serb who began to support Inter after seeing Croatia's dark horse run in the 2018 world cup. Seeing Ivan, Brozo, and Sime light up the field made me so proud to be a Yugoslav! It is what made me become a calcio fan as a whole instead of just watching world cups and playing in my free time. Now i am a huge fan of the sport thanks to that Croatian national team which had many nerazzuri on it :)

it is also a part of my motivation to learning italian as my language choice for school, so it enabled me to have extra motivation through all the passato prossimo and whatnot. 

When we won, I was euphoric. The pain from the final last year was instantly wiped away. No one could contest now that WE are the representatives of Italy. This is our league now, the others have to kill us to take it from us!

"I waited for so long for this Scudetto, and when we won my whole school life flashed through my eyes (from elementary to high school).  The days in class when we won a derby with a goal at the last second, the day when we conceded the derby's draw at 97th minute, the clashes after Pjanic's never-given-second-yellow for the foul on Rafinha, the first win in their stadium with Stramaccioni after being scored in 25 seconds (Vidal, in offisde, on Asamoah's pass).

I was one of the few Nerazzurri in class, and the other ones were quite peaceful; so I nearly always had a fight during my school lifetime, like every monday morning, for some reason, and it was fine this way, and if there weren't reasons, we threw something on the table bringing back ""that penalty that you \[juve or milan\] robbed from \[insert random team\] last week"".  And if I wanted to spectate to the other two teams quarrel, I made sure to bring back Muntari's goal before bringing in my popcorns.  Now the drama is quite over, with the VAR we surely have much easier times (not at all, since some mistakes are still there) but for sure it's a fairer competition.

I was sure that the first year with VAR we could manage to win the Scudetto, but *their* advantage was simply too huge to fill the gap in just one year.

With a couple of quality seasons, both on the coach's (Spalletti, and now Conte) and players' level, we managed to get back on track and fill down the gap and finally get the overtake in this season's Standing.  Now we are the owners of our destiny, we need to continue moving towards the right direction and I would like to say that we could be able to put up a Scudetto streak if we do not do big mistakes.  We are the strongest team in the League, so it is only up to us!  Come on guys!!",gxu0amh,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-12 17:01:51,crostinibistrattati,1

"Due to being interista since 96 I have seen highs and lows, due to the love for the team I still watched every game I could. Since I am now in Zambia and apparently people here only support Chelsea or other PL teams (tho I saw someone with rubentus jersey) I just celebrated by myself with a bottle of wine. This Scudetto means a lot, because it has been 10 years, at one point I doubted mr. Conte but I couldn't be happier he proved haters wrong. When he feels like this and squad believes in him, he is top 3 HC in the world imo.

I only wish i could have been in Italy for celebrations.

"I started supporting Inter on a random night of 1994, when I had accidentally turned the TV on and watched Nicola Berti score against Salzburg in the final of UEFA cup; I was 6, I didn't even know what football was. That night I decided it had to be Inter.

If you think the last decade was difficult you haven't lived through the '90s: years of almost relegations, eliminations in the first rounds, Iuliano fouling Ronaldo in the penalty box when the scudetto was almost secured, Lazio winning 4-2 on May the 5th when I had bought myself a kit to celebrate a victory that eventually didn't happen. But being an Interista means that every win is a real win, because they don't come cheap, because we always make it hard for ourselves.

I was on top of the world when we won the Triplete, I saw this team becoming the strongest in the world, I saw it decline thereafter, and now win again. I am looking back at that night of more than 25 years ago and now more than ever let's enjoy this Scudetto, we are the champions and nobody is taking this away.",gxhazvc,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 17:02:06,evergreengt,1
"Been an Inter fan since the late '80s, where I live I'm surrounded by Gobbi, except for two friends of mine. During the previous 9 years in May all around was white and black flags with lots of banter lines and man these guys are annoying, most of the time they don't even watch the games and they just appear when they get a trophy.

This year we're in May and no Juve flags, best year of the decade. Going to meet with my two friends next week to celebrate and banter out some gobbi plastics.

Big memory for me is that I always liked the GK role so in the early 90s I was a Walter Zenga fan, he advertise lots of SEGA products and one of them was the Sega Megadrive (Genesis) which I eventually purchased... Still a gamer today.",gxfnuou,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 06:29:24,Sgruntlar,1
"I was genuinely so surprised that we actually managed to win, not that it was surprising in itself because we had a great season, but it still felt so unreal seeing us celebrating and calling ourselves champions of Italy! it‚Äôs been a huge emotion, this season was wild and great, started out difficult and turned out amazing. so of course me and my interisti friends got brozo level drunk",gxh1kot,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 14:37:28,benzipol,1
"I am privileged because I live in Milan. These days are so exciting, I‚Äôm living on euphoria.. feels like a throwback of 2010, really. Haven‚Äôt gone outside on Sunday (too many people), so I stayed at home and celebrated watching the live stream and drinking with my SO. 

Yesterday, though, I went to San Siro, things were better organized and there was more room for comfort. Chanted a little with Curva guys and cheered the bus along when the squad arrived to the stadium.

"I swear that last part ruined my mood a little bit,just imagine if all of this is just a dream and tmrr i see kuzmanovic again ............thanks for the nightmares mods.
Means a lot ,i barely have any interisti friends IRL ,and tbh quite annoyed by juventini always acting so high and keept saying ""you guys are stuck in 2010,its in the past"".Now its amazing and funny because whenever i talk with them its ""we have 9 in a row"" and my answer is ""u r stuck in past bruh ,its 2021 ;)"" .I hope we win vs them.About milansti keep telling all of them , they cant keep up this pace they will not even make it to CL,and this was back in November/December,and maybe i was wrong ,but between them and juve,i would rather milan make it cuz if juve doesnt they might collapse economically.
Banter era? Hmmmm,yelling,insulting swearing i wont see them again,waking up tmrr saying its ok it will get better,its my team i have to support no matter what,getting my hopes up ,and then next week going to the bar again to watch them yelling insulting swearing u get the point right? ;)
Point is no matter what u cant stop supporting inter,i still remember crying when milito scored that 2nd gol,i think its just one of the few times in my life i have cried,so even if we end up relegating ,u cant erase all the emotions this shirt gave you.I hope i can relive it once more in my life.",gxh7vuc,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 16:12:21,ElviS_Pa,1

"What can I say that can truly capture the anguish it is to see a proud and mighty club slip into a purgatory of self loathing.

Indeed, life a an Inter supporter is not for the faint hearted. As is life in general if you think about it for the majority. 

Things, achievements are chipped away like a classic renaissance sculpture to reveal the beauty that was hiding in that lump of rock. At the end, covered in dust, blisters. You can stand back and take a deserved sigh of relief.

As a club and fan base over the last 11 years we have experienced incredible changes, tribulations. Changes in ownership, players, level of competition.

Depending on when you started following the club, one thing is guaranteed. It‚Äôs going to be a rollercoaster of emotions, a continuous test of your resolve and loyalty.

Fratelli del Mundo. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. This is a microcosm of a world we want. United for a common goal disregarding background creed or sex. We will suffer together and we will celebrate together.

Inter does not pretend to be perfect. It‚Äôs a work in progress. To grow, to learn, to teach the thieves that they cannot hide forever, because there is a sweaty dusty army of Nerazzurri who will never stop!

The only kit I have is from 2013/2014 and it reminds me of Jonny il Divino &amp; the gang. Not cool.

I‚Äôm grateful for Inter for giving me such positive memories in an otherwise dark period of time.

I learned to be patient. Like many of you I had a lot of problems with Conte and his ‚Äúpercorso‚Äù but I was proved completely wrong. I‚Äôve grown up with Inter winning most of the time so I never truly realized how much it truly takes to be a champion, from the players to the coach to the management.

"I¬¥ve lived in loads of different countries in my lifetime and thus making many friends from different countries that support different clubs. So you could imagine the amount of shit and banter I¬¥ve received over the last decade lmaoo, wasn¬¥t very used to it I admit, then I almost forgot what winning tastes like and was ready to get this for a looong time. The troll I¬¥ve received from my juventini friends is unmatched so I¬¥ll be returning them a favour for sure. I was confident at the start of the season and made a shitton of bets with a lot of different people so I¬¥m enjoying their misery right now hahaha. In fact, I haven¬¥t seen this juventino friend of mine  for a long time, he¬¥s got a birthday coming soon so I¬¥m planning a surprise visit and bet I¬¥ll be surprising him with a custom cake. I¬¥m thinking either something like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDtK5wkUsAEWtKQ?format=jpg&amp;name=medium) (without that clubs badge obvs) or if Milan bottles it, something like this [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E001dF7WYAIh4rd?format=jpg&amp;name=large) (I love [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRo_V7fUAAAJfok?format=jpg&amp;name=small) too). Or maybe even an Inter kit with Rube on the back, I¬¥ll see haha. One thing¬¥s for sure, I¬¥m not gonna go easy lmaoo, I¬¥ve suffered too much.

It¬¥s also great because this Scudetto title represents a new start for me personally too, I feel like I¬¥ve become more myself and discovered who I actually a (I was a lil late to that lol). I¬¥ve never quite felt this positive about life as a whole and this scudetto perfectly represents that. All in all, this looks to be one of the better summers coming and I¬¥ll rep as much Inter as I possibly can everywhere I go. Just wanted to get that out too

Great stuff mods, this sub has been growing in quantity and in quality recently and you¬¥ve all been doing great great work, I love the amount of stuff you all do to keep everyone engaged even if it is a small community right now, and I really mean this, not to be an ass licker.

"Being a fan since 2014 I've endured joy, pain mentally and physically. But I stood proud knowing my team will grow like a flower and bloom to what it is today. We all trusted the process and pushed for this moment we're in. We finally beat the boss we struggled to beat for years. I also started playing football in 2014 so Inter was my only team I followed, what can I say I love black and blue. It's funny cause all these months my Juventino friend said ""Inter will choke like always."" I said ""yea sure man just watch."" And guess what he never said anything cause we never choked. Now I rub it in his face and tell him don't worry you guys won't win next year it's gonna be us again. Planning to get a Inter tattoo on my leg I got ACL surgery on in February as memory.

I enjoyed the ""triplete"" so much that I bought myself a Cuchu Cambiasso shirt (he used to play in Independiente, my local club) that I loved and used every sunday to play football with my friends. Since then I followed Inter and fight to death with a friend of mine who is a Rube fan lol.

"I actually started supporting Inter after the triplete season back in 2010. Most people from southeast asia support english teams but not me. I fell in love with the idea that Inter were the ‚Äúbrothers of the world‚Äù team unlike other teams that seem to label fans outside of their native country as plastics. 

However, we all know what happened the next decade. Enduring the 10 year wait without a trophy was torture, while other teams were on the rise. But, i stayed loyal to the nerazzuri when other people told me to support other teams.

The highlight of my life since being a fan was when I got the chance to visit [Milan](https://imgur.com/gallery/BaPquCj) and the [Giuseppe Meazza stadium](https://imgur.com/gallery/uAp3KK1). It was colossal and I had a literal chill down my spine when i stepped out from the underground metro.

"I've basically been extremely active on this sub this last year, almost all my posts on Reddit have been on /r/FCInterMilan, I was a little crushed inside after our defeat in the EL Final last year... But I knew this year was going to be special. The anxiety of waiting for every match, the initial disappointments after our repeated draws and the elimination from the CL, and then... The pure magic that happened the second half of the season. Finally we're back to where we belong, and we're back to feeling the emotion that winning a major trophy brings, and I couldn't be any happier. In 2010 I remember all those emotions, feeling how actually dying is like when Barcelona scored a second goal, only for it to be overturned, screaming my heart out after beating Bayern... And then, the minor celebrations for the Coppa Italia next year. After that, nothing for 10 years.

As for myself, I immediately went out and got the Gazzetta as had always been tradition back when we won titles, and the next day I got their book on our win (which is pretty damn nice, I love physical books with full color photos and summaries of how we got this far). [Here they are, I think they look beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/mujVZA4.jpg).

But... Well, even more importantly, since this is a thread about personal stuff and all, I also wanted to get something for my dad, since it's his birthday exactly today (was kinda hoping we'd win the scudetto on this very Sunday, but I guess I can't complain ahahah). He's been the one who made me the Interista I am today, he taught me everything about Inter when I was little, telling me stories about our big matches, about how he cried when Ronaldo il Fenomeno got his career-changing injury, about Juve and why everyone hates them. And, even though he's getting older, he watched every single match with me this season, he was always by my side, celebrating every goal and suffering through every match. So, I decided I wanted to thank him for making me the way I am, for teaching me how important, how special Inter is.

Which is why I decided to surprise him by getting him the Treble Captain armband from Zanetti's restaurant ""El Botinero"", signed by Il Capitano himself, complete with my father's name written on it. This was probably the most special and heartfelt gift I had for him in a while, and I guess it was really effective (especially because of how we just won our title) since he broke in tears the moment he realized what the gift he was opening was. [This is how the armband looks like](https://i.imgur.com/hvlzUPp.jpg), and [this is the autograph on the back](https://i.imgur.com/xg0P9X7.jpg) (I'm censoring my father's name for obvious reasons). I'm glad he enjoyed it so much, and I hope we'll celebrate more and more Inter wins together in the coming years.

So yeah, this has been one hell of a special week, and I couldn't be any more overjoyed. I also want to thank the mods (and /u/Tranceh) for their generosity with these initiatives, it's an amazing way to collect this type of stories, and to celebrate a title win. Thank you again, everyone, and I wish everyone good luck with this contest! Forza Inter, ***SEMPRE***!",gxht17q,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 21:14:38,5kyLegend,1
"My support for Inter dates back to the date of my birth.

Being born and raised in Italy but at 400+km from Milan gave me some hard times in watching matches live at the stadium.

After I graduated, I received a job offering from a society based in Milan and then I combined business with pleasure.  I managed to get a stadium subscription in a really cool stadium sector and I finally enjoyed nearly two full seasons live, on Home matches.

Unluckily after I was season ticket holder for two seasons, the Scudetto season was the one when no supporters are allowed to the Stadium but I'm pretty sure next year we will able to join other supporters and fulfill back the stadiums like more than a year ago.  On the treble season I was a step away from being 18 so this is my very first title as an adult, and being able to celebrate it under the Duomo has being astonishing.

&amp;#x200B;

This short tale just to state that I'm really happy and proud of this community.  The Fantasy League and this contest+lottery are great ways to give the opportunity to everybody to win Inter's merchandising, and both the admins and u/Tranceh are doing this by their hearts, even if they could ask the whole community something in return.  So just to let all Inter redditors notice this: please, be grateful and bear in mind the luck you have been awarded with (other that supporting Inter, of course, that's the ultimate blessing :D ).

&amp;#x200B;

Next year's home kit with the Scudetto patch will be a 'must have' but I will buy it even if I won't win this contest+lottery, because I'm pretty sure there are people that deserve to win this way more than me and because winning is not ""the only thing that matters"".  The thing that matters the most, and it is not the only one, is the Team, its values and us: its supporters.

&amp;#x200B;

"Honestly I would say that before the Scudetto celebrations I wasn't feeling as excited about this season as I though I'd be. In the last few years I'd been a ticket season holder so I wasn't able to feel the same atmosphere I was used to. We waited for so long this kind of success and I almost felt guilty not being extremely hyped about it.

Anyway, once Sassuolo-Atalanta ended I gathered a small group of friends and we headed to Milan to celebrate, we knew it would be dangerous covid-wise but you never know how long we could wait before another title lol.

I was kinda disapponted when we first arrived in Piazza Duomo, but once we arrived near the Castello Sforzesco we found where the [real party was at](https://imgur.com/a/aygZmf6)! It was actually really liberating to sing along with thousands of Interisti after so long. A feeling I'm looking forward to share with all the fans again in the San Siro, as soon as possible.

I hope we'll be able to keep this streak going because as great as this season has been I don't wanna settle. Sempre Forza Inter!",gxpqhhg,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-11 18:50:00,Masca77,1
"Hi there,

thanks for organizing this, it's a great way to know the community and celebrate the scudetto.

I used to love Inter until 2010, then we won the Triplete and I realized that was probably the peak of our history, that's why I preferred to stop following football altogether and dedicate more time to my second biggest passion: cinema.

Therefore, I cannot give my contribution as others did, but I can tell you something about a bunch of movies that I liked. Accidentally, these are also the ones that won the Oscar for Best Picture during the last decade.

*****

2011: **The Artist**

A silent movie, something you would never expect in 2011. I mean, it would be like witnessing Benitez, a nemesis of Mourinho, or even worse, a milanista like Leonardo, winning trophies on the Inter bench. Unconceivable.

2012: **Argo**

I loved this one. This is the story of a bunch of innocent co-workers that somehow find themselves prisoners of an evil boss named Ayatollah Ghaspereini. But they have a brilliant idea: they start performing so badly (I mean, imagine football players that keep pretending not to know how to play) that Ghaspereini is forced to leave, even if that doesn't stop him from shouting his useless fatwas (proclamations) against the brave men during the following decade.

2013: **12 years a slave**

Heart-breaking. It's a movie about a young football coach who somehow manages to win an important Youth Trophy at the very beginning of his career. For the following 12 years he is always linked to that moment, even if he would not win anything more. I mean, it might be more than 12 years, I stopped watching.

2014: **Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)**

OMFG, this one sucks. Just take a look at the [cast](https://imgur.com/a/tnDchNg.jpeg) and you realize you would never watch anything like this. I mean, there are also some legendary actors, but what about the rest? Seriously, don't watch this, and if you did, try to forget it.


2015: **Spotlight**

The plot is very simple: two men want to be in the spotlight, and they fight about it. One is a wannabe DJ (iirc his name is Osvaldo) while the other one (sorry I can't remember his name) wants to become an actor. Osvaldo loses, so No-name (or...yeah I guess it was something like Wando or similar) gets to be in the spotlight. At least for a while.

2016: **Moonlight**

Racism and LGBT themes together in a fantastic story. Two drug dealers (Kdog and FMelo) grow up in the streets of Appiano. Life is hard, but they somehow find a way to be together (on the bench).

2017: **The shape of water**

What is the shape of water? No one knows. It depends on the container. I don't know how to explain it to you, but since we are in this subreddit, I will try to use a football metaphor: we could say that a team has the shape the coach wants to give it. But what if in a single season you have three different coaches? Exactly, endless shapes. Ah, important, we are not talking about the old, unoriginal, boring, still water. This is sparkling water. Similar to when your team invests millions in a promising Brazilian start. Sparkling, wow.

2018: **Green Book**

The story of the infamous Green Book, which listed the football clubs allowed to take part in the most prestigious European competition, segregating the other ones, no matter how talented. Luckily, this barbarity is ended by a brave Uruguayan immigrant named Laprende Vecino. I have watched the final scene countless times on YouTube.

2019: **Parasite**

A sequel to Spotlight. Wando is crowned King of the spotlight, but he clearly doesn't know what to do. In an attempt to show what a great actor he is, he pretends to suffer from a knee injury. No one believes him and he gets fired.

2020: **Nomadland**

After losing his hair (well, he gets them back eventually, and that is a plot hole hard to forget), a middle-aged man also loses his dream job at the company he has always worked for. This forces him to travel around the continent. He finally finds his place at the rival company, where he meets a bunch of crazy people. The first thing he tells them is ""no more crazy"", to which they promptly reply ""s√¨, STOCAZZO"". Believe me, it's a movie that will grow on you, like hair.

Anyhow, I think I still need to answer your question. How did I celebrate the scudetto? Nothing special, some popcorn and a good movie.",gytp7xy,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-20 22:14:46,achille_sauro,1
"Only 45 minutes left in the last game of the season and I think this is the best scudetto I remember. I was too young for the 89, the first of 5 was not really celebrated only rightfully given to us, the others without much competition, the last one important but not as much as the CL.

Today feels better, feels like we fought harder.  This summer mercato will tell us if this is just the first. 

And next year we will reach the stars",gz5tv8m,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-23 22:01:46,drstins_n,1
"It's been a long way coming, but that makes it oh so sweet! I celebrated with a hearty meal and ordering a Lukaku jersey lol. 

I survived the banter era mostly by trying to find silver linings, especially these three or four years when the last matchday had generally gone in our way (Lord D'Ambrossio!)

Anyway, I'm just so relieved and happy that so many of our guys got their first trophy. Forza Inter!",gxh8eym,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 16:20:49,NobiLi-ty,1
"I come from a country in Europe where our clubs and national team almost never take part in any major competitions so naturally I started following the teams that took part in european club competitions. As a child I thought the uefa cup final was the most prestigious of them all, can't explain why. So in 1997 i was really hyped for Inter-Schalke final and I started to root for the team that had the same colors as my hometown. I really liked this Zamorano guy and that Zanetti dude but I couldn't watch the whole match because my parents sent me to bed. Few months later my brother told me that Ronaldo joined Inter and that's when I started following the team like a mad man. The 98 uefa cup final is still one of the most cathartic feelings I remember (the other is the CL of course), Zanetti with that amazing goal, Ronaldo and Zamorano scoring... how can anyone not like this team?

Anyway I'm older and wiser now, fuck rube for doping players in the 90's and paying refs, fuck bbilan because they're our bitchez. We are the champs, suck my nuts.",gyb129d,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-16 16:54:08,sznick,1
"I was in Las Vegas when we won the triplete... one of the best days of my life

Since then, at the beginning of every single season I used to tell myself: ""this is the season we are going to get to the top 4 and back to glory""

Watched Guarin's failed backpass to Handanovic be intercepted causing us to lose to bottom half teams... 

Watched Schelloto make crosses to no-man's-land, while fixing his hair mid-cross (sorta like Candreva)

Got extremely excited when we signed Gabigol that I was going to buy his jersey before the season started... thankfully I saved my money that year

Rodridgo Palacio was the only player I felt positive about during the banter era.. 

&amp;#x200B;

The list is endless.. but it's freakin over.. we are champions...

I wore my Inter jacket for 3 days straight anywhere I went, including to Costco... 

My Juve ""friends"" cringed and called me to congratulate me :) -- that felt nice.. a good change... hopefully for years to come",gyymqz8,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-22 00:52:22,happylifer,1

"I'm 30, born in a family full of milanisti and  started cheering for Milan of course. Everything changed when I saw that  photo of Ronaldo with Inter shirt, sanding on one foot, arms raised, like the Cristo Redentor statue in Rio. Well, I fell in love with Ronaldo and Inter of course. Still have a scarf of the 97 98 Inter team, with Baggio, Ventola, West, Winter, Pirlo, Djorkaeff and so on!

And the losing period began.

I survived all the lost derbies, with my dad cheering for Milan. The UCL semis in 2003 made me cry a lot!

And I survived all the banter coming  from my juvetini friends, when Juve was destroying us in early's 2000.

Then we started winning, and that felt strange because I wasn't used to watch at Inter winning titles. After our second game against Barcelona in UCL semis in 2009, I went out of home and started running alone shouting my happiness to everyone like a crazy guy.

The last eleven years of my love story with Inter passed pretty harshly, and in a couple of  years I've got used to watch all my Juventus friends celebrating. It was normal for me to look at the serie A ladder every May and see Juventus in first place.

And then Suning and Conte joined us, with all the new players and that year happened. I was feeling we were going to win since december. Juventus wasn't the same anymore and Milan coudln't keep going like they were for all the season.

We were just better, despite all the criticism for UCL elimination and National Cup.

We deserved.

I didn't make fun of my friends cheering for Milan and Juve, I'm not that guy. Just hope we can keep going through the road we took this year and keep being a top tier team for a long time.

Thanks to FC Inter and Suning for those rediscovered emotions. GG",gyszj2y,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-20 18:04:07,MahhTheSixth,1

"I‚Äôm an Inter fan since ever. I lived rooting for Cruz, Zamorano, Recoba, Adriano and of course the only real one Ronaldo! I felt the anger from that infamous foul Iuliano-Ronaldo, the emptiness from that missed Scudetto 05-05-2002, the euphoric Triplete 22-05-2010 and the consequent void from that historical feat.

I was just a student when the last galaxy team in Italy was present and now I‚Äôm 32 with a lovely wife and two sons and times have changed. Honestly I wasn‚Äôt very active during these times (especially after Moratti era) and my burning flame withered waiting for the right moment to burn brightly.

We finally returned to be n.1 in Italy ending the terror era from Rubentinis, I can finally walk straight up in front of my rossoneri/bianconeri friends and watch their endlessly efforts to shrink our Scudetto with meaningless economic problems (like we‚Äôre the only ones ü§î).

Being from Australia, I watched Atalanta v Sassuolo at midnight.

At work the next day I have a colleague in another city who is a big Juve supporter, so organized a few other guys to cover his desk in Inter colors before he arrived in the morning. He was not pleased, it was great.

"This Scudetto is truly bitter sweet. I'm happy that we've won after so long but also worried by the financial future of this club. The last thing we all want is for this team that has been built for years eventually collapsed because Suning can't secure funding for next season. I'd hate to lose any of our stars next season. I'm grateful for Suning but maybe it's time they let go. 

For now though, we celebrate. It feels good to talk shit to Juve and Milan fans after so long. If we can keep this team intact while adding talented youth as depth then I'd be more than satisfied. We'll get the 2nd star next season, CL will be a welcomed bonus.

"Being a 20 year old Inter fan since 2007 is very hard because it means that you have experienced your first Scudetto at the age of 7, the Triplete at the age of 9 and the banter era during the rest of your teen years.

Well, believe it or not, that‚Äôs exactly my story: an Italian kid fascinated by the Mancini/Mourinho streak in his early days and then let down by the harsh reality of growing up and watching his beloved team slowly decay when he was finally ready to enjoy football ‚Äúconsciously‚Äù (as a grown up individual, if that means anything).

I started supporting Inter because of the colors: black and blue, my two favorites. I loved to leaf through my albums with collectible stickers (ah, good memories) to finally settle on Inter‚Äôs page and just stare at their stunning home kit with stripes! Then Ibrahimovic arrived. He immediately became my ‚Äúhero‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know much about football, but that‚Äôs what they call **love at first sight**, I guess.

My father supports Napoli, and so do my little brother, all of my uncles and my grandpa. He tried *so hard* to turn me into a fan of his team (when I played football with my friends as a kid he forced me to wear a Calai√≤ shirt, that was kinda embarrassing to be honest) but the 5 Scudetti and our Triplete surely weren‚Äôt helpful to his mission. He gave up during the banter years: I was too in love with Inter, that kind of love you show not only when things are going well but also (and most importantly) when you miss UEL ending up 9th in the league or when you lose 3-1 to fucking Novara. We all know pretty well that **endurance** is the quality of every true Inter fan, but my case was the perfect example of this particular condition since the only memories I had of an Inter trophy were blurred and so distant in the past...

I‚Äôve already mentioned somewhere in this sub that I had never watched a whole game where Inter beat Juve, partially because of bad luck (I missed the few winning games of the banter era, like the 1-3 with Stramaccioni and the 2-1 with De Boer) and too vague memories (I was too little to actually remember vividly any game from the 2007/2010 era, except of course the defining games like the UCL semifinals/final or the Siena game which will forever be in my heart; yes, you're not wrong, this means that I have no original memory of the Maicon super-goal to Juve, sad story). The 2-0 victory against Juve this January was hence the **first time** I have witnessed Inter smash Juve. And I mean *consciously*. This is actually mind blowing to say the least.

So what? Turns out that this was my **first Scudetto as a grown up man**, the first one I could follow with an incredible community like you guys (sharing rage and joy during games is always an amazing feeling), the first one I have felt the *pressure* of losing because I experienced it without having the innocence of my younger years.

It was also an amazing birthday present because I was born on May 1st, the day we secured the top of the league, once for all, against Crotone. I usually hate birthdays but this time I was literally forced to enjoy it thanks to Eriksen and Hakimi!

This Scudetto almost feels like a Christian confirmation, an Inter fan for 14 years who has finally grown up and now will support his team **FOREVER**.

"It's been a while since the 09/10 triple ooh wee and it feels like something heavy has been lifted off the shoulders. The memories of the past decade is a blurr of ups and downs, however the past couple years the matchdays have been spent on discord with two fellow armchair-experts and Inter-fans discussing who we currently hate and who we love in the squad. Occasionally we would get a guest appearance from equally fine armchair-experts in the form of my little brother ***^who ^I ^presumably ^dropped ^on ^the ^head ^when ^he ^was ^a ^baby ^- ^he ^ended ^up ^a ^Milan-fan*** and my best friend who's so crazy for Roma that he got a Totti tattoo. 

&amp;nbsp;As any armchair-expertdiscussion they are not that memorable but the things that stuck with me was how much both 2/3 of the Inter-camp and the Milan/Roma-camp wanted Icardi out. He was simultaneously ""a bad player and bad for the squad"" and ""Inters biggest threat"" and when he left everyone rejoiced, however the results that followed was not what our Inter-camp hoped for. 

&amp;nbsp;The second thing that stuck with me in our discussions was the hate for Candreva, how we wanted him out ASAP, how the coach could even have him on the bench, how we could do a better job on the field, how even our grandmas could do a better cross then THAT!! etc. The Milan-Roma experts in our group loved him for that reason. Our prayers got heard and he left the team, on top of that we became CHAMPIONS.

&amp;nbsp;Leaving the armchair-expert aside I kinda had a feeling that this was our season. So I prematurely got a custom made [snusdosa](https://imgur.com/a/38GLB8g) days before they announced the new logo.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;As for celebrating the scudetto well, it was not what I would imagine but that's the times we live in at the moment. I went on discord and chatted with the boys, watched the livestream-celebrations and went to my brother, hugged him and told him ""not even close"". I even tried to get something from the Inter-shop but it was so overloaded that I gave up on it.

"I started following Inter in fall of 2014, just before I spent 6 months in Italy for study. I attended the 0-0 Milan Derby in spring of 2015, which was my first European soccer match (and probably my first ever live soccer match of any kind). 

I will never forget the atmosphere in that stadium. And the looks we got from inter fans as we found out seats. But, as soon as we started cheering and being wild, those looks went away and we were all focused on the match. 

I remember having a conversation (in broken Italian) at a metro stop in Milano the day of that derby with an elderly man. He was a milanista, but he was excited that a foreigner was interested and knew enough about calcio in Milano to talk about the teams intelligently. I‚Äôll never forget that. 

I didn‚Äôt understand what the banter era was until later, and I really only got to see 1/2 of it. And if I feel the way I do now with the Scudetto after only  1/2 the Banter era, I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine going through the whole thing.

Ever since Suning took over and appointed Spalletti and Conte back to back, our growth and progression has been fantastic. I know we dread to say it, but we just might be out of banter era.

"I am only 21, so one can say I had a relatively easy childhood growing up seeing Inter dominate Italy and eventually the whole of Europe. However, after I moved to the UK in 2011 the situation quickly changed. The next 10 years were certainly hard: going from Cambiasso to Mudingay, from Milito to Belfodil, from Maicon to lord Jonathan etc; witnessing Rubentus dominate Italy while struggling to qualify for the Europa league; seeing managers change three times in a season. Despite all of this my love for Inter never withered and if anything if has been reinforced.

At the start of this season I thought that this year would be our best chance, but I was still afraid given our talent for bottling. The first few games were a bit shaky and I can't say that being knocked out of the Champions League didn't hurt; however, the team very quickly created an identity. From November to May we absolutely steam-rolled the league with this beautiful team that Suning has helped to create. After the win against Cagliari where Darmian scored I shed the first tears because I knew we were going to do it. When Sassuolo drew against Atalanta last week I was overwhelmed with joy‚Äì I called my friend in Italy who had gone to Duomo to celebrate and face timed him for two hours while dancing and singing SIAMO NOI with the fans.

"It's so great to read all your answers, it really makes me appreciate even more what this title really means. I want to add my answer as well.^1 

I have written before in this sub how I became interista as a little child (like, 3 years old) and how Inter has been part of my life since then, even if no one in my family is really a football fan. I have mentioned my favorite players growing up and the struggles of being basically the only interista in a school where every kid was milanista/juventino (being the early-mid 90s). I think I also mentioned how I got my first kiss from a girl (I was in 7th grade) thanks to Inter.^2


But since the topic here is focused on this season and the celebrations, this is what I did. I had May 2^nd circled on the calendar in my office since mid-March. I don't know, I had a feeling that might be the date. Nevertheless, being stuck in Milano since last summer, I decided to book a weekend away to [Liguria](https://old.reddit.com/r/VillagePorn/comments/n2hm6u/manarola_italy/), to do some trekking and relax a little bit. I watched Inter - Crotone from a tiny apartment with a [stunning view](https://imgur.com/a/0EMmUXC) and then waited.


I went back to Milano the following day by train and I tried not to think about Sassuolo - Atalanta. I failed. When the match was about to finish the train was going through lots of tunnels, so I had no Internet connection/radio. People on the train looked at me, as I couldn't sit still and kept looking at my phone uselessly. Then, I got my connection back, and received a text from a dear friend of mine (my stadium buddy): ""E' NOSTRO"" (It's ours). I had tears in my eyes. I got up, put on my Inter shirt and came here to write [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/n37x6c/inter_are_champions_of_italy/gwo2e9w/?context=3) and read all of your comments and posts. I started receiving lots of texts from friends and acquaintances. I am lucky enough to have a job that has allowed me to meet people from all over the world, and apparently many of them remembered my passion for Inter. I got messages from Brazil, India, Japan, Iran and so on. When I arrived in Milano an hour later, I went to [Piazza Duomo](https://old.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/n3d3we/celebration_in_piazza_duomo/). I tried to avoid large gatherings, sang some choruses, took pictures and had a beer. As someone else mentioned in this comment section, the best feeling was looking at ~~total strangers~~ brothers and sharing thumbs up, giant smiles (well, with face masks) and congratulations. I had missed it so much.

So, that was my contribution. Thanks to the rest of the mod team for taking care of this place, to u/Tranceh for his incredible generosity and to all of you for sharing your experiences and for being part of this community.


AMALA!

^2 I was really shy but I made friends with this girl whose father was from Venice, and in an unprecedented (and largely unmatched thereafter) boost of confidence, I bet a kiss that Zamorano would score a hattrick in the upcoming Inter - Venezia. BAM BAM BAM, that happened (thank you Ivan). We ""dated"" a few weeks but then she left me for a milanista who was a couple of years older and had a moped...GUESS WHAT BITCH I THINK I MOVED ON PRETTY WELL SINCE THEN ENJOY THE PATHETIC MLM BUSINESS AND THE FUCKING MINIONS MEMES ON FACEBOOK!",gxldv32,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-10 18:44:42,mangowhymango,1
"I'm an Inter since 97, I was 7, My father (Interista) noticed I had too many Juventini around me, and that I wasn't that into the beautiful sport called Calcio, Soccer, Futbol/Football. He sat me down and said. 

""Son, us Inter, are a team of great honor and principles, morales and values, with a history rich of champions, look we just signed the best player in the world, his name is Ronaldo and we have a player whose chilean like your mother he's a champ called Bam Bam Zamorano.""

So I started watching games with him, I can perfectly remember the 3-0 win against lazio in the uefa league final. With a young Pupi, Bam Bams goal and Ronaldos step over dribble on the goalie to score, I was obsessed with the step over dribble, I can still remember doing it infront of the TV while watching the trophy celebration followed to frantically jumping up and down shouting with joy and hugging my dad and thanking him to teaching me the beauty of loving this sport and supporting la beneamata.

Many years go by, the away return match of the 2009-2010 UCL semi final against Barcelona, with one man down, whole game of agony pretty much, yet the most beautiful game for a lover of defensive games. Etoo as a LWB Lucio and Samuel were walls, Messi was surrounded by zanetti samuel and cambiasso, whatever shot took off, Julio Cesar would tip it off from the goal. Then Piques goal, panic, anxiety tightens, Bojans goal, the dream collapsed... No the goal was not valid. the triple whistle match is over and i just started crying for joy for the first time. I didn't even have the same reaction in the WC06 final even though feeling the same. I called my dad that we couldn't see the game together and my joyed together, while I danced by myself crying in the bathroom. The final was different I had the confidence we were gonna win and finally as a whole family to celebrated the crowning of ok triplete.

2021, After going through two very difficult years, personally and professionally. I had faith after the gut pain feeling from the Sevilla, final, after losing my job, after being dumped by my girlfriend, that things will get better.

2nd of May 2021, a sort of rebirth has happened to me, I'm not depressed anymore, I finally found a job, My personal project is advancing fruitfully, I found love for myself e siamo campioni d'italia I together like our team rose from the ashes like a Phoenix. Inter taught me not to give up, no matter how bad or how close, you will get there. I ran to piazza duomo after the sassuolo-atalanta game. For the first time in my life I could finally celebrate with fellow interisti because i was either in torino (yes nella tana dei nemici) or abroad. Seeing the square brighten up after a string of rainy days, so many people in the city with their inter flags jerseys. Cars, mopeds even tractors honking their horns so many people joyous, the feeling was contagious electrifying after the difficult years we have all gone through as fans and as humans because of covid and it‚Äôs repercussions this celebration seeing so many people together rejoicing: the chanting, the jumping, the flags, us brothers of the world finally celebrating. I was shocked didn't know how to react I would swallow the knot in my throat seeing people cry of happiness, children overwhelmed by the joy seeing their team win for the first time, such a strong vibrant feeling. Im still processing the fact we are champions. And in doubt whenever I see or text a juventino or milanista doenst matter if I know them or not... E SE NE VA, LA CAPOLISTA SE NE VA! SIAMO CAMPIONI D'ITALIA!!!",gxzzphh,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-14 01:14:41,drisauce,1

"It took an Argentinian friend to drag me in the world of football and to Inter (that 1st match 4-3w v Milan really helped his case), another 14y before I could appreciate it with a little savviness(slow learner here)

 On that front [Il malpensante](https://www.ilmalpensante.com/) really helped, not just for the game per se but for the contest: Italian society, politics etc. A proof of how I changed (in better I hope): I liked Nagatomo, a respectful, professional give-it-all guy. Malpy destroyed him with a [49s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5654u4culs) where you can see how football is similar to chess: you have to master time and place. I know you could say that for many sports, maybe this one stood out for the rarity of ""points""during a match, thus creating more tension and unfortunately space for luck.

I think even a neutral (even towards football and sports in general) could respect the founding statement of this club, and that is the reason why I'm still around this world. Spread those words.",gy6pqul,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-15 13:30:29,MtDorp96,1
I watched some Inter games back in 2009 but actually became a fan after Euro 2012. It was though to see a mediocre squad in banter decade. This Scudetto was sth we needed to increase our team mentality. Congrats to all Inter fans!,gy7b9au,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-15 19:01:34,Lori80,1

"I am just going to go for the 10x50 euro, because I do not have a particularly interesting story, but I will share it anyway. When I was 12 years old, my best mate was a huge Milan supporter. So naturally, when I randomly switched on the TV in 2009, and saw Inter leading 4-0 against the Rossonero, there was no doubt in my mind, which club I got to support onward. It was both a blessing and a curse to experience the Treble so young, because I could not fully appreciate how big of a deal it was. So for me, this Scudetto might mean even more. I was the typical fan, who believed in Kharja and Schelotto, thought Ricky Alvarez and Johnatan will give us a silverware, and rated Belfodil higher than Icardi. This title still feels unreal after all the hopes last year after year. If I do receive a gift card, I will buy my first original kit (these chinese replicas have such a shitty material) with the name of D'Ambrosio.

"I was there Gandalf! 11 years ago at the bernabeu I was there ! Since then I've suffered the eras of men such as Silvestre , Gargano, Guarin, Ricky alvarez, Jonathan, Kuzmanovic and many more who were unworthy of the shirt !

"I was born and raised, surrounded by Rubentini uncles and Bilanisti bigger cousins. ""They had me in the first half, not gonna lie"". But on a hot summer evening, while I (at the age of 5) was with my parents at a local village festival, a particular thing caught my eye: a small calculator and few other gadgets bundled together, on display at a toy stand. Only when I was back home I noticed that golden logo repeated on every gadget, and that particular black and azure palette. I asked my mother which team it was, and she said ""Inter"". ¬´Well, mom, I'll be a Inter fan from now on¬ª.

From that very day I went with you all in our journey, through miseries and miracles, lights and darkness. Tears of joy at our UEFA Cup, my first ever trophy. Tears of sadness when wiping the VHS I used to record Lazio-Inter in 2002. And then, the greatest achievement of all.

I don't know if it was only for that licensed calculator, or maybe my Interista grandpa that I never knew, or what people call destiny. I never regretted the decision I made that very evening, and I feel proud because being Interista was, is and always will be my personal choice. Because what would be a match, if it's not Pazza? What is football, without Inter? What is a win, without the losses?

Being different it's our essence, it's how we were born. And when finally our moment comes, the day we stand tall and victorious... That day, that is today, I can only shout, together with you: I'M SCUDETTO!",gytoime,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-20 22:09:30,william_weatherby,1

"Been an Inter fan in the US since 2009 (hell of a time to start), which quickly swung in the other direction. The banter era was miserable with no friends who even follow Serie A, so I was constantly subjected to constant exasperated questions of ""why Inter?!"". 


Those times were survived by putting excessive hours into Football Manager to show what **SHOULD** have happened that year. Endlessly trying to convince myself that we are *this* close to a recovery and were just unlucky.


The win this year has been surreal, and has been made all the sweeter with Juve struggling so badly after everyone assumed they would just waltz their way into another Scudetto.  And I will be capping my celebrations off by adding another glorious Internazionale scarf to my collection.",gyz39ok,n7z68c,FCInterMilan,2021-05-22 02:56:08,junkyard_cat,1

"Obviously the match has been very entertaining because both teams are just playing for the fun of it, with no real objectives left, and it's been very enjoyable. I still have no clue how Sanchez scored his second, amazing strike. And, well, I guess they did tell Gagliardini that Sampdoria is still a team from Genova because he's having a great match.

We need a new keeper though, out of 3 (almost 4) goals scored against us the last 6 matches, 3 (almost 4) are Handa's fault. I think with one more appearance he'll break Inter's appearance record, but after that (which he deserves) I hope we just turn to the next page and get on with a new, proper keeper.",gxel0dn,n7r0d2,FCInterMilan,2021-05-09 01:04:53,5kyLegend,3

As Ausilio said, first they will talk with the coach about how things will go on and then we will see. 

The message sent was that the essential players will stay (I.e., Lukaku, Lautaro, Barella, Hakimi, Bastoni, DeVrij). If we want to buy players, we have to sell, which basically means we have to trade... 

My best guess will be that if Young leaves, Dimarco would replace him (if Hellas does not activate the buy clause), we would try to get a free agent/cheap striker and maybe if Vidal leaves, we could get Javi Martinez who will be a free agent.

"We've had a recent discussion about solid strikers the other day: notice that (and I agree, it's just the way it is) a solid striker that can be a good replacement is going to be an expensive player both transferwise and salarywise, and at the same time he is going to spend most days on the bench. So I already foresee future discussions here of _""player X is so expensive, and he isn't contributing, we shouldn't have signed him""_ or the like: if you want good players you must pay them well, _especially_ if you keep them as 3rd-4th choice. Same goes for whatever quality midfielder we want to get.

If this team is going to play for the next Scudetto or the Champion's League (and I bloody hope we will, at last) then it goes without saying that you cannot achieve it by saving on expenses and this must be made clear to the owners too.",gx0ilqr,n5cpv6,FCInterMilan,2021-05-05 19:25:16,evergreengt,1

"The back up striker for me is a problem, because you can‚Äôt find a quality player who would be fine with sitting on the bench for the majority of the season, only playing last 15mins of a game and full games against lower table and relegation teams. Giroud would be my choice but he‚Äôs been wanting to leave Chelsea because of the lack of playing time so why would he come here then ? 




The ideal LWB for me is Gosens, he‚Äôs great and already proven in Serie a, if we can get him great but if we can‚Äôt, Kostic is another great option.




We definitely need a CM, De Paul has been linked to us for a long time, I think he would be a great signing. We also need a back up CB.





And last but not least, we need a new GK, we have been linked with Musso, Cragno, Meret and  also Silvestri. Imo Musso would cost a lot of money so I don‚Äôt see us going for him, Napoli would demand a lot for Meret too, and Silvestri is old so why go for him ? My personal choice would be Cragno, he‚Äôs young and already a very good keeper, we could get a good deal for him by inserting Nainggolan in the deal if they stay up and if they go down then it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to get him.",gx0uc0m,n5cpv6,FCInterMilan,2021-05-05 21:20:52,Lothar18,1

"We've had to climb hill over hill to get there. We won everything, and then we fell so, so far down, it took some heroes to bring us here. Handanovic and yes, even Icardi carrying us through banter era, Spalletti making a team that honestly may not have been that good get into the Champions League two years in a row, giving us enough money to finally be able to take a step forward.

And then, even bigger heroes. Antonio Conte, who came to the dismay of many, many fans who thought of him as a double agent, as a wrong step for us. Then Romelu Lukaku, a huge football player (in every way) and an even bigger man. Bastoni, Skriniar, De Vrij: our heroes in our defense. Barella and Brozovic, making our midfield together with Eriksen who entered our team and found it hard to fit in, but turned into a protagonist. Hakimi, Darmian and even Perisic, who have been handling an extremely difficult role. And then, Lautaro helping out Lautaro as the best goalscoring duo I've seen in a while.

All with Marotta and Suning bringing us where we are, making us take that huge step we needed, that Inter deserved, when with all the Superleague shit that happened lately.

I haven't even mentioned all the players like Sanchez, D'Ambrosio and everyone else who helped us out massively. But... We came all the way here. Back to being Champions. Back to being the best team in Italy.

Also on a personal level, it's been a tough decade. And as much as I learned to put things in perspective, a little morale boost from this useless, crazy thing that is football would have helped.

But finally here we are, we won it and I am over the moon.

Allow me to say that I am especially happy to have witnessed all these years, and today, as a part of this wonderful community. I have met fantastic people and learned a lot.


Now, let's enjoy this.

Rangers fan here. Just want to congratulate you on stopping Juves 10 in a row as we did celtics. Also Inter will always hold a special place in my heart as the first game I ever attended was the champions league group stages in 2005 at Ibrox which ended Rangers 1-1 Inter to see us through into the knockout round.

"I was 13 when inter last won. When the dark ages started it was rough for me because for most of my childhood inter was winning and I wasn‚Äôt used to seeing my team struggle that much. I would often cry when we lost and get super upset. At some point I started wondering if we would ever get back to our glory days. I would be lying if I said I lost some hope at times.

If you would have told me that the next time inter will raise a trophy I would be a 24 year old adult living across the globe and with a job I would not believe you. These 11 years feel like a lifetime.

Even better, now we have more Scudetti than Bilan!

My MVP is Barella, he's been lights out for us, more than anybody else including Lukaku.   
I still have my reserves on Conte as he made costly mistakes early on despite this team being clearly better than all the others, especially in a year in which rube sucked with a rookie manager, but I'll give him credit for keeping the team tight in the most difficult environment in the Serie A.

Everyone thought we paid too much for Lukkaku and look, everyone thought we wasted money on Eriksen, the Spurs fans are sick with envy and finally Christian has the trophy he deserves, everyone thought Young and Darmian were Man Utd rejects and now look, no one believed we should buy Sanchez now LOOK, he has been pivotal to our success - el nino meravilgia super sub, now they all bleed black and blue.

For years my Juventino cousin has been mocking me (even though we were both raised in Milan) and now LOOK cuz.

To my brothers and sisters of the world, and my kin in supporting this incredible club, it‚Äôs brought us so much pain but now we can all unclench and enjoy.

There is a famous movie quote that encapsulates it perfectly

"Couldn‚Äôt watch the whole game, the first 20/25 minutes (until Lukaku‚Äôs post) have been extremely hard to swallow, after that I haven‚Äôt been able to focus on the game anymore but seeing with the corner of my eye the ball getting so close to the target on my phone screen just made me more and more nervous lmao. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt watch the second half because I like to think that a break from the screen is what was needed to score and win another stressful, tight and tense game. 

What I love the most is that the combination of first goal scorers is Darmian (Cagliari) - Eriksen (Napoli) - Perisic (Spezia) - Darmian (Verona) - Eriksen (Crotone) and now it would be hella cool if Perisic will be the one scoring vs Sampdoria. I mean, it means a lot because the players scoring are actually the most improved ones since January and statistics are proving Conte and the team right. 

What a cool birthday gift by this team, we‚Äôve finally sealed the scudetto once for all and can enjoy the Sassuolo game tomorrow with no pressure at all. I‚Äôll be fine with any result, a win vs Sampdoria is what we really need to close this race. After that...",gwl1n0x,n2ni31,FCInterMilan,2021-05-02 04:47:54,Roaming_Dinosaur,3

"Chelsea fan here, wanted a view from you guys on Lukaku. I Completely appreciate that he‚Äôs massively improved his game and was really important for you guys last season, but how would you compare him with the likes of some other successful strikers you‚Äôve had? His goal scoring and assists stats are elite but how would his overall play compare against Eto, Milito, Ibrahimovic, and Icardi. (Only talking about their stints at Inter). 
Also considering his style of play and fitness levels  how long would you expect him to continue being an elite striker before the age factor comes into play? If you had the money and needed a striker, would you bid 130m for a 28 year old Lukaku? 

I‚Äôm personally very excited about Lukaku but wanted some perspective from you guys.

If the story is true in the first place, of course‚Ä¶ but I believe he would be a really good replacement for Lautaro.

"I'm a Milan fan, let me be honest here. 

Inter is getting a good CAM player. He sucked at Milan because, we didn't have a proper striker. All we had was 1/2 season injured Ibra and wingers like Rebic, immature 21 yo Leao as striker. With Lukaku and lautaro upfront, Hakan will be providing lot of assists.  Suso left Milan, won UEL and so does Bacca. Now look at Andre Silva, he is banging goals for Frankfurt for fun. He also sucked at Milan. 

You're getting a good, set piece delivery player and decent mid fielder. 

In a nutshell, Inter is getting a good player. Too bad he never had good managers and strikers at milan.

FORGET THE DELUDED MILAN FANS. We told everyone sucked at Milan, but they went on and had success elsewhere. Now another one is coming back to haunt.",h2jo54z,o4sxhv,FCInterMilan,2021-06-21 23:31:13,Vivek_5Z3R0,25

Only 3 players were good on our side: Dimarco, Darmian, DDD.

Radja is playing with 1%, obviously his head in Sardinia.

Dallbert, omg. Offers nothing at all, only mistakes. I am surprised he refused Turkey. He might even not be good enough to play there.

Pinamonti-Satriano almost invisible in Lugano‚Äôs defense

Gags is playing like he doesn‚Äôt need to prove anything. idk if he doesn‚Äôt make up for the quality he lacks with effort, why should he even play.. 

Our build up play is nothing better than last year, team is almost clueless on how to get the ball forward without Lukaku.

"It really grinds my gears to read transfer links to Scamacca or Kean when we have our own players in-house that are at the same level but with higher ceiling.

I'm telling you, if Rashford and Greenwood were Inter Primavera products they'd be playing for SPAL and Crotone running after farmers in Serie B.

Inter has to buy Espo back next year and preferably keep him in Basel for another year on loan. There is simply no reason for Inter not to replace Dzeko with Esposito once his contract runs out in 2 years time.",hatlk3m,pdy1fh,FCInterMilan,2021-08-30 00:49:24,TheCLNR,10

Great reaction in the 2nd half. Obviously, Correa was phenomenal, but I think there wasn't anyone that didn't good...maybe Brozo, but he was constantly pressed.

Best thing is we won a game started bad due to our mistake. We got through that hard first half without losing our mind.",ham1a43,pcvmg0,FCInterMilan,2021-08-28 06:05:37,Tanikos,10

Our midfield not connected at all.  
Im not sure Brozo has his position secured, today we saw he is not better than Jorginho.  
I though Dzeko is better with the ball, today some bad passes, bad choices. Lautaro knows he needs to be the leader of this team, and today he showed, he was great.

"I won't comment the first half. It was a struggle. Handa my man, I love you but the signs are ligning up, the star is fading.

Impressed by Calha's interceptions, wouldn't have expected that. Traces of Rafinha although a different player. Barella as semi-regista for a while was interesting to see. Vidal too good to be true - I'd rather wait and enjoy the new found grit.

Buildup play is still tough game for us but the players are learning eachother's moves. Still too many wrong passes, especially when lobbing the ball for short passes - something I'd never understand. Brozo had some glimpses of random crazyness today and Dzeko fought his battles albeit disappearing sometimes.

Lautaro fighting a ton but a wee too weak on the legs for my taste. Threw a couple of good runs away taking a fall. He was fouled, but a bit more grit would have opened chances.

Correa was a blast, but that Darmian run was something else, I was in awe. When Brozo and Perisic were subbed, the game turned, but Verona also had burned through their fuel by then.

Looked grim, didn't start pretty but ended that way.",haludcs,pcvmg0,FCInterMilan,2021-08-28 05:14:47,adrenalinda75,17

"First half after Handa's mistake was bad, didn't really like that, we didn't play like Champions of Italy. But we had a good reaction in the 2nd half, I feel like we're still a little bit chaotic in some situations but we managed to control the game and tempo better and the rest comes by itself.
It was a tough game and Verona wanted and managed to make us nervous. Heavy 3 points.

I like seeing Vidal playing football instead of some sport he played last year. Still does some nonsense things sometimes, but hopefully after knee surgery he can come back!

Oh, and then there's Correa, well, what can you say to someone who debuts with 2 goals? I hope he can reach full potential with Inzaghi!",hals4vj,pcvmg0,FCInterMilan,2021-08-28 04:58:33,Lollosissimo-937,9
"Super happy for Correa, what a debut!!!!!

Honestly after a whole summer of relaxation, my asshole was not ready for another butt clenching game, we always play like this at the Bentegodi, Verona are very tough away from home. I expected a tough game.

Inzaghi has been doing everything perfect until now, impeccable timing and choice in the subs, with everyone coming in with the right mindset. I‚Äôm eager to see how we face tougher opponents, but so far I like this active style of football, even if it involves some risks. 

Games under Conte were much more grindy, often involving reactive play and waiting for mistakes coming from the opposing team. Liking spiazeball so far, we already have Inzaghi‚Äôs identity.

"God, this match was exhausting. We need a new keeper though, is there any available one for cheap? Should be a top priority investment.

We lost our heads after the goal we gifted to Verona, but we insisted and we won. And yes, Inzaghi actually won the match with his changes: Vidal today was a BEAST (seriously, hate him or not for his last season, he fought like an animal today), Darmian had an insane cross for Correa and I love him, and... El Tucu Correa won us the match, what a fucking debut.

I'll add, there was a soft pen for us that was a pen nonetheless, and to everyone saying it was soft and shouldn't have been given: we'll see how many matches Juve or Milan win thanks to pens like that this season. Verona played their hearts out, it looked like a CL Final for them... So, I'm glad we managed it in the end.

But anyways, now the team needs to wake the fuck up, we became all over the place after the goal, we need to get our shit together in the 2nd half, it's not gonna be easy.

"Good.


Inzaghi played against Genoa similarly to how Conte wanted to when we started last season - high pressing, bodies in the box, and marauding centerbacks. However, with Conte we didn't seem to have the personnel to move fluidly or constantly retain possession in the final third, leading to terrible counters against us.


Now with Dzeko (who's far more technical than Lukaku), Correa, a forward Sensi, and maybe Sanchez, I think we can execute Inzaghi's ideas better. Plus we have Lauti and possibly Belotti to do the #9 work.",ha721ps,pat77a,FCInterMilan,2021-08-25 02:54:42,commando_and_hobbes,24

"30 Million is, in my opinion, still too much for Correa - but the situation is what it is, and it's already a miracle Marotta managed to get him at this price, and with this formula. After all the sales we've had, Inzaghi deserves at least one player he requested directly, so I'll be optimistic about him even though I've never been a big fan.

Now, I guess we'd still have some money to use, and two main spots that need filling. We're either not going to get anyone else, or another striker (Belotti maybe?) since Sanchez is way too unreliable with his injuries - but I'd honestly also remember we're in dire need of a good goalkeeper since Handa is visibly, obviously declining to the point he's making mistakes not even mid-tier keepers would make.

Correa by the other side is more kinda player to rotate with Toro, or play alongside him like Correa and Ciro did, but i preffer to have one like true number 9 when playing with our formation.

"Fantastic debuts from Dzeko and Calhanoglu. The link up play from Dzeko was top notch throughout, especially when receiving from Handanovic. The chest control displayed in the build up to his goal was supreme.

I think we'll be more fun to watch under Inzaghi with an emphasis on attacking football as opposed to the defense first approach of Conte. We'll also concede more goals and drop more points but I'm ok with that trade off. I think it will also help us in Europe.

Vanheusden impressed with a few good challenges and a couple of runs forward. Looks made for our formation and style.

The inability of Perisic to stay onside when looking across the line is infuriating. It cost us goals last season and twice today was unforgivable.

That aside, it couldn't have been a better start to the season. Forza Inter!",h9tj6xz,p8wlk1,FCInterMilan,2021-08-22 03:01:39,voidlookingbackatyou,29

Calhanoglu with a dream debut will certainly make some AC Milan fans punch the air.

"Was definitely a clunky match, it showed it's only Week 1. After the well-oiled machine we turned into by the end of last season, we definitely have some work to do to close the gap. Sensi looked lost playing behind Edin, you could tell it's not what he's used to compared to when he played closer to Brozo at the beginning of 2020/21.

Looks like we're gonna squeeze every drop of value from the roster we've got which is definitely a change from the Conte administration. Looking forward to seeing players like Satriano and Dimarco get more minutes if that is the case, which should also make a lot of people happy over signing some randos like we normally would. I also hope players like Vidal and Vecino can keep their head down and deliver when it comes to it.

"- We finally have a coach who tries new stuff, gets everyone involved and gives young talents a decent time to show their worth.

-  we can't say yet what this team will accomplish, but frankly we look so much better than anyone expected. Idk if we are as strong as last year, but we surely don't lack the inspiration. I watched games with Lukaku, Hakimi, Eriksen on the field where we were very clueless and only look for Lukaku to build up play. Today we have many ideas to try.

- The only thing I miss from last year is our counter attacking threat. It was heavily dependent on Lukaku and Hakimi. We lack the chemistry in these situations for now, but I am sure Inzaghi won't let this persists. A player like Correa will be very useful for this.

- We are unexpectedly very aggressive in pressing the opponent. I was amused today by how proactive we were on and OFF the ball. Something Conte wasn't the biggest fan of. 

- I don't know about you guys, but I didn't miss Lukaku today at all. I know Dzeko is slow and old but damn, he is so dominant in the area. He is so important in the build up and distribution of the ball (much better than Lukaku) right now I can't see him on the bench at all, we will miss his qualities a lot.

Inzaghi has made a huge mistake with this kickass start. Now our expectations are high again and he gotta deliver! just kidding of course, this is the best start he could have to insure the winnig mentality we must have. He needs to prove that Inter is no Lazio and every game is important. This is the perfect start to prove that.",h9thdlb,p8wlk1,FCInterMilan,2021-08-22 02:47:37,UnsuppressedAnger,19
"Elite team, Elite young manager and Elite performance. If this is the future of Inter (Sustainable financially and no Expensive Star Player) I'M ALL IN!

Veteran players like Dzeko and Vidal showed up and prove that age is just a number, while Barella and Skriniar very commanding and impressive in every touch, just tasty. And how about Hakan Calhanoglu? Used to play with suck teammates now he collaborate well with his elite teammates and just shown his elite quality

It's the perfect opener for Inter, the season still long and there's no guarantee that we can always perform like this because this Genoa side is as dry as Ballardini's head.

"First 20 minutes were flawless, then a bunch of technical errors started creeping in. That Kallon chance at the end of the first half was some comical defending. Luckily Genoa is pretty much a Serie B team and we were never really threatened.  
I can already tell the main thing we lost with Lukaku and Hakimi: counterattacks. We're back to being slow as shit in transition. Hopefully Inzaghi allows more technical quality and freedom than his predecessor. I think we're pretty much set in defense, if we can sort out our attack we might stand a chance this season.",h9tfqar,p8wlk1,FCInterMilan,2021-08-22 02:34:59,danccmeighmeighs,6
"Genoa was very unimpressive, but a huge part of why they looked as bad as they did was because of how well we played, even I was surprised. We had a couple defensive messes, but we actually looked entertaining and full of ideas.

Dzeko surprised me, I expected him to be old and slow, and to do the bare minimum thanks to his experience, and yet he was one of the best and most useful players on the pitch. Great start for Calha, MVP of this match - now we wait to see if he found his role with Inzaghi, or if it's his usual ""play one match well, shit yourself the next three"".

Handanovic is hilarious though, we should play anyone but him. The moment where he saved an easy shot and just stayed in place, laying down watching the ball not go out was hilariously bad.

Good start though, I liked what I saw, especially considering the players we lost.",h9tfifj,p8wlk1,FCInterMilan,2021-08-22 02:33:21,5kyLegend,6

"I wonder, had Conte stayed with Hakimi (or not) and Chelsea made an approach would he still have left?

We were a better team than Chelsea past season, not even a question. They won the CL, a cup competition which at times relies on favourable run, opponents having an off night and marginal win. Teams win CL without being anywhere near the top best teams in Europe. And funny this was the second Chelsea CL win with them being not the best but shithoused to the final.

We won the league, proving over 38 games consistently dominating oppositions. We were poor in CL because Conte and the team got some things wrong. Chelsea had to survive till the last minute to secure top 4 position plus losing to Leicester in the Cup final.

The only reason he is leaving us for Chelsea is the uncertainty plus the money. I wouldn't have minded that in a way but it is the gaslighting and the manner he did it. We risked on him after we got rid of our proven goal scorer in Icardi. He used us to polish his image, eventhough he had horrendous Euro's, and claimed this is once in a life time. That's kicking us while we are down. Treating us like a small club and Chelsea is this super club.

After the 3-2 vs Sevilla we were literally DEMOLISHED by his own goal but we placed our bet on him for the following season and gave him the courage to go on. I don‚Äôt think English fans would‚Äôve done the same. I expect a lot of drama from them if Lukaku is gonna make some mistakes this season, and we know fans can either get the best or the worst out of you. Good luck Romelu, you‚Äôll need it.

"TLDR: this is just my job and Lukaku doesn't give a sh*t about Inter.

To reply more seriously: Yes, we would have signed to get such results in two years. But Mr. Pastorello purposely neglects the fact that Inter fans don't hate Lukaku and him for the move, but for the way thr move has occurred. Had Lukaku never said he was the king of Milan and had both of them not said a few days before the move that he would stay here out of love for the club, nobody would be getting so much hatred.

PS: Pastorello also forgets to say that his guy scored the game-winning own goal in the EL final and is also directly responsible for both eliminations in the group stage of the UCL (once for missing tons of chances and once by blocking a winning header in stoppage time on the goalline). But even still, Inter fans have always defended and loved him.",h8ssth5,p3oc9j,FCInterMilan,2021-08-14 00:29:29,LafayetDTA,58

- 'Chelsea's interest touched his soul'

- 'the video at stamford bridge while he was an anderlecht player'

Sorry, could you remind me who's the belgian striker that chose United over the team of his heart managed by his most favourite coach back in 2017? Maybe his """"soul"""" wasn't touched enough.

He should have grown some balls and said that he wanted to go because the project is more ambitious and he would earn more money, it would have been ''fine'' (kinda) and he would have spared us from reading such bullshit from his agent.",h8tlopy,p3oc9j,FCInterMilan,2021-08-14 03:41:45,HarryDeekolo,10

But why did Lukaku kept saying things that indicated he wanted to stay and showed his commitment to the club and the fans but bailed out few days before the league started?

"Lots of thoughts actually, and to be honest I'm more than a little upset right now. Obviously this isn't a coolheaded reaction to these, but:

* The fact that he just HAD to go for financial reasons is fake news. Romelu left because he always dreamed to play again for Chelsea, and the moment their offer arrived he ""thought about it"" (but clearly not that much since in a couple weeks he said yes), and then carried on with conviction with wanting to go to them. This, I don't like. Makes a lot of things that Lukaku said about us feel like nothing but lies since it took a quick offer to sway him to leave.

* Romelu hiding behind his Agent for this sort of ""press release"" without even saying goodbye to the fans himself. He had such beautiful words towards his fans just a month or two ago (how much he felt loved and supported by fans even after the EL Final loss, for example), and now he's silently joined Chelsea. No goodbye or anything.

* The fact that the entire first page has to be dedicated to playing the victim. I get it, there must have been assholes sending threats to Pastorello and his family and that HAD to be addressed, but as far as I'm aware the vast majority of the hate (and HARDCORE hate) has been directed towards the Zhang family. I don't like when the first thing one does is play the victim, comes off as manipulative.

I don't know. I just loved - and I mean, I really fucking adored Lukaku. If you set aside some of the Triplete legends, he'd be my favorite Inter player I've ever seen. And I really, really believed his words were truthful, that he loved Inter fans and especially that he loved playing for these colors. Having his Agent respond to fans in his stead while running away the moment an offer from Chelsea arrived, all after Inter and Conte especially fixed his career (having him go from the laughing stock of the PL to a Top 5 striker in the world)... It feels like a big series of betrayals. And I hate it.

Again: this isn't my coolheaded reaction, but I think it's also fair enough for me to feel this way. Ignorance is bliss I guess, because this release by Pastorello suddenly makes me change my opinion on this situation a whole damn lot.",h8st9iu,p3oc9j,FCInterMilan,2021-08-14 00:32:22,5kyLegend,18

My thought is here. It's useless to point the finger at the ownership and play the victim. They reached an agreement with Chelsea because they wanted to leave, not because we kicked him out, everybody understood it now. He was just lucky to find an ownership that easily let him go. The only victims here are Marotta, Ausilio and Inzaghi, who have been disappointed just like us by the lies of Lukaku and Suning.

And now Lukaku isn't even brave enough to speak up. Instead, he lets his asshole agent speak for him. And pastorello is acting like we should thank him for selling our best player in AUGUST. If he sold him in June at least the club was more prepared to find a replacement. Now it's late as fuck. And he acts like we should thank them for it. That drives me crazy.

IT'S LUKAKU THE ONE WHO SOULD THANK US. Before Inter he was nobody. Constantly underrated and mocked by his own fans and entire England. We made him who he is now. He should thank us. This asshole pastorello didn't even have the decency to SHUT UP and go the fuck away.

"I have already said enough about this Lukaku situation but I hear a lot of fans say that it's okay that he left, it's just the way he did it and I couldn't disagree more, him leaving is not okay, the way he did it just adds icing on the cake. Why is it okay that a player leaves a club that believed in him when he was literally a meme, the lowest point of his career when even his own club Man Utd didn't want him and we splashed 80m on him and completely transformed his career, and the love he received from the fans here after a lot of difficult moments like the EL final, he was treated like he was Messi. Again only god knows where Lukaku would be if we didn't believe in him. And when this club that did everything for him gets into a bad situation, he decides to leave them and join a club in a better situation. How's that okay ? If he wanted to stay he could have stayed.

I don't blame Lukaku for abandoning a club in difficulty to join a club with a better project and in a better position, but this shows that he's not the idol everyone was making him up to be, he's not someone who should be considered for being captain, and lastly he does not love the club or the fans as much he said over the course of his time with us.",h8tai05,p3oc9j,FCInterMilan,2021-08-14 02:26:42,Lothar18,2

"ok, hear me out (edit: on moblie, so formatting is off and if I fix it, the reply is gonna be far too long for comfort, sorry)

If you're Lukaku, you have:
- been named a consensus top 5 striker in the world numerous times;
- made your career in the EPL;
- most likely have a lot of friends etc. in England;
- have had fans and pundits alike tear you to shreds completely undeservedly the last time you were there (Man United);
- you desperately want to prove them wrong;
- you play in a club which is falling apart before your eyes (even if it did help you immensely).

Then you get offered
- the chance to shut English people's mouths about you by steamrolling their league
- while challenging for trophies and competing at the highest level
- and earning enough money to suit you comfortably for the rest of your life with careful financial management.

Or you stay at Inter and watch everything you fought for for the past 2 years fall apart around you.

What would you choose? And after you answer that question: would you still blame Lukaku (or even sillier, his agent) for making the choice?

"I'm glad for the 2 years and the Serie A win but honestly speaking I have never warned up to the guy. There was always something off with Lukaku when I saw him play. For an elite striker he had some glaring technical limitations and did weird things at times which required basic technique. I overlooked on those because at times he scored goals and that is all that matters in football. But he had absolute stinkers including EL final, games against Juve etc where he was totally shutdown.

Lukaku used us as a stepping stone to get back to his promised league. The way he used the club like a small club in order to force a move to Chelsea in such a short time, I truly hope and wish he absolutely flops. He is always self conscious and wants to proof to his critics. He seems to have a chip in his shoulder trying to appear like an intelligent player.

I'm petty but his behaviour showed and I would love nothing more for him to flop at Chelsea again to see how much he liked his ""home"".

I want to call out those Inter fans who keep wishing him good luck after all he did to us. We are now feeder club? Someone like Lukaku disrespect us and we should be ""civil"" about it.

"That's what I'm saying but people think I'm trying to defend Suning. Suning are assholes and I hope they sell the club asap but we can't unsee the unfair behavior by Lukaku.

He was posting King of Milano shit on ig, he was calling Inter his home on twitter, he phoned Inzaghi and Marotta multiple times telling he was staying.

He did an interview on Inter TV telling he was ready for next szn and then what? He leaves us 12 days after that interview. And he's saying that he wanted to stay but simply couldn't refuse Chelsea offer. He's acting like Chelsea called him after the interview and reached an agreement with him. Like he negotiated in just 10 days. Does he expect us to believe it? C'mon.

He said everywhere that he was staying. And while he was saying it his agent was reaching an agreement with Chelsea. And he warned Marotta only when all things were done. That's what Curva has came to know. That's why Curva and all other fans are disappointed.

He was a great player for us. But he acted very unfairly in his departure, he didn't have respect for the fans and for the people he worked with, escaping and lying. I can accept that you wanna leave, but I can't accept lies and incoherence.

If you wanted to leave, the solution was simple: just ask Marotta to be sold (in June, not in August, so the club that made you who you are can actually prepare to find a replacement), and then just shut the fuck up. Don't say all that shit on social media and don't lie to Inzaghi. Just leave silently and respectfully. Is that too much to ask?",h8q94l3,p3c3io,FCInterMilan,2021-08-13 09:16:57,Lollosissimo-937,81

People said that he left because Inter is a sinking ship, originally we able to tell ourself that we are not a sinking ship mainly because the reliable captain Lukaku are here. Then he just left this sinking ship, he supposed to be the captain of this ship yet he easily went to better ship, all of this after announced publicly that he will stay, that he's king of Milan and whatever. Just shut up for once instead of making all these bullshit post.

From outside perspective of course it's a rational thing, but for Inter fans this is felt like a straight stab direct to the heart. Only one day after the rumoured bid, he already considering to left. 1 bid just 2 weeks before the season starts. It's frustrating


I recognize him as a no bullshit guy but this transfer really makes his reputation went down in my eyes",h864it8,p0ephn,FCInterMilan,2021-08-08 21:59:54,Rezorblade,11
"I respectfully disagree. I will miss him. He was the key person in the squad that united us. The way he celebrated with his team mates (I vividly remember how Esposito would run to him when he would score) showed how respected he was in that team. He did his job fantastically and proved to silence a lot of critics (I wasn‚Äôt too crash hot about him either at the beginning when he signed). He made us forget all about the Icardi saga. 

I think this whole thing is an absolute shit show. He should have more respect and he should stay, but honestly it looks like it‚Äôs an amount we can‚Äôt refuse. All the Suning talk aside, covid has truly royally fucked everything. I think he has unfinished business in the EPL and think he‚Äôs going to thrive at his dream club.

"Imagine you are among the top 5 players in the world (any sport) and you are given the following choice: 

1. play for the club who just won the Champion's League (or equivalent for other sports), being showered with money, sponsors and most likely winning the League (or some other trophy) again next year.

2. play for a club who is dismantling and won't even pass the group stage of Champion's league, let alone finish top 4 in the next league

which one would you choose? 

It seems you guys started following football yesterday: these players are professionals, they don't ""love"" any club, they love playing football and winning trophies.

I mean what do you expect him to do once the club accepted the offer? refuse to sign with Chelsea? that's just dumb. The club wanted to sell and he didn't exactly opposed to moving.

"I disagree. While it clearly comes out like this, Lukaku seemed as engaged as ever, training hard for the new season before he even came back from vacation. And training with the squad he was usual Lukaku. A hard worker and a leader.  


Put yourself in his shoes. All you hear all summer from our management is that Lukaku would never be touched, that after Hakimi no other big player would leave, and that no amount of money would be enough to get him. That he's the cornerstone and centerpiece of the future.   
Then on one summer sunny day, you hear that Inter is engaged in talks to sell you and has given the green light to your agent to find a personal agreement. I would feel lied to and betrayed by my employer (who by the way has been 5 months behind schedule on wage payments the whole time).  
Per Fabrizio Romano (fair to say we can believe every word he says on these topics), Lukaku was ok leaving if and only if Inter was willing to sell him and the two clubs would find an agreement. It's not like he was pushing to leave. And he's not a shy one when it comes to that. He was pushing hard to leave Everton for ManU and Manu for Inter.  


We believed Marotta and thought Conte was just being a dick. We actually never heard a single word from our spoiled kid president. He arrived, took pictures with the trophy for his Instagram, said ""Inter is here, I M Scudetto, we are here to stay at the top"" and then left.   


You tend to disregard most summer rumors, but it all makes perfect sense now. The ownership mandated that every player, for which a good offer would arrive, would be sold. End of story. It comes to no surprise that they were doing underground talks for Lautaro too for more than a week now. Most probably the reason why his agent was at the HQ reportedly to sign the new contract and that eventually never happened.   


I hope this is it with selling players and that Marotta &amp; Ausilio can pull off some magic to salvage the squad with the spare change they are given. But we'll see at the end of the mercato session what players we have left.   


And I want to say it one last time to all. *Stop buying the ""Covid fucked us"" narrative*. Covid was there for everyone. **Suning shadiness, lies, mismanagement, empire-building mentality, putting their own personal interest before the interest of the club fucked us.**",h86ecpx,p0ephn,FCInterMilan,2021-08-08 23:22:12,Jasonmilo911,3

"Inter hasn't even paid several months of salaries yet... Imagine working in a company and not getting a salary for 6 months, would you really want to stay there? Then they start selling their  best business sections... it feels like a sinking ship, with great uncertainties in the future. So, it's legitimate that he would leave in such circumstances, even if his first choice was to stay.

Definitely agree on your point that Lukaku didn't show up in important games. I think he wasn't the perfect striker, he was amazing in certain situations like with big open spaces to run to (except with strong physique defenders e.g. chiellini) but in other situations where the spaces were tight and he has to play with the team he was a non-factor IMO, not like Ibrahimovic style. So, in the technical aspects we could get better players and maybe we overrated him a little bit. For me the biggest loss, are his mental qualities, he was a leader on many levels within inter that really brought the players together...also great penalty taker and by far our best finisher! 

Also, his heading qualities were surprisingly not so strong for such a big guy, I think he scored only 2 header goals in the whole season!",h86ik5v,p0ephn,FCInterMilan,2021-08-08 23:55:40,SteffiGee,-2
"Yes, I feel that the blame has been put exclusively on Suning and that is not exactly fair. Not that they don't deserve to be berated for the way they are handling this situation, but let's not forget where we were before Suning. Lukaku always could have said no to the offer and see how the season goes, I think we had a really good shot at retaining the title with him in the squad. Instead, he chose to go where the grass is greener, and being 28 and in top form, and being wanted by the european champion, I don't blame him for accepting the offer, but please let him spare us the 'im an interista' bullshit. There are several interistas in the squad, and Lukaku certainly isn't one of them.

I also feel that he wants to go back because he feels like he has something to prove, both to Chelsea and to United, so...

Anyway, the club is always bigger than any one player, so forza Inter and I hope we have a nice season ahead and make the most of it. I still feel that we have a realistic chance of retaining the title.",h8898hj,p0ephn,FCInterMilan,2021-08-09 08:08:27,Dangthe,1

"I hesitated to post this because the feeling around a lot of fans is Suning forced Lukaku out and anyone who disagrees is a Suning fanboy.

But whether you like it or not this is the situation, all the reliable sources have stated the same throughout this saga, Lukaku didn't want to force a move out but he wanted to go Chelsea, Suning didn't want to force him out but they weren't gonna say no to  Chelsea's final offer.

It's like I said, Lukaku and Suning had this weird ""I m not gonna force a move but I m not gonna say no either"", bottom line is both of them didn't make the slightest effort to stay together. I don't blame Lukaku tbh because Chelsea have a better project, they just won the UCL and on top of that they are doubling his salary. I don't blame Suning for accepting the bid because they need the money but I blame them for the financial situation and the fact that we have gotten to this point, having to sell of our best players in order to keep the club running and not only that but the 180m we get from the sales, only 50m will be reinvested, that's not acceptable at all and shows you how bad of a situation we are in. If they can't keep the club running (and that's how it looks like at the moment), they should sell asap.

As for Lukaku, all that stuff he said about staying and king of Milano is now meaningless, and fans say that we should be grateful to him, that's true but he should be even more grateful to Inter because before we bought him, his career was going down the drain and we spent 80m on him, Conte and the players and the fans with their love and support have transformed him completely and he's now a much much much better player. If it weren't for us, only god knows where he would be right now.

While Suning takes the blame for all of this financial situation, if Lukaku wanted to stay, he could have very easily stayed, again I m not blaming him for abandoning a club in difficulty to join a better club and with a better project, just saying. If he really wanted to stay he could have stayed simple as that.

If there's anyone to be applauded in this case, it's Marotta, he's our top player and without him we crumble.

"Tough times ahead.  A lot of bad signs before this.

Here are the facts:
1.  Suning has financial difficulties.  Jiansu Suning disbanded after winning the league.  The players didn't get paid.  Suning owed Alibaba a lot of money.
2. Even if Suning managed to raise money for the club, they can't transfer it out of China because the government disallows it.
3. The club borrows money from Oaktree.  Before that the club delayed wage payments to Inter players by a few months.
4.  The stadium was closed.  No money coming in.

Yes, Conte is a great coach, sad that he left. But he was asking to much money. Hakimi was great but he left.

But new sponsor pays more. Yet again, in this season its vital.

If Lukaku leaves,  that is a big hit for fans. But great income for club. I don't think that they will invest all of transfer money this season in Suning company, that's stupid.

The thing is, Lukaku won't be the final one. He is the start of a Domino effect. Hakimi was sold to balance the books. Lukaku is being pushed out as the start of a dismantling project for Suning to make as much money as possible from a scudetto winning team. The objective of Suning was never to build on this team. It was to win the scudetto, increase the value of the players, and then sell them for profit in Suning's books. They are a scam.

"I wouldnt be surprised if Inzaghi resigns too right now.

He signed his contract agreeing to ONE big name sale (99% knowing it was hakimi) and now they are selling Lukaku who said multiple times he's staying and god knows who else will want to leave after Lukaku does.

I don't see players staying motivated that much when your two main stars of the team get sold like that. Lautaro already expressed interest in moving to spain, brozo's contract is expiring next year and so on

"I don't get how ANYONE here can defend Suning.  

This club is at a vital point in it's current history.  We have/had a squad that is built to win.  We had a coach (mind you some of the things he did were backwards) with a winning pedigree.  A team manager that bleeds black and blue, and we had just won a scudetto, not by a small margine but a large one.  We had all the tools to truly become dominate for many years.

We have an owner that has borrowed far to much (they have $4.5b outstanding local and off-shore bonds maturing at the end to the year + Oaktree + are getting sued in China), and their refusal to even entertain offers for the club, all the while forcing staff out because they speak out, forcing players out for revenue and yet people here are defending them.  IMHO, I don't care that we won the Scudetto.  Congrats.  The Inter of old would build upon that success with not dismantle the club in order to avoid personal bankruptcy.

Mark my words, Lukaku will NOT be the last player sold before Zhang (can't call it Suning anymore) are gone.  Steven is the head of the international division and they don't even know if the board of Suning will keep him.

At WHAT fucking point did Zhang say to himself, ""Gee, we haven't made any money due to COVID so lets open 250 stores across China, and not recall the loan on Evergrand because who needs that money?""

Mourinho flat out said without Oriali, Inter doesn't win a treble.  He was so vital to that team that 10 mins into his first talk with him Mourinho knew they had to do whatever it takes to keep him.

Fine sell Lukaku, keep the guy that has been refusing to resign since last year because you know, he wants to stay...

"La Gazzetta just published this [article](https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Calciomercato/Inter/05-08-2021/inter-calciomercato-lukaku-rilancio-chelsea-marotta-inzaghi-contrari-420190668424.shtml?cmpid=shortener_30d4596cos), I m not italian but I can understand it a little, I'll try to summarize it and feel free to correct or add anything. La Gazzetta is not as reliable as Sky but they have been pretty spot on lately so I don't know. 

The report basically says that Lukaku has been tempted by the Chelsea approach and their ambitious project, and he has spoken in the past few days to Inzaghi and the board and he told them that he wishes to go to Chelsea, Marotta and Ausilio and Inzaghi are against this move, Marotta believes he can attain the objective that was asked by the ownership for this summer without having to sell Lukaku. Zhang however will not say no and he will accept the 130m offer from Chelsea. The first choice if he leaves is Vlahovic who will be hard to get depending on Fiorentina and how much of that 130m will be invested, the alternative is Zapata. Marotta is concerned about how much will the budget be for the replacement. 

The situation remains the same, Lukaku wouldn't force a move but he wouldn't say no to an ambitious Chelsea project, and the ownership won't force him out but they are tempted and won't say no to 130m. The only new thing here is that Marotta is against selling him even if he wishes to go to Chelsea.",h7qv1l3,oy02k4,FCInterMilan,2021-08-05 08:29:11,Lothar18,3
"I have been discussing this Lukaku deal here and with friends for the past 48 hours, I should give myself a break. But first, why has everyone concluded and believed that the ownership forced Lukaku out and are trying to pin this on him to make it look like he wanted to leave ? It seems that a lot of fans hate Suning and they blame them for everything without hesitating and without taking a minute to analyze and talk about it.  


I just don't get it, there's absolutely no substance to it, and the club has already declined 2 offers and 1 of them was a 100m offer. You can blame Suning for having to lose Lukaku, but why do you have to go beyond that and paint them as these big baddies who are forcing Lukaku out and manipulating his image ? I m not taking any sides here, I m just trying my best to be objective and analyze this situation.  


All that is going on now is speculation mostly against the ownership because well the majority of fans now hate them. You can also speculate that Chelsea had an agreement with Lukaku and then they approached Inter, I mean is that impossible ? In all transfer deals, personal terms are agreed first and then the negotiations between clubs start, and how can Chelsea make a 100m bid if the player doesn't want to join them in the first place ? may be Lukaku did not believe in our project anymore after losing Hakimi and Conte and not making any reinforcements, or may be he just liked the Chelsea project better, and their project is better since they can splash 100m whenever they feel like it to improve the team, I mean is that really impossible to believe ? the only reason no one will agree with this is because they hate the ownership and they blame them for everything. Lukaku really loves Chelsea, he has said that numerous times, he has fired his agent Raiola in the past because he didn't inform him about Chelsea's interest in him.

 Again I m not taking any sides and I don't believe all this speculation that I just wrote above, I m just making the point that all that is going on right now is speculation, and people believe whatever aligns with how they feel. I m absolutely not siding with the ownership, What I believe now is that the club didn't do enough to keep Lukaku as soon as they heard about the 130m offer, and Lukaku also didn't do enough to stay after he was approached by Chelsea, who have a much better project than us. Both Lukaku and the club had this weird ""I m not gonna force a move but I m not gonna say no either"" and this is what Romano, Di Marzio and all the reliable journalists said about this.

I think we should all wait for a little while to see if more information comes out in the next few days, and even if no info comes out, we will find out everything based on how much of that 130m Suning is gonna reinvest in the team. Then we can take a side.",h7qp7rh,oy02k4,FCInterMilan,2021-08-05 07:43:06,Lothar18,7

"This would have been great if it happened at the start of the window.  80M toward the debt and 50M to buy Vlahovic.  Keep Hakimi and then we're running it back with basically the same team.

Unfortunately that's not the reality, but I do think it's okay to be optimistic still.  For Inter to actually climb back to the top in Europe, we have to make these smart market decisions and Marotta is largely doing that.  Selling Lukaku and Hakimi is awful.  Buying two players for a combined 120M, winning the scudetto, and then flipping them for an 80M profit is good business.  It's okay to be upset and disappointed by this window but it's also okay to be hopeful that maybe we're actually going to make good market decisions unlike almost everything in the 2010s.",h7qgghg,oy02k4,FCInterMilan,2021-08-05 06:35:03,Fuzzydeath10,14

How anyone can defend this move is beyond me. We‚Äôve moved to an inferior manager, moving to an inferior forward and an inferior wing back. All this in order to paper over the business mistakes made by a company who, as of yet, has made no effort to explain to the supporters why they are doing what they are doing.

Obviously, the bid was more for Rom, but if Suning is just trying to recoup money by selling big names then why not sell Barella? I feel like there has been longer negotiations between Inter and Chelsea going on, they are just now being talked about in the press cause Rom is back and they probably approached him about it to see what his thoughts were once he was back in Milan.

There's a beautiful girl wanted and courted by everyone. She begins a relationship with a quite famous guy, a plastic relashionship.

She knows a new guy, a guy who helps her find herself again and their relationship is stronger than ever. She is very happy, the guy loves her with all his heart and it seems like nothing could go wrong.




The girl is beautiful again, and everyone starts to look at her again. She at first swears love to the guy she's in love with, but when her ex comes to the door she thinks for a second and then wants to get back with him, even if he treated her like shit the last time.




The girl is Lukaku, the first boyfriend is Man U but in general the PL and we are the bounce back guy.




Lukaku used us as his bounce back. I'm happy he brought us a scudetto, but I cant say that I'll have some respect to him after his last ig post.




We are inter, we aren't a fuckin bounce back team, we are the team where the players play at their fucking peaks.

And now here we are 2 years later, Lukaku leaving and Zapata coming in and the feeling has totally changed. 

Zapata is a very good player no doubt about that, the problem is he is old and has no resale value and we will definitely struggle to offload him in the near future.

Of course we all expected a downgrade from last season because of all the Covid mess, but this feels like dismantling the whole squad and it‚Äôs not looking good at all. At least I hope that these 200M (mostly used compensate our financial situation) will be used to build something in the long term rather than to settle only for the next season. I smell banter era.

I have zero faith in the team and company, i am afraid these 130Mil will be just oxygen for the Zhang family and we will end up like 2012 where we went from 1st to 2nd to 6th spot in the league.",h7nay7y,oxizsa,FCInterMilan,2021-08-04 13:53:01,anitalianguy,36

"If Lukaku leaves, the only acceptable solution is to buy a young replacement who's good now but also with high potential, 3 names pop into my head, Isak, Vlahovic and Schick.

"I am confident that it wont happen. Too much to lose and little to gain.

1. That quick money is hard to reinvest now with little time to the start of the season. Cant remake a team now with 3 weeks to start. Had to happen at the start of the market. We would be unable to really make good use of this money until next summer.

2. The team is winning with proven schemes and tactics, it only makes sense to change a player with a similar one and there is no other Lukaku type on the market barring Haaland who is unreachable.

3. Within this tactics, Lukaku is more than pivotal. Literally the most important player in the team as engine, support and attack. 

4. The brand would suffer, international appeal and sponsorships also come thanks to Lukaku. That is a steady flow of money that only a purchase like Haaland or Messi would improve.

5. The cost of possibly underperforming this season is too high. Loss on CL money, loss of brand value, loss of further players. Hardly worth the 130 bid.

-----

6. On the other hand, if the money can be invested as part of the costs for a future stadium, it would be a good investment which pays off over time. 

7. Negotiations could bring someone good in. Say Timo Werner on top of 130 millions would not throw us too much under the bus.",h7m7anb,oxd9uk,FCInterMilan,2021-08-04 07:52:15,afg500,3

"If you sell Lukaku you are openly admitting that you don't want to win, you just want money to survive. What will the players think when you sell your best player 2 weeks before the championship starts?
At this point Lautaro will just not renew his contract and leave next summer because everyone understood that the project ended. And poor Inzaghi, media and fans will throw a lot of shit on him but he has no responsibility for the shit season that we're about to make. He really doesn't deserve this.

Suning has to leave, not in 3 yrs, not in x months, they have to leave NOW. If you can't mantain a top level club you have to leave, as simple as that.
Tell me everything about loving your club unconditionally, tell me that I'm overreacting (probably I am), but I can't and I don't want to support a club that doesn't want to win.
If you sell Lukaku, Hakimi, fail to convince Conte and Oriali to stay, it means that you are making zero efforts to win. I can't accept it. I can accept a club that tries to win and fails, but I can't accept a club that sells their best player 2 weeks before the championship starts, it means you don't really care anymore.

And please, don't tell me that you can't refuse such an offer, because in August 130 mln are useless. You can't buy any big player in August. 
Who can you buy? Vlahovic? C'mon the kid has talent but he didn't demonstrate absolutely nothing yet. How can he replace a top 5 expert player such as Lukaku?

And what I hate the most is that me and many other fans have tried our best to defend the club we love from the shit tons that media and other fans were throwing at us. And then they do this. They are basically giving reason to all those clowns that insulted us.

Unfortunately after covid outbreak, Suning only wanted money to float and decided that winning is not a priority anymore. I would have accepted this if I was a fan of Sassuolo or smth. But I can't accept it as an Inter fan, if you're Inter you play to win no matter what and you make all that you can to keep the team competitive.
