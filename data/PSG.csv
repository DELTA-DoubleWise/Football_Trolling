Rerel,1599277773.0,imugfm,15.0,1.0,"Welcome to the 2020 edition of our transfer reliability guide update thread.  

For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the concept, the goal here is very simple. Re-evaluate what happened since the last update and adjust the tiers of journalists and media where necessary, according of course on how reliable they have been in reporting transfer rumors. Additionally, you are welcome to suggest new additions to the list, as long as the journalist is relevant to our club.


----

**https://psg-reddit.github.io**

This is our current transfer reliability guide, you can use it as a starting point. Then in this thread I will create a top level comment for each Tier (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) under which you can post your suggestions for tier switches, new additions and so on. You don't have to limit yourself to a single journalist or media, it can be a list of those if you like.


And since the main focus of this endeavor is to reach as unanimous as possible community-driven consensus on who is reliable or not, it goes without saying that you are also encouraged to engage in discussion with other user's proposals, whether you agree, disagree or want to clarify something.


Well, that's about it, the concept is pretty clear. If you are unsure about something, you can check last year thread's on PSG sources reliability:

**https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/c21pux/here_is_my_attempt_at_a_paris_saintgermain/**

You can stop reading here, but just a quick word on the tiers and what they represent. Since the last update the number has increased from 4 to 5 total, to have a slightly more detailed outlook when reading the guide.

- **Tier 1**: As close as it gets to receiving the news from an official source. You can guarantee that the information presented is verified and coming from a reputable source, not just speculation.


- **Tier 2**: By no means a bad source, just a level below Tier 1. Information shared by the source can be seen as trustworthy, just not as much as Tier 1.


- **Tier 3**: We're entering the hit and miss, 50/50 territory here. Source might have some insider information, but might as well have a rich history of wrong reports. You wouldn't trust them by all means, information could very well be false. Critical reader discretion and common sense here is strongly advised.


- **Tier 4**: Untrustworthy journalists or media sources who could occasionally be right once in a while, but usually not the case. clickbait, sensational titles and so on.


- **Tier 5**: This is the worst tier reserved for media and so called journalists which are only interested in clickbait and have no insight or credibility whatsoever.


The tier definitions are open for discussion if someone disagrees with them or has different interpretations or ideas for them.",psg,/r/PSG Transfer Reliability Guide update thread - 2020 edition.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/imugfm/rpsg_transfer_reliability_guide_update_thread/,2020-09-05 11:49:33

ImNotARobotFOSHO,1603372434.0,jfzdpf,25.0,1.0,"We should move on after the embarassing defeat against Man Utd, but I see many talks about the end of a cycle being this season of the next. The results this season will determine the destiny of the club for the following years.

Here are the hot topics in my opinion:

\- **Extending Mbapp√© and Neymar**. They've been disappointing lately, but I'm pretty sure the question of their future at the club (or not) is impacting their performance.

\- **Improving midfield**. Danilo and Rafinha may help, it's too early to judge. If they don't, then the managers will have to go all in. I personally would like to see Camavinga joining the club.

\- If Icardi doesn't improve / gets back to his early 2019/2020 level, then PSG has to consider **signing a top class center forward** (Haaland is a personal favorite, he's a warrior).

\- Another batch of **expiring contracts**.  
[https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-paris-saint-germain/vertragsende/verein/583](https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-paris-saint-germain/vertragsende/verein/583)  
What to do with Di Maria and Draxler? Di Maria is getting older but he's still kicking and has his moments. Draxler has been a ghost for a long time, and showed signs of improvements lately.  
I don't think we should hesitate to extend Bernat.

\- It's still early, but **Tuchel's contract is also expiring**. Many fans (me included) are very angry at him, but he won't get fired, unless he maintains the downward spiral he's put the squad into. I can really imagine Leonardo having a post-Tuchel plan already prepared, with Allegri as the new coach. Not sure he could do much better than Tuchel, but who knows.

\- This subject has been lengthily discussed in here, but after the Man Utd game it acts as a reminder at how manager have been spending money to build a competitive team. I've been blaming Tuchel for a while for his constant non-sense, but we shouldn't forget that **management also has a huge part of responsibility**.

Not trying to kick at an open door, but I found this picture on [culturepsg.com](https://culturepsg.com), shoutout to the user [**Verratticardimaria**](https://disqus.com/by/James12000/) for sharing it.

Anyways, I don't understand Tuchel choices it's been 1 year that I don't get him. Either the game plan is weak or the players aren't used in their best position.

mykneehurtsss,1601932902.0,j5s700,18.0,1.0,"Inter fan here who‚Äôs watches every Inter game of the last 15 years - although you may feel underwhelmed by this transfer or you may be saying the best thing he will bring is his Brazilian connection with Neymar, one big important thing you may be missing is the fact that Rafinha has great chemistry with Icardi. While only playing with us for 6 months, Rafinha was the added creative spark that helped give Icardi many more scoring opportunities during those 6 months where we went on to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in many years. Icardi was the leagues top goalscorer that year with 29 goals. Icardi was famous for not having much creative support during his years with us so Rafinha made a huge impact on his play. 

We signed both Rafinha and Cancelo on loan that season but decided not to spend our money on making their loans permanent, even though they both helped create more chances for Icardi and helped us qualify for Europe that year. I honestly think the club not permanently signing these two players contributed in part to Icardi becoming disgruntled the following season which then slowly led to his relationship with the club deteriorating and thus led to his transfer. 

Besides his chemistry with Icardi, Rafinha also showed more emotion and desire to fight for our club in the 6 months he was here than other players did who‚Äôve been with us for longer. Our fans still love him and wish he‚Äôd come back to us. So if I was a PSG fan, I would feel more excited for his arrival!",psg,Major thing you guys may be missing about this Rafinha transfer,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/j5s700/major_thing_you_guys_may_be_missing_about_this/,2020-10-06 05:21:42

It wasn't the first time that I've heard someone question is temperament so I was wondering if anyone could kindly offer some insight on this?

pougliche,1605958137.0,jy99va,29.0,1.0,"For 20+ years i've been watching our team win and lose a lot of games, being robbed, sometimes having luck with referees or whatever, I used to not care about all that aspect of the game.

But now with VAR, it seems every game there's something fishy going on. Penalty kicks are being offered for kicking the ball in the opponent's hand. You can't celebrate any goal you see until you watched 3 replays that guarantee there's not any way it will be canceled. Goals are being disallowed for offside that don't exist despite the people in the VAR room having multiple angle and possibility of taking 2 or 3 full minute to check. Players are being sent off as watching slow motion replay makes any tackle look bad. Some refs even invent rules just to prevent us from winning it seems (remember the penalty kick gained by Icardi against Real Madrid, that was cancelled for a ""foul"" in midfield 30 seconds prior, a one time thing in the world of football) . 

It has become tiring to follow football with all these dubious things happening. Without VAR, I was inclined to think about honest mistakes and human error, that's why I never would have complained about that before. But now, how else are we supposed to think about what happens? 

Last night, can somebody offers a better explanation than ""refs didn't want to kill Monaco""? When they have all the technology and possibilities of not making mistake and still do, isn't it obvious for us to think it's biased, as there's not other logical explanation? 

I stopped watching the game after the Kean goal was disallowed, and laughed my ass off when seeing the end result ""PSG collapsed"" FFS how do you even talk about collapse when half the goals you score are cancelled randomly? 

Anyway, sorry for the rant but I just can't stand it anymore, I stopped watching for a while after PSG-MU, not because of the disappointment of losing, but because it was fucking bullshit and that we were told bullshit was gone thanks to VAR after the so called remontada (easier to accomplish those things when you've got at least 5 major ref decisions completely changing the game, but that's another story), I don't think I want to continue following this mascarade when we're in an age with so many medias, shows, podcast or videogames to spend time with. I don't know about you, but I really think FIFA and UEFA (should call them MAFIA) managed to kill football for me. (not to mention a lot of other factors, but that one takes the cake)

Let me get this out of the way : I don‚Äôt care that he got us to the final, let‚Äôs be honest BVB atalanta and Leipzig aren‚Äôt Real Liverpool city juve Barca or whatever, and his coaching didn‚Äôt have to do with anything.

It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm genuinely concerned that he‚Äôs crashing us to the ground on purpose to get fired and get that sweet money.

We‚Äôve had coaches that I didn‚Äôt agree with but this is just a level of absurd I‚Äôve never seen at our club. 

He is the worst coach of QSI history on paper, he has a worst record than Emery, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned he did EVERYTHING wrong :
Recruiting, tactics, in game coaching, Marqui/Danilo, his press conferences, everything.

For real just sack him already we are going to end up in Europa league so at least let‚Äôs try to win it, which we won‚Äôt with Tuchel.

(posted with permission from the mod team)

Hey guys. Me and a couple of guys just starting a little PS4 FIFA 21 community. Based in Europe, Northern Africa &amp; Turkey.

Our idea is to organise tournaments. Over the next 2 weeks, we're doing our first tournament.

We're starting small. The idea was to have an 8 player tournament. 2 groups of 4 teams, but at the least moment we had a drop-out.

So we're looking for at least one replacement who's willing to play 3 to 5 matches.

Rules are simple. Like the World Cup, but with Club teams and only 8. With a max rating of 4 stars.

If you're interested. DM me Or join up at [https://discord.gg/zkS8uWeGNn](https://discord.gg/zkS8uWeGNn)

Notre id√©e est d'organiser des tournois. Au cours des 2 prochaines semaines, nous organisons notre premier tournoi.

Nous commen√ßons petit. L'id√©e √©tait d'organiser un tournoi √† 8 joueurs. 2 groupes de 4 √©quipes, mais au moins nous avons eu un abandon.

Nous recherchons donc au moins un rempla√ßant pr√™t √† jouer 3 √† 5 matchs.

Les r√®gles sont simples. Comme la Coupe du monde, mais avec des √©quipes de club et seulement 8. Avec une note maximale de 4 √©toiles.

Therefore, every time I hear critiques against Tuchel, it usually has something to do on how he didnt make a tactical change (or were too late to do it). Maybe due to his position, the fact that players usually get a lot of the credit, and people tend to criticize more than compliment; I dont really read much of him getting credit for a right sub, right start up, or line up. Does it not happen? Another thing, maybe I just dont read as much, but I dont hear our players talking that much about him either.

But even before this incident, the match was just horrible. There was nothing to be happy about, Keylor made some saves like the god he is, Bakker had a solid game defensively, if he could offer something going forward I‚Äôd be pretty happy with him. Presco was dogshit, and I am finding myself questioning his readiness to captain in absence of Marqui, who was dearly missed. Danilo shouldn‚Äôt play in defense, he had some good clearances especially in the air but his build play is non existent. Verratti had one of his worst games in recent memory, but he will bounce back, Di Maria on the other hand seems down for a few weeks now, Rafinha from the start should have been the move. Neymar wasn‚Äôt as focused in comparison to the CL game, Kean was a complete min factor. Aside from bad individual performances, something about this team doesn‚Äôt seem right in 2/3 of the games. Maybe it‚Äôs the formations or tactics, or just the team chemistry with Tuchel, but something drastic needs to change.

Everyone going to reply and say hes a snake etc, but you know they catered for mbappe and neymar so of course cavani wasnt going to resign.

I hope this team enjoys replacing a dependable, classic and experienced striker, for an injured striker and potential wonderkid.

HugoChinaski,1610321629.0,kupzre,41.0,2.0,"
I hear you guys talking about selling Mbappe this year, and that would be absolutely catastrophic for us. 

The main issue for me is that we wouldn‚Äôt sell him for more than 130m‚Ç¨, since he only has one year left. Also it‚Äôs Covid times so the market seems to be a bit lower than it used to, big clubs don‚Äôt have that much money. 

Selling him for ¬´¬†only¬†¬ª that amount would be really really bad business, having paid him 180m‚Ç¨, and him being one of the biggest prospects in world football. 

And if we don‚Äôt sell him this summer it‚Äôs even worse cuz then he goes for free next year and that would be a real shame and basically be the worst trade deal in the history of deals.

Here‚Äôs why, in my humble opinion, we absolutely need to sign an extension, wether we want to keep him or not.",psg,"It‚Äôs been bugging me for a while, but we desperately need to sign an extension for Mbappe.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/kupzre/its_been_bugging_me_for_a_while_but_we/,2021-01-11 07:33:49
UCLAlex,1610318138.0,kuovpp,37.0,1.0,"Honestly I like kean and he‚Äôs been great but ‚Ç¨35 million is way too much. I think we should go all in for Depay for free, or even now since JMA said he could let him go for 5 million. Memphis has all the same qualities as Kean, but better technically (dribbling and ball control, not finishing where I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty equal) and is much, much more experienced. We‚Äôll see how kean plays in the UCL knockouts, but I doubt he starts over icardi, and spending 35 mill on a rotation player is dumb. Memphis can also play on the wings which we‚Äôll need when di Maria and draxler probably leave at the end of the year. I also don‚Äôt doubt Memphis will integrate into the squad we‚Äôll since I think he‚Äôs already friends with Neymar and a few others. If we need a rotation striker for ligue 1 we can use kalimuendo who‚Äôll come back at the end of the season. If we can get kean for less than 25 million which is highly unlikely I‚Äôd maybe go for it but we need to use the money on other priorities.

BVB fan here.   
I hope this hasnt been discussed around here already.   
There are lots of discussions among BVB fans concerning Meunier's shocking perfomances he's had for us. Honestly it's quite unbelievable how bad he's been playing for us, not rarely one could have the impression a random stranger has been picked from the streets and put into the team. His ball control is atrocious, he's playing catastrophic bad passes and is all in all shaky in almost every of his actions. 

This of course comes as a suprise considering he was a regular for you guys and is obviously  favoured by Favre (and now Terzic) to be a starter, although we admittedly have a serious lack of alternatives on this position.

HugoChinaski,1613636083.0,lmhng2,12.0,1.0,"With all the rumors going about, and since at least half of you aren‚Äôt French, I thought I‚Äôd summarize quickly what‚Äôs being said in France by insiders, journalists etc.. concerning Mbappe‚Äôs extension :

From the looks of it, it‚Äôs pretty simple : he wants to stay, but he is afraid of signing a new 4 or 5 year deal because he know Paris can refuse to let him go at some point. 

He doesn‚Äôt necessarily want to be at Real next year, he could do one or two years in Paris, but Paris have a reputation of not letting players leave, or at least making it very hard for them to do so. 

That‚Äôs supposedly why he has been reluctant. He‚Äôs scared of being stuck in Paris until he‚Äôs 27. 

If we were in another country, we could add a clause in the contract that says that after 2023, he can leave whenever he wants (like Messi had) but it‚Äôs illegal in France to do so.

So this is why the latest rumors have been talking about a one or two years extension, pushed by Mbappe‚Äôs clan. 

Of course this is just a summary of rumors I‚Äôve heard, it might be all wrong but this information have been consistent over the past weeks, wether it‚Äôs reporters or insiders of podcasters etc..

Let‚Äôs hope they find a deal.
And let‚Äôs hope he realizes at some point that Real, Barca etc.. are in the past and that PSG is the future!!",psg,Why Mbappe‚Äôs clan doesn‚Äôt want to sign an extension.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/lmhng2/why_mbappes_clan_doesnt_want_to_sign_an_extension/,2021-02-18 16:14:43

Not to mention mbappe,icardi and Kean and if we can get draxler at his best (2017 flashbacks) we are good to go. Even the barca defense is injured.

Also koeman is really poor with tactics. Poch's tactics can easily be the decider. If poch does his homework he can get through this. 

Many people are speaking about the alaves thumping, well they did it even in 2017 with a 6-0 and then lost 4-0. Also Barca is yet to win any match against the top 4 of Laliga.

Translation: ""The sadness is great, the pain is immense, and the crying is constant. Once again I will stop for a while to do what I love most in life, which is to play soccer. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because of my style of play, because I dribble and end up getting caught constantly, I don't know if the problem is me or what I do on the field? It makes me too sad to have to listen to players, coaches, commentators, or whatever the fuck ""he has to be beaten"" ""he should be beaten"" ""he is a whiner"" ""a brat"" ""spoiled"" and etc ...
Honestly this saddens me and I do not know how long I can take it, I just want to be happy playing soccer. NOTHING MORE

MarginOfCorrectness,1615854648.0,m5wgjj,61.0,2.0,"Given how many of you are super reactive and writing comments such as ""we played better under Tuchel"", I have to wonder how many of you watched our games before January 2021. Because if you think we were playing better before Poche, I don't think we were watching the same team.

&amp;#x200B;

\- We have had so many dreadful matches in Ligue 1 that were saved by a genius move of Neymar in the last minute. It was happening a lot last season and was still the case this year.

\- In the CL, remember how we lost to United at home and RB? And we actually got very fortunate to come back from Turkey with the W? Have you all forgotten how we went through thanks to a dive of ADM against RB that gave us a non-existent penalty? Or how United should have been up 3-1 at home. Instead, we got lucky they missed big chances and we then scored and won. So if you're thinking that Tuchel would have done better against Barca, please provide your evidence. By setting us up to play more directly, we were able to score 4 to Barca in the first leg. That wouldn't have happened with Tuchel. In the second leg, yes we got fortunate in the first half. But Tuchel got fortunate against RB and United too. My guess is with Tuchel against Barca, we never get dominated as much in the first half but we also never win the first leg 4-1.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, are we playing 10x better under Poche? No. Are we playing better? I think a little bit, some players for sure. But here's the thing I don't get about all the *Tuchel In* crowd that can't get over the fact we fired him: Do you really think we were playing better under Tuchel after 2.5 years with him? Because I sure don't. We were playing worse the longer he was our coach. That's why it was time to change.

&amp;#x200B;

Is Tuchel a bad coach? No, he's an excellent coach. But it wasn't working anymore this season. Honestly, it hasn't been working since the 1-3 defeat to United. The CL run last year hid the problems (similarly to how Germany reached the WC final in 2002 while being quite shite, mostly thanks to a lucky draw). I'm grateful we had the 2.5 years with Tuchel but it was time to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

So how about you stop being whiny babies and wait 2.5 years before judging Poche? Deal? Poche has been here for less than 3 months and hasn't even been able to rely on Neymar most of the time! What is wrong with some of you seriously? We got a guy that made us finally beat a big team in Europe and he did it without our best player! And some of you are thinking ""boohoo we lost to Nantes, I wish we had Tuchel""? Are you for real?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, yes, Tuchel is doing well at Chelsea. I'd argue that Chelsea was always a good, stacked team. They only had a bad 1-2 months. But even during those 2 months, all the stats (xG, etc) were showing a team that was playing well. What Tuchel does well is defensive set up. I'll admit that PSG's defense was better under him than under Poche.",psg,Did some of you only start watching our games in January?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/m5wgjj/did_some_of_you_only_start_watching_our_games_in/,2021-03-16 08:30:48

I think it‚Äôs the first time I see Verratti being so off during a champions league game. 

The problems kept falling on them but there was not a single sign of improvement. A lot of collective and individual issues. It felt the physical form of the players was had, maybe a mental block from both of them as well. 

I don‚Äôt think Verratti has an issue with responsibilities usually. But he clearly missed that game completely. He did run at least 11km during his playing time. 

Paredes who was becoming reliable in a long serie of games. Now he also failed completely, wasn‚Äôt giving a lot of motion. 

We didn‚Äôt feel them really calm or confident as they usually are. They both missed that game both defensively and offensively. Maybe the tactical plan was too complex for them. But I expected a lot more from Verratti in this game.

The midfield is awful, if Paredes doesn't have 10 meters in front of him with the ball, he gives the ball back and hides.

Gueye is a good (great) midfielder, but only without the ball, when he has it, he's not going to create plays.

Verratti is the only exception, and we ask way too much from him.

The fullbacks are awful (The only exception is Diallo and he's not a starter, don't know why)

I won't even talk about Icardi's lazy ass.

I know that's a lot of negativity but man that PSG side looks absolutely awful every week in Ligue 1, and if Navas wasn't there we could have lived a third nightmare after La remontada and the comeback against MU.

I really don't want to be negative, but the first leg against bar√ßa was an exception this season, and we should be afraid to face Bayern or City.

Things can change obviously, with players like Verratti, Neymar, the center backs etc. but we absolutely need to avoid injuries for the rest of the season, which seems highly unlikely.

Hi guys, I've recently made a tactical analysis on Alphonse Areola, who I believe is one of the more underrated signings in the world this season. I can't post the whole thing here so I've included a link to my article. Let me know what you guys think of him. Do check out the article through the link below as it would mean a lot to me. It is free too! Thanks.

bill220,1619679281.0,n0yqoe,17.0,1.0,"Got extremely depressed with the result. **Watched the 2nd half many times**. How could this happen ? Came up with some analysis. Posting it here. 

**Please I just watched the 2nd half.**   


**Second half start : City pressing PSG.**   


[City pressing PSG - Circles are PSG, Diamond are City](https://preview.redd.it/zxrl325n12w61.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bfc32e3aef2eb8d90d355aa46ccc359e395108c)

City came out with a distinct plan of pressing PSG using a combination of Man-marking and Space blocking. 

The diagram above shows, Gundogan on Guye, Rodri on Veratti. KDB/BSilva blocking passing lane to Paredes, Foden on Florenzi, Mahrez on Bakker, Cancel on Di Maria. 

Psg could get the ball out of the first line, But around 1/4 th pitch, Gundogan/Rodri/Cancelo were choking them. 

**\~50th Min :** **Neymar dropping down to counter press**

&amp;#x200B;

[PSG counter City press](https://preview.redd.it/eijb36xq22w61.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d621d65393ce712fca18bb58642f32b0592d9777)

PSG saw that City are choking PSG. So Ney started to drop down in the position shown in the above image (in red circle) to help. But Garcia/Stones was also following him. So it was not so easy for him to get out. It was a struggle. 

But his dropping down was helping and he was trying to combine with Di Maria/Verrati. One such event caused PSG to break City's pressing and created the chance at 55th minute, between Veratti/Mbappe. 

**Neymar/Di Maria combining**

&amp;#x200B;

[Neymar\/Di Maria combining to open up City on the right](https://preview.redd.it/gotmnffq32w61.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d5ee9c03956128eabb729e9c13a1ba026405d57)

Another move Neymar and Di Maria were doing to open up the right of City. Neymar dropping and trying to pass the ball to Di Maria. They tried it interchangeably. 

But City were very alert and they were regrouping quickly to stop them. 

**City with ball : PSG settled shape**

&amp;#x200B;

[PSG settled shape out of possession](https://preview.redd.it/vfcgv45642w61.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a2cdf4f3c601cb216ebb21cbea99f5452e7ec8)

PSG were using a 442 out of position. Veratti was close to Bernardo Silva and Mahrez. City was targeting Bakker.  City were trying some movement but it was not really working. 

**Overall strategy**

City was pressing very high. PSG was kind of using it, their strategy was to break the press and create chance for Mbappe to score. It was not a bad one, a chance was created at 55"". 

City was just trying to create immense pressure and waiting for PSG to commit mistake. They could not create much.

Two freak goals happened due to defensive errors. But this can be attributed to the relentless pressure they were put under. These defenders are playing every 3 days. It is very difficult to keep the concentration at 100% all the time. 

**What could PSG have done differently ?**

It seems there were two plays they could have done. 

1) Use Tuchel's Chelsea approach: Hold the ball among the defenders, create an extremely slow build up near around 1/2 of PSG half and wait for opening and play a log ball to Neymar/Mbappe. This would help to release the pressure on the defenders.

This was a difficult approach and needs lot of practise. And it seems Poche is not into this kind of a play. Tuchel used to use it when he was here. Did it in the Manchester United match in Old Trafford in 2019 in the pre-quarters. 

2) Hoist the ball to City's half and press vigorously. (Liverpool/Bayern approach)

The kind of play Liverpool uses and also Poche in Tottenham. This could have been done. But it was risky since the team is not ready yet to do pressing efficiently. And if City broke their press, they would open up PSG.   


Under the circumstance, Poche thought parking the bus and then trying to break City's press and make chances for Mbappe is the best way. Obviously the risk was that defense would crack. It did today. 

Against Bayern it did not. We were lucky. 

**Neymar, Mbappe bottled by Pep**

Also I think, Pep's main master stroke was to totally man-mark Neymar. Since he knew Neymar is the provider for Mbappe. 

Neymar was man marked by either Garcia/Stones/Rodri/Gundogan. They were not letting him an inch of space. Somehow Ney should have used Veratti/Di Maria to get the ball out. Maybe it would have happened. But Gueye s RED stopped it since Di Maria had to be subbed.

Mbappe was always guarded by two defender, Walker and Garcia/Stones.

However away we play better (haven‚Äôt seen every match but I think we‚Äôre better away than home). It‚Äôs not over but it showed we still have the same problem all these years. 

Our team let down their discipline yesterday after getting frustrated but they must learn to control it and not be like ‚ÄúGUEYE‚Äù üôÉ. Anyhoos I just wanted to say home games suck for us and away games are amazing for us.

Hopefully we can turn this around and play better and not have Bakker panic with passing a ball within a 5m radius :). Other than that oh well. Fingers crossed next week",psg,HOME games are worrying,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/n0y35w/home_games_are_worrying/,2021-04-29 14:03:45

KFlow99,1619018850.0,mvi3xr,8.0,1.0,"Good afternoon PSG fans all over the world, we all went through a lot in the last couple of days but thank God its over for now! To be honest with you, i wasnt totally against it, but i didnt like the format because it was meant to kill off competition and just watch the same shit ever year. I think the football world needs a 3rd european competition because it would be the only way that some mid table teams can actually achieve some glory.Unfortunately i dont work for Uefa or Fifa so my voice can‚Äôt be heard by anyone but i‚Äôd like to share my idea of how the Super League (Champions League) should really be : I think the best decision would be to make a 16 teams competition, divided in 4 groups where the strongest teams ‚Äúbattle‚Äù each other. The 16 teams should be on top of their national leagues.
I think the spots should be as mentioned : Top 2 from Ligue 1, top 2 from Serie A, top 3 from La Liga, top 3 from Bundesliga and top 4 from Premier League. We are at 14 teams so far, so the two more spots should be from the winner of Europa League and the other one should come from 3 play off matches [3rd team in France and Italy and the first team from Holland (Netherlands) and Portugal]
If in case, the winner of Europa league is one of the teams mentioned before , than that spot should come from play off matches again (4th team in Spain, 4th team in Germany and 5th team in England alongside 1st team in Scotland). If you still want me to explain my opinion and proposition (its just something in my mind, i know no one would careüòÇ) , i‚Äôll make another post with detailed explanation about Europa League and the other competition(which would be for mid table teams) 
And i‚Äôd like to hear all your opinions",psg,Super League!!,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/mvi3xr/super_league/,2021-04-21 23:27:30

Papa Perez buys hazard for 160m, a player in his last year of contract. Buys jovic and loans him. Even Mariano. So you see great business acumen.


Barcelona with Nobita have spent 500m+ in transfers and 550m+ in Messi so a billion plus and get humiliated. These people  take a bus instead of plane to save 30k eu


Manchester city. That's it lol I don't think I have to say a word more. They might not be in huge debt but we know the losses cause I don't remember a single legit sponsor that they have.


Manchester United have blown cash off their arse on falcao era, Maguire, 12m on Phil Jones per year even though he's not  on the bench, Sanchez just for starters. Also glazers took 45m in dividends during covid and losses and added to the debt.


Liverpool furloughed(asked the government to pay) their staff before the backlash.


Arsenal can't pay a fucking  dinosaur mascots  salary.


Guess who's spent the most money in the last 3 years yes our old lady with the snake juve. Psg comes 10th in that list.


Last two years psg ranks 24th in terms of expenditure and 25th just above Atalanta yes motherfucking Atalanta has spent more than us.


 Well fuck that I'm so done with the myth that we broke ffp with Neymar. Well we had a netspend of -125m that year , a better net than mu,MC, Barcelona and fucking AC MILAN.


The year we bought Mbappe officially we had a net spend of -101m, one million more than fucking FULHAM for context and lesser than Liverpool.


But yes we ruined football FFS fuck off.

The rift between Qatar and its neighbors was caused by some major key issues: 

1) Qatar backing of the Muslim Brotherhood, a grass root Sunni Islamist religious, political, and social movement which want a ""socialized Islam"", not a feudal islam (gross generalization but at then end, you see the problem ;)

2) Al Jazeera backing of the Arab Spring which was on the network 24/7. Every single counter-power faction in these countries had a voice on AlJazeera.

3) Military..Turkish base in Qatar. Oh the Saudis are soooo pissed

4) Teheran - Doha ties. They both sit on the second and third largest natural gas reserve in the world.

So the Saudis (the leading nation economically and politically in the region - and an absolute monarchy as Qatar is a constitutional one - lifted the blockade. But the UAE and Bahrain are still not lifting theirs.
Relations between UAE and Qatar are still freezing cold.

So of course Doha wouldn't mind beating Abu Dhabi and vice versa....",psg,"PSG - City, Qatar vs UAE a quick geopolitical refresher :)",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/mrjakn/psg_city_qatar_vs_uae_a_quick_geopolitical/,2021-04-16 01:15:10

96lowky,1617889575.0,mms56c,28.0,1.0,"Looking back at the game after all emotions have calmed I stay of the mindset that we played a ver efficient game. It‚Äôs crazy how the Bayern sub thinks the series is theirs because they‚Äôll have a couple players back. They‚Äôre saying that  Goretzka, Lewa (doubtful), and idk who else will save them in the second game if they get all these chances. The thing is, unlike us they‚Äôre not acknowledging they‚Äôre opponent‚Äôs additions. All of their dangerous movements came after Marqui was subbed off, our midfield was extremely dull without Verratti and Paredes, we‚Äôre even missing our fullbacks. The truth is that if both teams are at full strength, the game is gonna play just like the final and they‚Äôre gonna need a better score than 1-0 to move through. With the current 3-2 result they‚Äôre gonna have to take more risks and move more players forward to score while not leaking any goals to us. I also believe that allowing them to attack (maybe only to an extent) was sort of a game plan from Poch since we didn‚Äôt really have the midfield to go out and challenge them. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen but all I know is that all the people saying Bayern are gonna go through don‚Äôt exactly understand that we were already able to secure 3 away goals with a depleted team. Paris isn‚Äôt just Ney Mbappe and Keylor. Can‚Äôt wait till Tuesday!

AngryMichael,1617795744.0,mm0693,14.0,1.0,"Second leg against Barcelona was so stressful for me, that I couldn¬¥t bear it. It was frustrating because of our team¬¥s performance and the whole drama about it. I hope, that this game would be different, however:

* Veratti, Florenzi and others are out
* we lost on Saturday with Lille
* we play away (and overcoming a 3:0 deficit might be very challenging, but I hope it wouldn¬¥t come to that)
* it¬¥s Bayern and even with Lewa¬¥s and Gnabry¬¥s absence, they are a big threat
* it doesn¬¥t look like our defense is as solid as during Tuchel management (although i don¬¥t know the exact numbers, but lately i¬¥ve been having strokes everytime we got dispossesed) - and you can see that in Kimpembe (own goal during France vs Ukraine game, yes, I know it wasn¬¥t his fault, but surely it must have some impacted him)

Don¬¥t take me wrong, I want to support our team, but I got used to winning. Yes, we are capable, but enduring 90+ minutes of.. something like this.. it¬¥s a challenge for everyone with weak heart.

Inte24,1617703529.0,ml895j,60.0,1.0,"Ik alot of us aren't too optimistic especially after the lille results and covid. Even I had my head down after hearing about florenzi yesterday.

But I do think we still have a chance and UCL is known for its upsets. Who knows it better than us. We are the underdogs and we can pull it off.

Last season we were missing verratti,had an injured Mbapp√©, had a midfield of Herrera and paredes, yet it was so close we could have even won , rightfully so(the xG difference was just 0.21 if I remember correct). The only goal we conceded came from a mistake. Not to mention last year's Bayern were something else and they have even fallen to an extent.

Poch has a huge job and he knows well how to get the best of his squad. If he does his hw (which he did show he is capable of against Barca first leg especially) we can edge past.


Bayern have had an extremely shaky defense all season long. They  lost to some second division , drew to Arminia Bielefeld and lost to Frankfurt, not to mention the close scrapes of 1-0 and that's just about this year.

I even luckily watched their games against Lazio and most of the goals were mistakes from Lazio especially the first leg. The second leg was a 2-1 with one of them being a penalty. If we get a 2-1 it's a comparatively good result.

We don't need to win this game all we need is a draw or even a loss as bad as 2-1 would be a good result.

Also we have a wall in our defence known as Navas and we know our captain marquinhos performs like a warrior in these matches. Neymar is also there to prove himself and we have mbappe.

I just want to know everyone's thoughts and hopefully get excited cause even though we are struggling and a lot of things are wrong. There are some good things too. I'm not saying we are the favourites and the situation is that great but we are still in it to win it. We can WIN the tie. Tomorrow is just half time.

JxMedo,1622348744.0,no3dhc,6.0,1.0,"I'm sure all of you guys saw how tuchel was reacting in the match, he never sat for a second, always telling players what to and most importantly rallying the fans in the stands to cheer higher. I have never seen tuchel this excited or energetic or even as engaged in all his time with us. Plus his tactics, truly masterclass, and all the players kept following the instructions till the last second.

This highlights problems in our dear psg. Why are our managers never this happy or excited, why aren't we seeing major changes when different coaches arrive (look at Chelsea this season or Bayern the season before). Why do the same problems exist year after year. I don't really know. But in my opinion this comes down to 3 things: first the higher ups in the club aren't giving the manager the freedom he wants evident by all the problems between the staff, second the club is very pampering of the players. They are shielded from the higher ups and are rarely seen giving their all on the field. Finally, its the attitude of our players, never following the intended structure or plan, the selfishness of others, this goes back to them having all that protection from the club.

Poch isn't a bad manager we all know that, we've seen glimpses of his amazing football, but at the end of the day all managers tend to end up in the same position, either give the ball to neymar, or throw it across to mbappe. Is it the player's fault? The management? Both?

Ik the British media hyped the shit out of Manchester city but I still feel they were more than achievable and we bottled it. They were supposed to be like Bayern but they weren't as destructive Bayern.

Against us in the first leg aka ""the best English performance an English team had""(our friend Gary linekar)  they had an xG of 0.44 in that half. Despite us being a Man down for the last 20mins or so. Ft xG being 1.53 to 0.89. Mbappe was the one creating chances so he was almost non existent (most big chances created 4)

For the second leg there wasn't much of a tactical change by pep. We didn't have mbappe and neymar and adm had to come deep as always. We kinda lost the psychological battle in the second leg as we had to chase and we played it onto their hands(which they won fair and square). Their first goal was a kimpembe error (Florenzi sleeping (correct me if I'm wrong)) and second a counter.


Basically 3 out of four goals were errors against man city.

Tonight they had an xG of (0.52). Before this they had an easy route of gladbach, Bvb and the group stage of Marseille, Porto and olympiacos.

They even struggled against Bvb and got their sigh of relief goal from a coaching error.

I just am underwhelmed and have this feeling we gifted again and bottled it.

Anyway I'm not complaining it's still have been a good season considering the situations, just wanted to let this out.

What i‚Äôm thinking right now is that we‚Äôre probably going to change managers again, something i dont really like but unfortunately we can‚Äôt decide who stays and who goes. Zidane might become our new manager since we‚Äôre going after the players that he wants. I know we‚Äôve been linked to Camavinga , Aouar, Tchouameni, Hernandez or Hakimi even before but now i‚Äôm thinking that the interest is real and these are the kind of players Zidane wanted at RM (except for Hakimi , that RM was forced to sell due to the enormous debt they got) . Its crazy to see that the only player Real Madrid‚Äôs really after right now is Mbappe, the rest have gone to dust.


Its just my theory , i wish its not true because a new manager means a new playstyle and we can‚Äôt afford to just keep on changing the guy who controls the dressing room because it wouldn‚Äôt be a good thing for our players (It would be the 3rd in less than 6-7 months) . But even if it is, i wish the team stays as connected as they‚Äôve been lately.

I understand that this mercato doesn't put us over the top especially at fullbacks, but Ait-Nouri at least gives us guarantees that Bakker can't. Diallo proved that he can be good enough as Bernat gets into form.


Ricardo Pereira solves the Florenzi problem at RB and I know Leonardo doesn't rate Dagba, but good fullbacks are hard to find so we might as well develop what we have. He has enough athletic ability to be decent offensively and defensively as we move forward. Same with Pemb√©l√© 

Signing Neves &amp; Aouar  while getting rid of Danilo and Rafinha is a clear upgrade at both positions. 

Getting Camavinga while keeping Paredes gives him competition to push both players to compete for the same spot. Both have something to prove. 

I'm keeping Herrera at the very least until January for his leadership.

We've seen what his creative ability gets us in the games against man u and bayern ( I still drool when I see that assist to marquinhos). And this may just be my lay brain talking but neymar's skills very rarely yield results for the rest of the team even if he gets past the players. For reference, look at the second leg against Bayern. Neymar was untouchable that match yet we lost. 


As an added bonus he would get injured less as less players will be looking to foul him.

Jotzumah,1621853333.0,njv3bj,1.0,1.0,"I've been following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's career since his Inter days, becoming a huge fanboy in the process, and now that his career (slowly) comes to a close have had some time to reflect on his various stations. 

Overall, I have the fondest memories of his time at PSG. Winning Ligue 1 in 4 out of 4 seasons, finishing with the domestic Quadruple in his final season 15/16, as well as on an individual statistic level, like leading the topscorer race with 38 goals and 13 assists in 31 games, amazing stuff. Sure, many will argue that they didn't have much competition in Ligue 1, but even then, the French league had some quality players who went on to do well in bigger leagues, too. 

Since Zlatan has left PSG, they ""only"" won 3 out of 5 possible League titles. While I haven't followed the club as closely after his departure, they still seemed to dominate most of their games and I also enjoyed many of their Champions League performances, apart from losing their heads against Man City. Seeing class players from Zlatan's time still at PSG, such as Marco Verratti, Angel di Maria and Marquinhos, reminded me of those glory days 5 years ago. Apart from an unlucky exit from the Champions League (against Man City, just like this year) it really felt like a perfect season (winning the league by a margin of 31 points lol), and I felt Zlatan played a huge role in forming the team from 2012 to 2016 and leading them to all this domestic success. 

Is this position shared among PSG's fans? Is Zlatan considered a club legend? Do they miss a vocal leader like him? Mbappe and Neymar are exceptional players talent-wise, but Mbappe is still very young and Neymar's character doesn't seem to be the right fit for a leader. Again, this is just my observation from a Zlatan fan and PSG sympathizer standpoint, and I'm curious to hear what more entrenched PSG fans think about it.",psg,How does PSG's fanbase view Zlatan's time at the club?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/njv3bj/how_does_psgs_fanbase_view_zlatans_time_at_the/,2021-05-24 18:48:53

Jvancan,1621720350.0,nit1ud,16.0,1.0,"Hi boys!

According to ""LeParisien"", a newspaper a little bit more reliable than the tweetos in need of likes throwing clickbait everyday, Kiki will extend his contract with Paris if he feels that PSG wants to improve the team and go get the UCL. 

Why do I think they're right? 

Cause nobody can pay him like PSG.

Paris will be able to spend money on the role players we need to improve the team. 

We have the most interesting project in Europe. 

We just did UCL final and UCL semi final within a year. 

Even if Poch didn't show much since he arrived I feel he has a good connection with Mbappe. 

Paris gave him the responsibilities he wanted and ask for last year. 

Madrid is falling apart cause they did very bad transfers and they will struggle few seasons to come back to the top. 

Zidane is probably on his way out and was one of the reason why Kiki wanted to play in Madrid. 

Madrid can't afford him.

MBappe is crazy about numbers and I believe he wants to leave Paris making sure he checked all the stats records he can get. 

Last thing, He's a kid from Bondy and has PSG in his blood and wants to bring the UCL in Paris.

Be positive guys, summer will be good for us!

According to rumors, Barca are looking to sell Griezmann. If Mbapp√© doesn‚Äôt extend, PSG would lose their ‚Äúmain attraction‚Äù towards the French market. Griezmann is getting old, but he‚Äôs still quite popular in France and he‚Äôs in his prime right now.

From an economic perspective, he‚Äôd be able to make PSG a similar amount of revenue as Mbapp√©.

From a footballing perspective, he‚Äôd provide a source of playmaking up front other than Neymar. He could help connect the midfield by dropping deep so Neymar doesn‚Äôt have to.

 If not Griezmann, then how about Pogba? Also a popular face in French football, and he‚Äôd provide a source of creativity in the midfield other than Veratti.

That would be one team to watch! Of course I get that Ronaldo isnt actually the most needed player for your squad, but i think it would bring good exposure and make easier to sign other players also.

Hum-beer-t,1620845026.0,naw3pw,15.0,1.0,"One of the most common things that directed our club was the project. Players bought into it and it always seemed like the administration is actually serious about making this club a powerhouse.

Over the last few years this notion has completely melted into oblivion. We have done nothing but chop and change and hope that by some miracle we'll get to where we want to go.

The most alarming fact is the number of flops we have signed over the years - Trapp, Kehrer, Meunier, Stambouli, Guedes, Lo Celso, Krychowiak, Icardi, Sarabia, Buffon, Rico, Jese etc

It's much more evident now that there was no concrete project except signing Neymar and Mbappe. We wanted to create the next galacticos and now we may go trophyless this season.

The policy has to change, we have to stop bringing in toxic presences like Icardi and God forbid Serge Aurier. There needs to be proper scouting, an interest in the players of tomorrow! There is no rationale in signing big talk, no output Ander Herrera and utility players like Florenzi. I'm not asking for De Ligt or De Jong but at least a proper interest in players like Hlozek, Tchouam√©ni, or Loic Bade.

We have quality footballers and luckily they are loyal, mostly. The project needs to begin again. The concern has to be the team and only the team. Because not even Lionel Messi can drag a team to champions league glory.",psg,Where has the PSG project disappeared?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/naw3pw/where_has_the_psg_project_disappeared/,2021-05-13 02:43:46

MbappeIsTheGoat,1620567638.0,n8egus,18.0,1.0,"I think PSG should:

Lucas Digne from Everton. He has been one of the world's most underrated left-backs in the past couple of years.

Leo Dubois from Lyon. He has been Lyon's main crosser this season. If Lyon understandably do not want to sell him, then we can focus on Barcelona's Emerson.

Sell Icardi and buy Kean. Icardi has only shown up in smaller games, like against Angers, but not in bigger games, like against City. On the other hand, Kean's Cavani-like work rates are exactly what we need for this club.

If Mbappe, unfortunately, gets sold for around 150 million, PSG would need to buy a left-winger. I would say Mikel Oyarzabal for only 50 million would be a perfect option. He's young, can score and can playmake.

I would say, with the remaining 100 million, to buy Fabian Ruiz for about 60 million to replace Paredes. I know Paredes has been pretty good, but he's just not up to the PSG standard. PSG have reportedly put in an offer already.

FST_BEAST,1620425707.0,n7ai91,30.0,1.0,"Before you instantly downvote this post, hear me out. 

Our team has been built around two superstars; Neymar and Mbappe. Reports are that Neymar is probably going to extend his contract while Mbappe denied an extension 4 times. I think It's time to let him go and let him conquer other teams. He doesn't seem motivated, we want players who believe in the project and want to help it. 

So how will Mbappe's leave benefit us? Well, I think the problem with PSG is that we rely on these two players heavily. Proven in this Champions League and the last, our other positions are hurting. To win the UCL, it needs to be a collective effort. We need strong players in each position. Look at Liverpool when they won in 2019. They didn't necessarily have ""superstars"" but won because they had no weakness in any position. PSG doesn't have proper fullbacks and has been lacking in the midfield. 

With the funds of Mbappe, we can really improve all these positions. We can get the likes of Vinicius and Casemiro. Dybala is rumoured to be swapped with Icardi and Salah has been rumoured lately. We can truly buy 3 class players with the Mbappe money and I personally think 3 players that are above average is better than one superstar. 

We need squad depth and no weaknesses. Yes, Mbappe helps us scores goals but we are hurting elsewhere.

BAHOTVELLA,1620392909.0,n6y3q7,12.0,1.0,"A long read but in the end will definitely feel confident in our coach

Additional reporting: Dan Sheldon and Roshane Thomas.
It all starts with an idea.

Marquinhos intercepts the pass, and plays back to Keylor Navas. Under pressure from Lionel Messi, Navas passes to Idrissa Gueye, who plays back to Marquinhos, who passes forward to Marco Verratti. He plays out to Layvin Kurzawa, who returns the ball to Verratti, who passes to Leandro Paredes, who finds Gueye, who passes to Moise Kean, who comes back to Marquinhos. He spreads the ball left to Kurzawa, who crosses to Verratti, who flicks it onto Kylian Mbappe, who makes it 1-1 in the Nou Camp. Thirteen passes, 38 seconds, from one end of the pitch to the other, with eight players involved.

The fundamental idea of Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs management is the positional game. Whether he is coaching the stars of Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur, or the more humble academy graduates of Southampton or Espanyol, the idea is the same: to dominate the game by controlling the space, pursuing numerical superiority through your positions on the pitch.

Mbappe‚Äôs equaliser at the Nou Camp, the first goal of his hat-trick, was the perfect example of how Pochettino wants his teams to build up through the goalkeeper, dominate and attack.

It was a special goal but not a unique one. Remember when Spurs beat Everton 4-0 at Wembley in January 2018, and the glorious fourth that day. Hugo Lloris to Jan Vertonghen to Victor Wanyama to Ben Davies to Christian Eriksen, out on the left-wing. Eriksen back to Davies to Mousa Dembele to Vertonghen to Davinson Sanchez to Serge Aurier, forward to Harry Kane. He holds the ball up, feeds Aurier on the right, who finds Son Heung-min, who clips it forward to Dele Alli, who backheels the ball to Christian Eriksen, who sweeps the ball in. Fourteen passes, 35 seconds, from end to the other, with all 11 players involved.

That was one of Pochettino‚Äôs favourite Tottenham goals, the perfect example of the positional game in action, Spurs moving around and through Everton.



Another Pochettino favourite came from November 2015, just over one year into his tenure. Spurs were 2-1 up on Aston Villa in added time. Kyle Walker won the ball, found Erik Lamela, who exchanged passes with Eric Dier, and went back to Toby Alderweireld, who returned the ball to Lloris. He played out to Ben Davies who drove forward, played a one-two with Josh Onomah, found Eriksen, who played in Lamela, who played a first-time pass to Kane, who nailed his finish. Eleven passes, 33 seconds, nine players.

In all three of these goals, and plenty of others scored in Pochettino‚Äôs 12-year managerial career, the same characteristics are there. The precise way they play out from the back, never hoofing the ball long. The way the centre-backs split and drop. The way the full-backs provide width. The way possession is used as a means to dominate, but never the end in itself. The way the attacking players adopt the correct positions to give their team-mates options approaching the final third.

The striking thing about these goals, and Pochettino‚Äôs teams at their best, is how well structured they are in possession. They are not quite as rigid as Pep Guardiola‚Äôs Manchester City, but that is the closest comparison from any other style of play in the game. And the advantage of being this organised in possession is that it allows Pochettino‚Äôs teams to do the one thing they are most famous for: press.

It takes a good organisation and structure in possession to be able to win the ball back quickly. Pochettino likes to tell his players to press hard for the first three seconds after they lose the ball before retreating. And to do that effectively, they need to be in the right positions. You defend the way you attack, as Pochettino says, rather than the other way round.

This vision of the game informs everything Pochettino does on the training pitch. All of the double sessions, Gacon endurance tests, walking on hot coals and so on are geared towards getting his team to play like this. No matter which team he is coaching, he drills the players to see the game like he does, to take up the positions he demands, and to dominate the game through their positions on the pitch.

Just ask Rickie Lambert, one of the stars of Pochettino‚Äôs Saints.

‚ÄúThe biggest difference between Poch and all the other managers I played under was the way he looked at football‚Äù, Lambert tells The Athletic. ‚ÄúHe sets you up in a specific position, and so much detail goes into it.

‚ÄúFor example, say a ball comes from a throw-in and the other team scores a goal. Poch won‚Äôt say anything about the goal, he‚Äôll go back to the throw-in and say someone wasn‚Äôt stood in the right position, or we let someone out too easily. He‚Äôd say that‚Äôs where we need to improve. It was brilliant the way he changed my way of thinking.‚Äù

Or Jos Hooiveld, who quickly learned about the game Pochettino wanted to play. ‚ÄúHe was really clear about his ideas,‚Äù he tells The Athletic. ‚ÄúHe came with respect, but it was his idea and his vision. He just had to make sure everyone believed in his vision by showing them it could work. We picked it up fairly early on because he was very detailed.‚Äù

Pochettino has such belief in the positional game that he always wants his teams to play this way, no matter who they are up against. That has been true throughout his career, whatever level of players he is coaching. Southampton learned that in their second match under Pochettino.

‚ÄúHe set up us in all these positions so we could press the other team,‚Äù Lambert remembers. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt care who it was, whether it was home or away, we were always going to press. We played Man United and I think we went 1-0 up but they came back and won 2-1. Alex Ferguson later said that we were the best team they played at Old Trafford all season.‚Äù

Between the theory and the realisation on the pitch lies mountains of work. And what underpins all of that work is the second aspect of Pochettino‚Äôs approach to management: his relationship with his squad. Because all that tactical theory would be irrelevant if Pochettino could not convince the players to believe in him.

Pochettino‚Äôs job, and one that he relishes, is to make his players feel part of something. Those bonds of loyalty are what make the football come to life on the pitch.

In some jobs, this is easier than others. At Espanyol, Pochettino took over a struggling team, and while he arrived with the credit that comes from being a legendary player there, he still had to convince his former team-mates that they were good enough to fight their way out of the relegation zone. At Southampton, Pochettino arrived with no experience of English football but he found a team on an upward trajectory. They had earned consecutive promotions, they were pushed by the ambitious Nicola Cortese and the players believed they could achieve anything.

But Pochettino still needed to win his new players over, even across the language barrier. Danny Fox remembers one day, a couple of weeks after Pochettino arrived, being called into his office by assistant Jesus Perez, who interpreted between the two men.

‚ÄúI remember Mauricio asking me to tell him everything about myself,‚Äù Fox tells The Athletic. ‚ÄúI reeled off a few things. He asked, ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt you say that you were a Premier League footballer?‚Äô. I replied that‚Äôs just not the way I am, I would never say that. He told me I am a Premier League footballer, and that I should say that. It was little things like that. I was in his office for close to two hours. This was a fella who can‚Äôt speak English, but talking through his assistant there was no awkwardness. It was just people who enjoyed talking about football.‚Äù

That meeting is very typical of Pochettino. Of course, all managers speak to their own players but Pochettino is a man who wants to share everything with his players, clearing space in his diary, often making sure he has no scheduled meetings after training, so that he can speak with whoever he wants, for as long as they need. Everything should naturally flow.

Lambert tells a similar story about getting called into Pochettino‚Äôs office to be told that he had been called up for Roy Hodgson‚Äôs England squad for the first time. ‚ÄúIt was a lovely moment for me, my family and Poch,‚Äù Lambert says. ‚ÄúI could tell how much it meant to him. He called me into his office and gave me a big hug.‚Äù


Pochettino enjoyed a good relationship with his Southampton players (Photo: Getty)
At Tottenham the initial task was harder because of the mess that Pochettino inherited after the 2013-14 season, when neither Andre Villas-Boas nor Tim Sherwood could organise or motivate a disaffected squad.

In an attempt to bring the players together, Pochettino instituted handshakes at Spurs every morning before training. After he had planned the day‚Äôs activities, Pochettino would sit on a sofa in the canteen, waiting for the players to arrive for breakfast. They would shake hands with him and with each other. (When Dele Alli did not shake hands with Pochettino before a canteen meeting early on in his time at the club, he was warned not to make the same mistake again.)

That encapsulates one of the challenges of management, finding the right balance between encouraging the players to act a certain way while not forcing them to. So while Pochettino has high expectations in terms of behaviour, he does not want to enforce them.

For that reason, Pochettino has never believed in fining his players for minor disciplinary issues. In his view, the players deserve their salaries, and even then the club cannot especially hurt players by fining them when they are already so rich. The challenge of motivating the squad is to get all the players to buy into the group ethic and the manager‚Äôs philosophy because they sincerely believe in it, not because they are scared of getting punished if they do not.

While Pochettino wants a close relationship with his players, there still must be some distance. Pochettino and his staff will never go into the players‚Äô dressing room at the training ground. They believe that space is the players‚Äô sanctuary and the coaching staff have no business there.

Every manager in football can keep the first eleven happy. The challenge is to make sure that the whole squad is engaged in the success of the team, even the ones who are not playing. Pochettino is not very keen on being asked by players why they are not in the team, and some who have confronted him in the past about a lack of opportunities have not got much of a reply. But in Pochettino‚Äôs mind, no player has an automatic right to get in the team. As he always says, when a player signs a contract at a club, he signs to train, and to be available to play. The contract itself does not convey a right to play.

At the start of Pochettino‚Äôs first season at Spurs, Harry Kane was behind Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor in the pecking order. If Danny Welbeck had joined Spurs rather than Arsenal, Kane would have been fourth choice and might even have gone back out on loan. After a poor display away at Partizan Belgrade he did not even make the bench for a league game against West Brom. Kane was dismayed and wanted answers from Pochettino. But that was the moment when he realised he had to improve to get into the team.

One of the successes of Pochettino‚Äôs time at Spurs was forging those same bonds of loyalty even with the players who were not always in his first eleven. The key for him and his staff was to keep the other players in good condition, able to help the team and most importantly believing that they would be useful.

Every Christmas, when the games are relentless and the players are tired, Pochettino would rotate more, bringing in players who were not first choices before. And his Spurs team was consistently the best in the country over that busy Christmas period. From their four league games over Christmas, they took 10 points in 2014-15 and 2015-16, a full 12 points in 2016-17, back to 10 in 2017-18 and then nine in 2018-19.

The same was true at Southampton, and explains why even players who lost their places and were even let go by Pochettino speak so warmly about him. ‚ÄúHe was so encouraging to everyone in the squad,‚Äù Fox remembers. ‚ÄúHe treated every single person the same regardless of who they were, whether that was the likes of Rickie, Adam (Lallana), Morgan (Schneiderlin), or players like myself who had only played a few games, or were on the bench a lot. We were all treated the same.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe toughest job is keeping everyone happy, especially when you‚Äôve got a lot of good players like we did at Southampton. Everyone seemed to be happy whether they were in the squad or not. Everyone liked and had the respect for Mauricio and his staff. He treated us all like human beings.‚Äù

Motivation alone is not enough. Not to win games as consistently as Pochettino‚Äôs teams have done. For that, you need the other crucial aspect of his coaching: trying to improve every single player. Whether in terms of technique, fitness, psychology, every aspect of the game is there to be worked on.

Underneath all the hugs and meetings and handshakes lies a vast network of numbers, measurements and science, all to make sure that every one of his players is progressing in the right way. While some aspects of Pochettino‚Äôs methods have stayed the same since Espanyol, others have evolved with the progress of sports science.

To have a training process that pushes players to the limit but not beyond, you need a functioning monitoring regime first. So players have saliva tests every morning before breakfast, with Pochettino‚Äôs staff keen to measure their muscle damage, fatigue and hormone response. This way they can measure the players‚Äô readiness to train and to see if any of their players are more likely to pick up an injury. Prevention of injuries is hugely important and nothing is left to chance.

This allows Pochettino and his staff to push the players as hard as they can, to get them ready to play that physically demanding, high-pressing football. Because if you are one of Pochettino‚Äôs players, you have to work exceptionally hard.

It all starts in pre-season.

Pochettino‚Äôs favourite way to get his players fit in pre-season is the Gacon test. This was invented by Georges Gacon, a French fitness coach who worked with middle-distance runners before moving into football. The test gets the players to run for 45 seconds then rest for 15 seconds, with the distance they cover increasing 6.25 metres each time from an initial 150 metres. Gacon invented the test to push players‚Äô maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max).

Gacon worked at PSG in the late 1990s, trying to improve the players‚Äô physical condition, where he introduced the test. When Pochettino signed for PSG in 2001, Gacon had left but his test was still a big part of how PSG trained, and it has been part of Pochettino‚Äôs approach ever since. ‚ÄúI am honored that he is a fan of my 45+15 test‚Äù, Gacon told The Athletic via email.

‚ÄúI remember going to Austria and Spain for pre-season, it was so tough,‚Äù Fox remembers. ‚ÄúHe had us doing Gacon runs, he would be telling us it was easy, we would run for a bit, then wait, then go again. But it seemed to keep going and going. He‚Äôd be saying it was easy, ‚ÄòKeep going!‚Äô. But, oh my god!‚Äù

But the hard work does not stop when the season starts. Rickie Lambert remembers how demanding the physical training was on Mondays, when the players used to do 12 horseshoe runs of the training pitch.

‚ÄúTraining was so intense after games on Mondays,‚Äù Lambert says. ‚ÄúI used to think, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck is this?‚Äô. For the fit lads it was just a jog for them, but for the big lumps like me it was a tough ask.‚Äù

So Lambert went to Pochettino to complain. ‚ÄúWhen myself and Jos (Hooivelt) went to see Poch he had a big smile on his face. Poch was nodding his head and saying ‚ÄòI understand, Rickie‚Äô. I was probably foolish to think he was listening to what I was saying. I‚Äôve gone back to the lads to give them the good news, and I‚Äôm buzzing with myself.‚Äù

Lambert was in for a shock. ‚ÄúWe played on Saturday, had training on Monday and instead of doing 12 horseshoe runs, we do 24. That was the point where it was like: you either go with him or you don‚Äôt. That was the moment where we decided to go with it. Not one of us said anything about it after. Poch really pushed us when he started to know us more. Initially I thought, ‚ÄòWow, this guy is crazy‚Äô. But we all improved, and that was the fittest I had ever been in my career.‚Äù

Playing for Pochettino means having to work harder than you have ever worked before, and you do it all not only under the watchful eyes of his loyal staff, but in front of the cameras too. Pochettino likes to record every session, even in the gym, just so he knows who has been working and who has not.

You also get fewer days off than you would for other managers. For Pochettino, the point is to respect the game, the principles of elite sport and the players themselves. That respect is conveyed by trying to make all the players better, even the ones that are not in the first team. During international breaks it might be easier to give the non-selected players time off, but if you play for Pochettino you will still be working hard. Some players might not enjoy it but when Lucas Moura hit a second-half hat-trick at Ajax at the end of a tiring 2018-19 season in which he had never played for Brazil but still pushed to his limits with Tottenham, you could see that it was worth it.

At the heart of the Pochettino approach is the double session. In the middle of a week when there is not a midweek game, the players will have to train twice. After their morning session and then a three-hour rest break, the players will be back in for a second session. This session will take place in the gym, but it is not a traditional weight-lifting session. It is about functional movement, and the patterns of movements that players need in a game.

The theory is that in playing football there are four actions: running, jumping, competing for the ball and kicking (or throwing) the ball. These power sessions focus on each of those four actions, with varying resistance and repetitions, trying to build up the players‚Äô power and endurance over time.

At Tottenham, Pochettino was able to work in a high-quality gym, thought to be the best power gym for footballers in the world. But at Southampton he had to work in a Portakabin, for what they called ‚ÄúSpanish Gym‚Äù.

‚ÄúWednesday was the gym day,‚Äù says Fox. ‚ÄúIt was 11-v-11, everyone had to be at it, it was all go. The way Mauricio is on the sidelines, he wants everyone to press and win the ball back as high as possible. Then we‚Äôd go home and come back for the gym. It was something I have never done before, and I‚Äôve never done since I left Southampton.‚Äù

There was a VertiMax machine, with elasticated bands attached to a plate, players running out and coming back. There was a Keiser power rack, which Pochettino‚Äôs staff would push back down just as the players were squatting it back up. ‚ÄúWe used to do weight training, running, and it was really difficult,‚Äù Lambert says. ‚ÄúThey loved Luke Shaw because he was 17 at the time and he broke all sorts of records. Poch created an environment where lads would be in competition with each other, trying to get fitter and stronger.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe first few times I remember thinking, ‚ÄòWhat the hell is going on here?‚Äô,‚Äù Fox says. ‚ÄúI remember lads going outside to be sick. But it was all part of Mauricio‚Äôs plan to get everyone as fit as possible.‚Äù

But there is more to Pochettino‚Äôs training than just double sessions and power. He also likes doing cognitive training with the players, covering walls with electric lights that players have to reach, to test their reaction times.

And not all of the double sessions are decided by Pochettino himself. At Tottenham, the group of attacking players (usually Kane, Son, Dele and Eriksen) would organise a second double session during clear weeks, as well as the power session everyone did. The strikers, led by Kane, would spend 45 minutes working with three academy goalkeepers (never the professionals), practising different attacking movements and patterns and finishes. They would go back through old clips of their recent attacking performances, rival strikers, rival goalkeepers, seeing which keepers come off their line and which stay on it, testing out which finish might work under different conditions. Anything to get an edge.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to lie, I didn‚Äôt like him at first because he pushed me to my limit,‚Äù Lambert says. ‚ÄúHe did actually break me at one point. It wasn‚Äôt nice at the time but once you accept it, and go along with him, that‚Äôs when you see the true benefits. Physically and mentally, he pushes your game to a whole new level.‚Äù

In the summer of 2013, Pochettino wanted to find a way to take his Southampton team to the next level. So he called his old friend Xesco Espar, the former coach of the FC Barcelona handball team. When Pochettino had started coaching at Espanyol he had read Espar‚Äôs book, Jugar con el corazon (‚ÄúPlay from your heart‚Äù), loved it, and struck up a friendship with Espar.

A few years later, Pochettino went to Espar for advice. He told his old friend that he had an incredible team at Southampton, but that they did not believe in themselves enough. They only wanted to stay in the Premier League, Pochettino wanted to expand their ambitions, to do something with their hearts and minds.

So in pre-season, Pochettino took his players to Espar‚Äôs base in Spain to try out his motivational techniques. ‚ÄúAt first with footballers, especially from British culture, it‚Äôs a bit like you‚Äôre not going to do that,‚Äù Fox remembers. ‚ÄúBut everyone was on board. And then he sent us outside.‚Äù

Espar had the Saints players and staff walk over hot coals, a technique he had learned from American motivational speaker Tony Robbins. The players were told to take their shoes off and focus on something that motivates them as they walked across. Danny Fox remembers walking across and shouting ‚ÄúNo more Gacon runs!‚Äù as he completed his.

Six years later, Pochettino called Espar again. Tottenham had just qualified for the Champions League final, against Liverpool in Madrid. They had done the impossible in getting that far but now Pochettino wanted to focus on their mentality ahead of the final. He wanted to make sure the players would recognise their fears, tackle them and overcome them in the build-up to the final.

He set aside 45 minutes every morning in the build-up to the final to work on his players‚Äô mentality, as well as bringing Espar over, 10 days before the final, to run some more sessions, to develop the players‚Äô emotional state.

As well as walking on coals, Espar also had the players snap an arrow with their necks, to show the courage and strength required for a task like that. And Espar taught the Spurs players something he has discussed with Pochettino many times, about the four pillars that create your emotional state.

The first pillar is your posture, which creates your emotion. The second pillar is movement. The third pillar is where you focus. And the fourth pillar is your inner dialogue. With these four pillars the players could manage their emotional state.

They did exercises to show the importance of each pillar. They shook hands with one another, first with the idea that they were wasting their time, then with the idea that they were a salesman on commission, desperate to impress a customer. They were asked to recreate their celebrations on reaching the Champions League final, embodying that emotion, as difficult as that is.

Equipped with this knowledge, the players could walk over the hot coals knowing that, no matter what happened or whatever setbacks they may face, they could not change their emotional state. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that you have no pain,‚Äù Espar explains to The Athletic. ‚ÄúIt is that the universal energy protects you when your emotional certainty is at its top level.‚Äù

If there is a final ingredient to the Pochettino management, beyond the intricate style of play, the intense training and gym work, it is this spiritual side. Pochettino is a great believer in ‚Äúenergia universal‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is a superior energy that you can connect with, if you are open, if you have opened your mind,‚Äù he explained to a few journalists in a room at Spurs‚Äô training centre just before the 2019 Champions League final. ‚ÄúWith some strategies, you can connect with this energy, this energy that is so powerful, that makes you feel invincible.‚Äù

All Pochettino‚Äôs life he has felt a connection with this energy, and all of his career he has felt able to read and channel and embody it. (That is why his office at Spurs contained a bowl of lemons, because they absorb negative energy.)

For Espar, this almost spiritual ability is Pochettino‚Äôs greatest strength. ‚ÄúOne of the main traits of great leaders is you have to inspire people to be better than what they are,‚Äù Espar says of Pochettino. ‚ÄúBecause you see the greatness in the players before they even see it. He is able to talk with the players, convey that universal energy, and make them even bigger than what they are now. This is his gift. He believes in other people, and other people, when they talk with him, believe in themselves.‚Äù",psg,Pochettino's Philosophy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/n6y3q7/pochettinos_philosophy/,2021-05-07 21:08:29

That likely starts with Emery before filtering through to every position and every player.

Marco Verratti being sent off for dissent in the biggest game of his club's season felt a particularly apt image of why PSG have been unable to take that next step; the Italy international, in particular, hasn't really progressed over the last two years.

We thought the former Pescara man would be dominating and dictating midfields with ease by age 25, but he's no closer to those Andrea Pirlo levels than he was in 2015, and he still lets his petulant streak take over.

Mithan76,1620320643.0,n6c336,22.0,1.0,"So I've been wondering if anyone else feels similarly, but I'm getting tired of watching Neymar.

There is no doubt that he's a player that can be a genius at time, but i feel like, more often then not, I take little pleasure watching him. 

There is still that bit of excitement when he gets the ball, but after the 2nd or 3rd time in a game watching him run at 3 opposing players and flop to the ground, I have to resist the urge to turn off my TV.

I'd rather watch a team that is united, well-coordinated, rather than a team hoping for moments of individual brilliance.

I would also much rather watch a team with a better sporting spirit, not diving left and right, not running to the referee at every opportunity, and not losing its temper when things don't go their way.

I feel like this can never be psg as long as neymar is here, due to his playstyle and the ""superstar"" effect on the dressing room, and i find the idea of him extending with psg for another 4 years somewhat depressing.

I know this won't happen because Neymar marketing wise brings a lot to psg, but I personally would rather we let him go and use the fund to recruit a couple well spirited decent footballers, even if it means we don't go as far in UCL for a few years.

Now we will have to listen to endless ""Tuchel was sacked and reached the final"", but that's part of the sport. But saying that we would've ben in the final with him is most likely wrong. Here are my reasons why:

1. Chelsea have a more balanced team than we do. Their midfield is ""better than ours"" considering they have Kante, who is  around the same level as Verratti (just not in the same things). Their attack is their weak point, but we know that Tuchel is a coach that does great things in defense and he was able to do that, playing 5ATB, which most players knew from when Conte won the PL with them. Especially their fullbacks are 2 levels higher than ours
2. Tuchel was in his last year with us and already knew before the Final 8, that he would not be renewed. My speculation is that Tuchel would've ben sacked this last summer if we wouldn't have reached the final. It was kind of a postponement, to what everyone knew.
3. Tuchel had his problems with our board, that is no secret. He was already fired back at Dortmund for the same shenanigans and what a lot of you don't seem to remember was that we already chose our coach over the SD once, when Antero Henrique and Tuchel almost went throat to throat. 
4. In my opinion we were stagnating at the end. Tuchel is a coach who can make things work really well with the options he has, but I think long term commitment and improvement is not his thing (kind of the anti-Guardiola). I'm not sure if it was because he didn't have the team behind him anymore or something else. But Mbappe didn't improve under Tuchel and the ""Neymar-ball"" accusations had some merit to them. Maybe Tuchel knew himself that he wasn't gonna last and that certainly changes his motivation (even unconciously). 

I'm not defending the board or anything, they have their flaws and we should know that, but if we sack two SD's before our coach, our long-term planning is seriously flawed too. Is Leonardo the right SD? I'm not sure, but let's wait and see what he can do now with a coach that he actually appointed.

After all, it wasn't a nuclear fallout like the typical Mourinho sacking or  ""PSG bottling it"" leading to the sacking of Tuchel. It was a somewhat quiet change (maybe a tad too late imo), leading to me hoping that Chelsea can win the UCL. We maybe could've waited for the end of the season, but it most likely wouldn't have ended as good as it did now. Remember that we didn't lose in the RO16 of the Europa League against the Sokovian champion. Nor did we lose after winning the first game 4:0. We lost against the Premier League champion (at least this weekend) that has spent more on their defence than we did for Neymar and Mbappe **combined** with Guardiola as their coach.",psg,Congrats to Tuchel and Thiago Silva.

That's the main issue with Neymar the moment he joined PSG it's always injury he plays max max 20 to 25 games in a season

Neymar was for me when we bought him after messi the best player in the world. I expected neymar to score 35+ goals in a season like messi and ronaldo do. 

Considering he's one of the best players in the world, in the soon to be 4 years he's spent at PSG he's only played 66 league games... 66!? 28 in the UCL, but it's pretty crazy right? This means he's not featured in 82 Ligue 1 games since joining.

Its seems like that mbappe is currently more important to the team than neymar is. Neymar is sook gonna be 30 years old and like we all known with brazilians.

Why I can understand the feeling towards Tuchel to some extend, I was puzzled hearing similar thing about Silva.

The reasons I got for that were the following:  
\- Silva is a let down in big games and never delivered the Champions League  
\- Silva is mainly responsible for the 6-1 loss to Barcelona  
\- Silva only stayed at PSG for money, and had no bound with the fans or the club  


Is that a well-spread feeling inside the PSG community ?

I have quit finding them as there are none and now we have to get straight to recruiting some new players because something isn't right.


Now I love M'Bappe and Neymar, two very skilled players but we cannot continue resting our hopes in them or we will end up like this for the 100th time.

For Kylian we could get a huge payout from interested clubs (I reckon 160mil+) and Neymar is keen on staying from what I gather.

With the money from Kylian's transfer and with selling/releasing certain players who takeup wage money we could buy some great players.

In my opinion we would need a LB, RB, CDM and of course a replacement for Kylian if he is sold.

We could make use of the bad financial situations within many of the top clubs and take certain players from them.

I reckon for CDM we could just use Marquinhos and then find a good CB like Varane or someone similair who is willing to leave their club.

We could also get Sancho on the wing as Kylian's replacement!

LB/RB spots could be found aswell in the likes of Mendy, AWB/TAA etc. These players could be apart of a swap deal to Liverpool/Real for Kylian. For example, TAA+Salah for Kylian and we pay some extra money.

Also for CDM I would love Kante or Camavinga at CM. Camavinga isn't renewing his contract at Rennes and Kante might like a new challenge if they were to drop out from Real today.

I'm just throwing ideas at the wall so if you have any feel free to drop them because I would like to see how everyone is thinking!",psg,Summer transfer window,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/n5gn36/summer_transfer_window/,2021-05-05 22:02:31

Fee-Visual,1620190935.0,n57uhn,34.0,1.0,"I'm definitely not the biggest fan of Mauro, but I hate seeing people thrashing him. When we bought him, we knew that he isn't the player that will take the ball, dribble past the whole team and score a scorpion. We knew that he is only good in the box. Last night, I don't think he got a single touch in the box, because our whole midfield (maybe except for Veratti) decided to play hero ball. It's like buying a car for 50 million, not giving it fuel and then acting shocked why doesn't it move, we payed so much for it. I'm definitely not a fan Mauro and I hate things he does off the pitch, but you can't put any blame on him when he didn't get anything to work with.",psg,Icardi,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/n57uhn/icardi/,2021-05-05 13:02:15

JxMedo,1620163241.0,n4ymnd,44.0,1.0,"First: are you on neymar's payroll or something? Approved user and still can't make a proper discussion wow. 

I don't care about the result, we deserved the loss, a mixture between bad coach plan, players being off, us not playing as a team again. And everything being chaotic on field, its as if the team conjured their spirit from 2 season back. But the major problem for me is neymar, I'm gonna say it and i dont care anymore. Neymar isn't a player to control the pace of the game or the pace of passes. He's very inconsistent, stubborn, and mostly selfish with his decisions. Yes he's a dribbling genius and makes good passes on a good day, but that's like 2 match out of 10 and it's too inconsistent. Instead of making the transition and ball carrying easier he mostly always finds a way to make it slower and harder, instead of untangling a knot he makes it 10 times harder due to his movement and decisions. He keeps the ball far too long, keeps on hitting wall after wall, gets agitated quickly, starts to make wrong passes. 

This isn't from a couple of matches, i watch 98% of psg games i've been a fan long before neymar came, and this is a patern in his game style. I wasn't one of the people who said that neymar isn't important but i'm starting to see it now, this guy isn't offering solutions most of the time, yes he creates chances in front of the goal on a good day but it's not enough to play a couple of good games and be litteral shit in most of the others. 

This isn't how you win the champions league, and i'm done with his play style, with him being the center of movement, with him dictating the pace. Get this team a real fucking playmaker who knows what's he doing and get neymar back to being a glorified right wing, he isn't a playmaker, he shouldn't be tasked with starting plays or carrying a ball. I'm sick of seeing this year after year.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying neymar needs to get out, im saying that he's not a playmaker and shouldn't be treated as one. We need a true playmaker, someone who is level headed, makes the right decisions, and controls the pace well.",psg,"Repost since Mods hid my initial post, really mature guys ‚ù§Ô∏è guess there isn't a place for free speech on our team's subreddit",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/n4ymnd/repost_since_mods_hid_my_initial_post_really/,2021-05-05 05:20:41

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

7': PENALTY FOR PSG!! Zinchenko penalized for handball! That hit his shoulder, though, there's no way that's going to stand. ...VAR cancels! NO PENALTY!

11': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL MAN CITY!! Kevin De Bruyne sets himself and fires, Navas pushes it away but *Riyad Mahrez* is the one who picks it up on the wing and smashes it into the far side!**](https://streamja.com/wazJo)

16': Neymar's free kick deflects over the crossbar for a corner.

16': Marquinhos hits the crossbar! He got way up in the air for a header right in front of goal, but not high enough to keep the header down.

19': Ederson with a terrible throw! Di Mar√≠a picks it up and fires quickly at the open net but curls it just wide from 25 yards!

22': [](#icon-yellow) *Ander Herrera* carded, I believe for dissent over a call that didn't go his way. Things getting scrappy out there

30': De Bruyne takes an ambitious shot from 25 yards at the top far corner and whistles it about a yard or so off-target.

36': Ander Herrera tries a difficult turning shot from a difficult angle, it's well hit but about a yard over the bar.

41': I guess that's a shot from Foden but it goes up in the air and not really anywhere near goal, Navas catches it easily.

45+2': Bernardo's shot takes a scary deflection but fortunately for PSG misses the top corner.

**HT Manchester City 1-0 Paris St. Germain [3-1 on agg.]** PSG have had their chances but it's Man City who've increased their lead. PSG need two second half goals to take it to extra time.

-----

46': We're back!

54': Big save! Foden is sprung by a big pass, he's one-on-one with the keeper but Navas blocks the shot! Oh, and the flag goes up late anyway.

54': A giveaway by Marquinhos! Foden gets another chance at it but Navas stops it again!

KFlow99,1619886125.0,n2lnoy,23.0,1.0,"Here we are again, so close to winning the Champions League but we got a mission impossible in Manchester next week. Judging the fact that we might get eliminated i‚Äôd like to discuss with you guys the possible moves that we should make in the summer for next season! Its simply a discussion between fans because we all know that we can‚Äôt decide who leaves and who joins. So i‚Äôd like to start with the players i‚Äôd like to leave ASAP :

1) The first one HAS to be Kehrer : Ever since he joined us, he has never proven to be good enough. He‚Äôs had moments when he‚Äôs made us have a little faith in him, but thats it , he never justified the price we got him for.

2) As we all know , Kurzawa : Average at best, and terrible at worst. We got plenty of left backs , and next season we‚Äôre gonna have Bernat too alongside Diallo&amp;Bakker.Bernat‚Äôs one of the best in the world when not injured

3)Sarabia : Lets be honest, he‚Äôs not that bad , especially for the price we got him (20 millions) but he aint the best either and i don‚Äôt see him starting if our forwards aint injured. If we manage to get 20-25 mil from this guy it would be damn perfect

4)Herrera : a free agent, and we literally spent nothing on him except the salary but i guess its time to let him go.He hasnt offered as much as expected from him and we‚Äôre full of average midfielders, especially knowing that Danilo will be our player this summer.

5) Paredes (optional)  : I know a lot of you guys won‚Äôt like this but even though he‚Äôs been okay-good for us i think we should sacrifice him for a better midfielder. If we manage to get a world class midfielder, Paredes would probably stay on bench and I don‚Äôt like this. Paredes may not be the best in the world(actually he‚Äôs average/good)  but he gives everything for the jersey and i really appreciate this so I‚Äôd prefer to sell him so he could be starter somewhere else (Juventus&amp;Inter want him, so i guess 40m would be fair) 

Now it comes to signings : We actually need 3-4 good signings and probably all of them would be starters, we all know we got some holes in our starting 11 


1) Sergio Ramos/ another CB or CDM: The only nice thing Tuchel did (except CHL final) was that he had faith in Marquinhos and tried him at the center mid spot (a kind of defensive mid) and i cant lie : Marquinhos is one of the best in the world in that position and his link up play w Verrati was amazing so if Poch decides to make him a proper cdm, we should go for a center back , someone like Ramos : that can give Kimpembe some experience and help him grow more (we all know kimpembe got plenty of potential left). If Poch decides to keep Marquinhos at his real Position, then a CDM is what we need : I‚Äôd love Fabinho, Kante or Camavinga! Fabinho would be the perfect choice, since he can play at center back too. 

2) a center mid to cover/play w Verratti or a back up forward : This all depends on how Poch will play next season : If its a 4/3/3 then we all know we need a center mid , someone like Aouar that can cover Verratti when he‚Äôs injured , and can play alongside him when he‚Äôs fit. If Poch plays a 4/2/3/1 then we need a back up forward, i‚Äôd totally go with Neres (Ajax) , he can pretty much cover everyone except Icardi, but we‚Äôre probably going to have Kalimuendo for that spot. 

3) Right back : Dagba has been decent in the last games, but we need someone there still. We shall not buy Florenzi and we should go all out for Emerson (Real Betis-Barca). 

4) This will probably be the last signing we need but its all optional in case our dear MR. Kylian Mbappe doesn‚Äôt sign a new contract or we got plenty of money to spend but dont know where(after we‚Äôve boosted up our whole squad that i doubt) : LIONEL MESSI . I have nothing to say about him, we all know his capabilities and we all know he‚Äôd be the signing of the Decade but it should happen only in case Mbappe wants to leave or that we have bought all the players we need and got still room for another one. No offense to Messi, as i love him but I wouldn‚Äôt like to play him the way Juve‚Äôs playing Ronaldo. We need world class players first and then sign Messi

Fourth, Neymar is shit, my team won a Libertadores against his club, goals of Emerson Sheik, Neymar is only good against inexpressive clubs, that's why we hate him in Brazil and playing for the national team, he is selfish and don't play for the team.

Mbappe was nearby and I believe ney wanted Bakker to pass back to him and from there he would pass to Kylian. Anyway Bakker missed Neymars pass and the ball goes out and it becomes a City throw in. Neymar got REALLY frustrated and basically yelled at Bakker and his arms were up in the air. And French media (and a BUNCH of French fans on Twitter) is now saying Neymar shouldn‚Äôt have treated Bakker like that and how it isn‚Äôt what a leader does and that it isn‚Äôt good for Baker‚Äôs confidence. 

I‚Äôm a firm believer in what happens in the game stays in the game.

90375,1624602306.0,o7i0hh,12.0,1.0,"I think if Mbappe stays at PSG it will denote a paradigm shift in football world. Yes ligue 1 is shit and it is farmers league, but if Mbappe, Neymar, Locatelli, Verrati, Marquinhos,Hakimi play at 1 team, then that team is of course better than real madrid.

Real madrid, just because it has history, doesn't mean every big player should want to play for it.

History can be created. History is to be created. There is no meaning of being proud of history.

With the money that PSG can pump, I really think it is a paradigm shift in football world.

And also ""No player is bigger than club"" is also bullshit. A club is as good as its players. Yes you can argue that we have history, but history doesn't mean shit. History can be created, legacy can be created. PSG has reached 2 semifinals in a row with a team that will be half good as the team that they will have next season.

I also believe mbappe might leave PSG, but if he stays, it will surely denote a paradigm shift in the footballing world.

I reckon that Navas is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, so I struggle to understand how you can keep him and Donnarumma in the team at the first time.  


Both of them are the type of keeper who needs to play all the time to have confidence, so neither would be a good back-up.  


Still, signing Donnarumma for free is, of course, genius. However, while Navas is still at his top (let's say next 2 years), should Donnarumma be loaned away? Surely many teams would be happy to get him on loan for 2-3 years, Milan included.

**Trivia**    

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Reims have lost 62% of their Ligue 1 matches against Paris in the 21st century (8/13), with only 3 wins and 2 draws. Reims have lost two straight games to Paris in the top flight, but have never lost three in a row to the capital club in L1.  
  
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Paris have scored exactly 4 goals in 3 of their last 6 Ligue 1 matches against Reims.  
    
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Reims have not won any of their last 11 Ligue 1 matches (7 draws, 4 defeats), the worst run of any team currently in the top flight and their longest run since October 2012-February 2013 (15).  
  
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Paris have won their first 3 Ligue 1 games this season and could win their first 4 games of a Ligue 1 campaign for the 6th time in their history and the 1st since 2018/19.  
  
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Paris remain on a five-game winning streak in Ligue 1, their best since September-November 2020 (8).

I guess Mbappe probably would‚Äôve told Real that he didn‚Äôt wanna walk out free since that would make him a villain in his hometown, so make an offer this summer or else he‚Äôs gonna sign an extension which makes Real has to pay in excess of $200mil in future. But Real may have thought that they could show Mbappe that they wanna get him by putting an offer out for $180mil but on the last week of the window which PSG most probably not gonna accept since it‚Äôs impossible to find a replacement in 7 days. By doing so, they could make Mbappe not sign any extension with PSG since they didn‚Äôt let him leave when the offer came, and can get him for free next summer. And Mbappe has an excuse to walk out for free as well. 

This is the only way to make sense of this drama and I think Perez is playing a smart game.

Zheguez,1630086553.0,pcsc13,54.0,1.0,"This whole drama, regardless if he leaves now or next summer, has shown that even PSG still struggle to keep or convince the players that we would like to stay/come to the old guard clubs like Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona. Clubs that millions of kids and likewise talented young players around the world grow up dreaming to play for. 

And, those two are not alone. German kids want to play for Bayern, English/Anglophone kids want to play for top English clubs yet we have difficulties with maintaining the   talent within our club's academy or captivating kids from Paris lui-m√™me,  France, let alone Francophone kids or otherwise elsewhere in the world to come/stay in Ligue 1.

Do you think winning Champions League is all that it would take? I wasn't sure at first but now I'm even less convinced that's all it would take considering Mbappe's completely leaving the best chance PSG has to win it for the risk of attempting to establish himself at Madrid. Marseille won CL (with dubious and corrupt circumstances around it even if it didn't involve the final itself) almost 30 years ago and for all the (undeserved imo) reverence they continue to get, no young talent is/has been clamoring to bring OM back to its former glory unlike say Milan.

Fact is, unfortunately, most of our European rivals have won multiple Champions Leagues, historical domestic dominance, or just play in more ""fashionable"" leagues (heck kids the world over dream of playing for Arsenal or City over us so you know it's not just about CL),  that PSG and Ligue 1 can't compete just based on reality and circumstances. 

I'm saying all of this as someone that resonated with a player like Mbappe for multiple reasons and it feel like the cap of so many young talent leaving the club and the league over the years. We still have the likes of Kimpembe, Kalimeundo, Michut, hopefully Camavinga soon but it'd mean a lot if/when the next generational talents from around the world will look at and regard this club the way they do at the other European elite.",psg,What will it take for players like Mbappe to want to play for and stay at Paris Saint-Germain?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/pcsc13/what_will_it_take_for_players_like_mbappe_to_want/,2021-08-28 01:49:13

**When is the draw?**


The 2021/22 UEFA Champions League group stage draw ceremony begins at 18:00 CET on Thursday 26 August. It is being held in Istanbul, Turkey and¬†will be streamed live on UEFA.com. Special guests Branislav Ivanoviƒá and Michael Essien will assist with the draw.




**Who is involved in the draw?**


Twenty-six teams qualified automatically for the group stage, with the final six berths decided¬†via the play-offs.

ENG: Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea
ESP: Atl√©tico, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Villarreal
ITA: Inter Milan, AC Milan, Atalanta, Juventus
GER: Bayern, Leipzig, Dortmund, Wolfsburg
FRA: LOSC, Paris
POR: Sporting CP, Porto, Benfica
NED: Ajax
RUS: Zenit
AUT: Salzburg
BEL: Club Brugge
UKR: Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk
TUR: Be≈üikta≈ü
SUI: Young Boys
SWE: Malm√∂
MDA: Sheriff



**How the draw works**


The teams will be split into four seeding pots. Pot 1 will consist of the holders, the UEFA Europa League winners and the champions of the six highest-ranked nations who did not qualify via one of the 2020/21 titles; Pots 2 to 4 are determined by the¬†club coefficient rankings.


No team can play a side from their own association.


In the case of associations with two representatives, clubs have been paired in order to split their matches between Tuesdays and Wednesdays. In the case of associations with four representatives, two pairings have been made. These pairings are to be based on TV audiences.


The top two teams in each group advance to the round of 16.


The third-placed sides in each group transfer to the UEFA Europa League knockout stage, where they will face the UEFA Europa League group runners-up for places in the last 16.

Which clubs are paired?

To ensure that paired clubs from the same country play on separate days where possible, the eight groups will be distinguished by colour: Groups A to D will be red and Groups E to H will be blue. When a paired club is drawn, for example, in one of the red groups (A, B, C or D), the other paired club ‚Äì once it has been drawn ‚Äì will automatically be assigned to one of the four blue groups (E, F, G or H). The pairings are as follows:

A Chelsea &amp; Manchester City

B Atl√©tico de Madrid &amp; Sevilla

C Inter &amp; Juventus

D Bayern &amp; Dortmund

E LOSC Lille &amp; Paris Saint-Germain

F Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona

I am planning a visit to Paris with my mom for the first time in her life as a gift for her finally being able to retire :)

We are both big football fans and Costa Ricans. So, it is only normal for us to want to attend a PSG match (hoping Keylor plays hehe) and I thought it would be amazing to go to where the team trains with a CR flag and just spend some hours there hoping Navas will pop up.

If I remember correctly, he has been super kind to fellow Costa Ricans when they meet him, even from his time at RM.

So, I would like to see how realistic it would be to get to say hi to some players, even if they are in their cars at the entrance of the training center.

There are rumors that we might go for Richarlison if Mbappe is sold to Real this summer. Tbh I don't know much about him, never seen him play, only heard stuff here and there (especially lately thanks to Olympics).  
Without talking about the Mbappe transfer (since for now, nothing is done yet), what are your thoughts on Richarlison as a player, for those who followed him?   
Is he good? How big is his potential? Is he fit for our system? Can he somehow replace Mbappe? Is he the type to penetrate and do frontal attacks? Speedy player? Technical?  
I'm quite surprised tbh, I thought we would go for another bankable big star to replace Mbappe, so hearing his name in the news was surprising, unless he's got potential and possibly go for a world class LB + another mid player with the transfer money from Mbappe.

Di Maria with his dribbling and trademark chip was so nice to see.

Gueye FINALLY scores one of his many attempted longshots and overall brought some solidity and tenacity (along with Verratti) to the midfield that I think we have been missing.

I don't know what I was expecting from Herrera, but not the start to the season that he is having. I completely gave up on him tbh at the end of last season but he has been very decent, even good at times! Kudos to him lol

Honorable mention to Icardi. He had a bit more desire it seemed and although I do expect more, I'm not mad at what he showed.

I like Juanito a lot, and even though he wasn‚Äôt the best in the world, he was still doing a good job on the left side before his injury.  The problem is, well he is still yet to come back from said injury, and it happened almost **one full year ago**.  

He was supposed to be back around march, but due to complications post surgery (infection and whatnot), he‚Äôs still nowhere to be seen on the pitch.  And I know that a torn ACL is one of the worst injuries a professional athlete can go through, but we often say that after coming back, one needs as much time as they were out to be back at their level.  So I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I‚Äôm having a hard time being confident in a player who hasn‚Äôt seen a football pitch in a year‚Ä¶

The really frustrating thing with Juanito is that he was our starting left back, and our best in several years.  Assuming that he never plays at his prime level again, who are we stuck with ? Kurzawa is terrible enough, but even him will probably leave soon.  I guess we could use Diallo, but it‚Äôs not his ideal position and even him is a little injury-prone (+ I am tired of the *bricolage*).  I heard talks about Nuno Mendes, I am not going to lie, I don‚Äôt know much about him.  Is he just a panic buy to have someone to rotate Bernat with ? Or is he enough to be our starter all season ?

Zheguez,1628963711.0,p4craq,7.0,1.0,"As the season opener approaches, with all the news, there's an immense amount of hype surrounding the club and with that added pressure. Pretty much everywhere you go online someone will comment ""if PSG don't win X then they are a failure"" be it Champions League, Ligue 1, a treble, even having an invincible season (?!) etc. It's gotten to the point that even journalists are starting  getting into that narrative. 

Unfortunately, I didn't grow up watching the era of Madrid's original Galacticos so I don't know if there was a  an added pressure for them but it does seem like it stems from a place of wanting to see Paris St. Germain fail by any means necessary therefore make the goalposts of success higher to the point of being somewhat unreasonable. I'm not saying that it's unreasonable for fans (mainly) against or for PSG to have high expectations but it comes across shallow and somewhat unrealistic. After all, the main objective for PSG, is achieved a knockout tournament where anything good or bad technically could happen. Yet, if clubs such as Bayern, Juventus, Chelsea and more (even Man City to a degree) build an outstanding squad they are not placed with these kinds of standards. 

√áa c'est mes pens√©es et observations. J'aimerai savoir que vous pensez. 

Bonus: I'd like to get to know the other members of this sub a little more. Do you follow any other clubs or sports? How did you come to start following PSG? 

For me, I'm a Nashville SC supporter since the 4th division (NPSL) days that also follows Newcastle United (feels like it sort of balances out). I'm also into hockey (big Preds fan) and basketball.

I've been following PSG for the past couple of years mainly because I enjoy seeing a club from a Francophone community do well especially as there's little representation for that in the top of this sport plus my own connection growing up french speaking in the US where obviously not many people speak French. That, and, despite club's connections to Qatar, it felt like PSG fans don't get a fair shake or much respect within the football/soccer community, so the ""us vs the world"" mentality even if not an underdog was captivating to me after a long while (like the Detroit Pistons ""bad boys"" era for any NBA fans here).",psg,Anyone else a bit nervous about the upcoming season?

Then he just starts pressuring Mbappe publicly. Like what was the point of saying he has no excuse to leave? Maybe he wants to be the center of his own project and face of La Liga similar to Neymar in 2017. Mbappe has already achieved everything in France and done so much for PSG. he's at times been a better player than Neymar, won three ligue 1s, the domestic cup, and made several Champions League runs. You all are angry saying he's being egotistical, but how? He hasn't disrespected the club by saying anything regarding the transfer, he's always been about the team and has been humble. He's simply entering the next chapter of his career. Do you guys just expect him to stay at PSG his whole life when he has the potential to be a superstar and win the Balon D'Or. By staying at PSG he pretty much guarantees that he won't be the center of attention (which he deserves) for 2-3 more years.

best_jerky,1628876095.0,p3q0qj,12.0,1.0,"Hi fellow Psg fans, my class has been fortunate enough to visit your lovely city of Paris late September. Initially I was planning on watching a game at Parc des Princes with some friends but it kind of took of and all teachers and students wants to participate. 

I've now got the responsibility for getting these tickets and I need to get 32... 
Being a student we obviously want the best deal possible and therefore we would like to avoid buying the tickets second hand. 

I'm well aware that the demand for tickets have skyrocketed since the signing of Leo Messi(congrats by the way) and it being the big derby with Olympique Lyonnais certainly isn't helping my course.

As far as I am aware I would need to sign up for 16 MyParis memberships in order to have a chance to snatch the tickets. 

So I would like to tap into your fantastic fan group in order to try and work out a plan to make the impossible possible.

My questions are following:
Is it even possible to get 32 tickets?

How do I get this many tickets?

How much would I have to pay?

When will the tickets be released?

Thanks in advance to everyone who has helped me this far!

mxb555,1628806412.0,p3a7eg,26.0,1.0,"Although I'm of course excited about all of the new arrivals this mercato, I think Pochettino has a lot of tough decisions ahead, and I was wondering what you guys thought about these lineup situations:

1. Navas or Donnaruma: Although Navas has been incredible, especially in big games, Donnaruma is in great form at the moment having won the Euro 2020 player of the tournament. It would have been a mistake not to get the best young keeper in the world on a free transfer, but I would rate them about the same so it's a tough one. I've heard that Donnaruma might play Ligue 1 matches and Navas UCL matches, so that could be a good solution.
2. 3 or 4 Attackers: While Messi/Neymar/Mbapp√© is obviously an incredible combination, playing them as a front three would sideline √Ångel di Mar√≠a. Di Mar√≠a is most comfortable on the right wing, but he could play CAM as well. It just seems like a waste of talent to not play him and add another midfielder (like Parades or Gueye).
3. Messi vs Mbapp√©: Messi, who moved himself to the right wing to accomodate Suarez at Barca, has played very centrally ever since, while Mbapp√©, who played RW for France and Monaco, has also played a central striker position recently, despite stating he prefers to play on the left, where Neymar has been (although he can also play CAM). It just seems very interesting to me who will be the center-forward and who will be the right-winger this season. Of course, they could be a striker duo, but then that creates all kinds of new situations.
4. Hakimi as RWB vs RM vs RB: A lot of proposed lineups I've seen have Hakimi as a true right-back, whereas he seems to shine a lot more as a wing-back or even right midfielder. As we saw in the first game against Troyes, he can score and attack very well (even better than he can defend, in my opinion) and it seems like a misuse to have him in a true defensive role. The issue is that having him in a wingback role means playing 5 at the back, which brings us to the next issue.
5. Kimpembe/Marquinhos/Ramos: Kimpembe and Marquinhos have been a great defensive pairing for the last few seasons, but the arrival of Ramos means a few scenarios are possible. First, they could all play as the center backs of a 5 at the back formation, but that would mean only having two midfielders. Second, Marquinhos could play as a CDM (which he's stated he doesn't like) with Ramos/Kimpembe as the CBs. Or, Ramos and Marquinhos could be the CBs and bench Kimpembe, which seems like a waste of a rising star.

In conclusion, the embarrassment of riches which has come our way this summer is a wonderful thing for the club, and it raises some good questions about team management. This issue isn't new at all (Kepa/Mendy at Chelsea and basically all of Man City), but I wanted to get your thoughts on what would be the best plan this year.",psg,Potential Lineups,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/p3a7eg/potential_lineups/,2021-08-13 06:13:32

Charming-Bread-247,1628689194.0,p2d9mf,5.0,1.0,"I'm a Barca fan, a die-hard Cule.  Hola! Parisians. I don't know where and how to start, it has been a big roller coaster ride. it all started 5 years back before that Roma debacle that was my first UCL and why did I watch IT? before that I really don't have any truck with football, As an Indian, I really had no knowledge about football and used to think that people just run after a ball that's it; Then something called Messi happened to be on my Instagram feed and everything started to seem so simple and things started to unfold. I didn't need a single cell of my brain to use, it was so simple and sleek.

I got to know Barca is Messi and Messi is Barcelona, it was incredible that a man can get so much love from people all around the globe. He taught me to be fuckin loyal and do whatever you love (fun fact: if it up to Goerge Messi he would have left Barca ages ago). He made me Fall in love with Barca. From that day till this day all I saw was debacle upon debacle and seeing match after the match made my heart go sobbing.

I'm still a cule and how much I try I can't deny that, all the hardship we had in past made me fall even more for it, but unlike others, I'm very much open to football I can not whine about stuff about which isn't in my control what if PSG have a lot of money what's the problem just get some private investment yourself too. Barca fans have all the right to be angry on PSG and it's understandable but those PL clubs behave as they are plain slate.

Last Thursday when Barca released that statement I couldn't believe my eyes, after what Laporta was saying all the time ""things were going all fine and be calm he gonna sign the renewal"".

Till his press conference, I was in a state of denial, but then it hit me when I saw him entering the room crying like a baby I never saw him crying like that even after so many debacles, with no shame I can admit I cried like a fuckin kid man.

I was hoping for a U-turn but didn't get my hopes high.

then PSG came knocking on the door until that teaser I was all anxious and but was certain it is all done. and then that Messi teaser came out and I was for once got a smile on my face. I could be at ease after that but PSG had other plans they kept throwing better and better teasers, and that announcement video giving a tour of the stadium I had nothing but all my respect for the creative director of the video. 

This transfer means a lot to football, Messi get's to meet his friends as well as making few fantasies come true like Ramos defending for Messi, it also makes happy to think that this gonna increase the appreciation for the greatness of all time to touch the ball from to two fanbases now, and the fact Ramos gonna be with Messi also helps Messi get even more appreciation from few more RMA fans.

&amp;#x200B;

MESSI WAS OUR PRIDE, THE EPITOME OF LOYALTY, OUR BIGGEST FLEX

but It has finally come to an end but I guess I was just being selfish all along if he is happy that is all I want and in his presentation, it felt like a big relief seeing him smiling.

&amp;#x200B;

Johnn_Davis,1628621632.0,p1vpbm,2.0,1.0,"***After a whirlwind few days, Lionel Messi officially signed with French club Paris Saint-Germain. Here‚Äôs what we can expect from the Argentine superstar going forward.***¬†

Bienvenue, Lionel!

Lionel Messi is officially gone from Barcelona and now a member of PSG after signing a two-year deal with the club.

The agreement, which was officially reached on Tuesday, includes an option¬†for a third season, a person with knowledge of the negotiations **told The Associated Press**.

The move by the 34-year-old striker was no surprise given that few clubs could afford Messi‚Äôs price tag. Funded by Qatari sovereign wealth, PSG has a star-studded roster going into this season. The team includes Brazilian striker Neymar, a former teammate of Messi‚Äôs at Barcelona, and French winger Kylian Mbappe.  


The six-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner, and Copa America champion with Argentina just last month, now joins what is considered the best front three in the world. Messi **left Barca** because of what the club said were ‚Äúfinancial and structural obstacles.‚Äù As a result, that makes PSG a top contender to win their first Champions League in history.

With the signing official, here‚Äôs what we can expect from Messi going forward.

## Messi will play on the right as part of the front three at PSG

Messi, a playmaker, has traditionally drifted to the right. He‚Äôs very likely to play in that very same position with either Neymar on the right or as a center forward. Neymar and Mbappe, who prefers to play on the wings, could alternate in that position.

PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino likes to use a 4-3-3 formation so a front three with Messi in it isn‚Äôt too much different from what he had at Barca. The big difference in Paris is that Mbappe is a magnificent finisher. That means Messi has some options here whenever he gets the ball. He can provide assists for the French star or bang in a few himself.

## Getting along with Neymar

This can be a touchy subject. Neymar, who wears the No. 10 jersey at PSG, left Barcelona in 2017, in part, because he wanted to be the big man on whatever team he played for. That was never going to happen at Barca as long as Messi was there.

Four years later, the two are reunited and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to feel so good. It could add some problems to the dressing room and it will be up to Pochettino to manage egos. In public, however, Neymar has always sang Messi‚Äôs praises and appears genuinely happy to have him as a teammate again.

## Finally win the Champions League

PSG has spent lots of money in order to win the Champions League. It hasn‚Äôt worked, despite reaching the final as recently as last year, but that could change by the end of this season.

For PSG, winning the league just isn‚Äôt enough and doesn‚Äôt justify the expense. The Champions League has proven tricky for clubs that spend a lot of money like Manchester City.

Messi, a four-time Champions League winner, does bring lots of experience to this PSG side and is now part of a devastating attack. There can potentially be lots more glory in his future. It remains to be seen if this entire investment project will bring with it European glory.",psg,Messi signs with PSG: What we can expect from him next,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/p1vpbm/messi_signs_with_psg_what_we_can_expect_from_him/,2021-08-11 02:53:52

I am a huge Messi fanboi, started watching him in 09, already knew he is the best player in history.

He got me back into football after R9 career went downhill.

I have the Messi/Jesus T shirt with 6ballondors, my son is named Leo, everybody from my environment 

knows I am THE Messi balllicker

I have no shame saying I support PSG now because of Messi.

I've changed my Facebook Background from the famous Messi La Remontada picture, to PSG Logo.

Clubs are fictional, Players are real. So that's why I always supported Messi in the first place.

Second place for me was Barca and then Neymar.

I'm glad they meet together at PSG.

We were working on Pogba/Camavinga/Hernandez this whole time and all of a sudden, it‚Äôs all about the Messi drama. He didn‚Äôt even want to come in the first place.
We have a Champions League we‚Äôve been running after for a decade now. We have the squad to do just that but also a lot of loose ends to tie up. 

Let‚Äôs not shoot ourselves in the foot when so close to the goal. Messi has never been and will never be a priority. The Champions League is. PSG is more important than any player alive. Even bigger than the great Messi. Remember, we beat him last season without our best player. We beat him in our 2017 home game with no superstar, right before the robbery that‚Äôs known today as the ‚Äúremontada‚Äù not because Messi was stellar, but because Neymar was.

\#1. 3-4-3 against better sides:

Neymar Mbappe Messi

Bernat Verratti Gueye Hakimi

Kimpembe Marquinhos Ramos

Navas

Marqui roaming as a 6 and central defender in the 3-4-3. Navas vs Donnarumma should be picked based on form

\#2. 4-2-3-1 against low blocks in the Ligue 1

Mbappe

Neymar Messi Di Maria

Verratti Marqui

Bernat Kimpembe Ramos Hakimi

Navas

Diallo would replace Bernat until he comes back.

Players who will regularly compete for starting spots / substitutes:  Wijnaldum, Paredes, Icardi, Donnarumma, Di Maria, Danilo and Diallo 

Players who must be sold before the window closes: Sarabia, Rico, Rafinha, and possibly Herrera. 

I don't think PSG can do much more this window other than selling the players mentioned above or more,  + potentially going for camavinga, a backup LB (if they sell kurzawa) or a backup CB (if they sell Kehrer)
