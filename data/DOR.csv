True_Chosen_One_1111,1601386452.0,j1zaij,48.0,1.0,I'm a BVB supporter and will keep on being a BVB supporter forever. But what makes BVB special? What is that one single ingredient that makes us hope for something big like our own Leagure title or Champions League? I'm a 17 year old and I don't understand football tactics or strategies or formation that much. But I want to learn about it. I want to become a die-hard Dortmund fan. Because I fell in love with its logo and jersey the moment I saw it for the first time a year ago.,borussiadortmund,What is Dotmund's specialty?,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/j1zaij/what_is_dotmunds_specialty/,2020-09-29 21:34:12

Finally got around to putting a frame on this poster I got in Dortmund last year. It was posted outside a shop on Lindemannstraße. I went inside, told the shop owner I was visiting, and asked her if I could give her money for it. After 10 minutes or so of me offering more and more for it and her declining she eventually, and kindly, offered it for free. I was very grateful and said I would buy €20 of goods from her shop in exchange (I hope that was a fair trade to her).  

I love it since it's a unique reminder of my visit plus I really like how the designer incorporates the look of the stadium pre-renovation and the old badge. 

Anyone know who would have made this? Are there similar or unique posters for each match hung around the city (this was my first time in Dortmund and first match)? Anyone else have BVB matchday posters they would like to share on this thread?",borussiadortmund,Matchday Posters,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/j1f5qh/matchday_posters/,2020-09-29 00:23:02

BVBFan420,1601261752.0,j149of,7.0,1.0,"I know we are coming off a really bad week and all of us are already looking forward to the next matchday but Jesus! The Bundesliga is one of the most competitive leagues. A lot of believe that Dortmund and Bayern are the only teams that had a shot at the title but that's not always the case. I don't think we should judge a league by how hard it is to win the title but rather the quality of play week in and week out. This week we saw both Bayern and Dortmund lose games they should have won. This is terrible for us and Bayern but props to both of the teams who showed that this isn't just a two-horse race. Bayern are a damn fine team and they play some of the best football in the world but everyone in this league can upset anyone in a given day. Germany is often overlooked by Spain and England but we have some of the most loyal fans in the world, teams, and players. I'm really excited for the future of the Bundesliga as a whole. I just wished teams like RB didn't make the BL become more like the PL (through private company buying clubs) but the heart is always there for each team. This might be a controversial opinion but the smurfs - as much as I hate them - they are working class good people. If they relegated I'll miss having the derby. I just hope the Bundesliga doesn't become so commercialized. Sorry as this is bit of a rant but I'm really excited about the prospects of the league.

If we fault the players, what is the solution if not for the manager removing these players from the equation?

TabulatorSpalte,1600879545.0,iydt1m,4.0,1.0,"As some of you may know, Mats Hummels and his brother Jonas and a friend co-host a podcast. In episode 29 “Tschick” Mats shares some of his thoughts and some predictions of the new BuLi season. 
If you speak a bit of German, I recommend listening to it. 

Here is a short summary for anyone not speaking German. 

Match against Gladbach: Some jokes about the penalties were made, but Mats mainly talked how much he missed the fans (he talked about having goosebumps). He hopes that the current rules can be kept. 

Title contenders: Mats doesn’t think that there are really five clubs competing for the Schale, it’s going to be between Bayern, Dortmund and to some extent Leipzig. 

In addition to the mentioned three, his top five also include Gladbach and Leverkusen.

Gladbach have had too many injuries during season start and they lack depth. Leverkusen weren’t title contenders last season and they won’t be this season after losing Havertz and Volland. 

Worst unexpected team: Werder was mentioned for last season and one of the other host suggested Schalke for this season. The hosts agreed though that their bad performance doesn’t really come as a surprise. They haven’t won a single match in 2020.

FrostyRuby,1600667273.0,iwuksj,0.0,1.0,"Hello! I’ve posted this two separate times in comments as watered down versions, but wanted to bring this directly here as a post also for everyone to see. Ever since following the sport myself, I have been a Liverpool fan since day one. Always stuck around watching the EPL, Serie A, and some lower league English matches. I soon realized Bundesliga was on its way to the platform. This got me quite excited as I have never watched a full Bundesliga match till yesterday. Picking the first match for myself to watch was quite the easy choice, thought why not go for Dortmund’s fixture due to well you know why. I must say, right off the bat I was impressed! About 10,000 fans and the quality of sound coming out of the TV was surreal. I’ve seen clips and highlights of what it is like, but watching the match first hand and hearing it alongside is totally different. I look forward to when everything returns to normal and I can very well watch the full atmosphere in action. The football also was also amazing to watch, giving joy as an American to see a young starlet shine and have a boost of confidence from it too. Overall I rate my experience watching my first ever Bundesliga match as a solid 10/10. I look very much forward to the future fixtures and getting to further follow this team well into their season.

#**FAQ**

**Q. What is this thing?**

It's a competitive score prediction game for the Bundesliga, and if you're reading this you're invited! 

Basically, each week you add your best guess about how the Bundesliga fixtures will end. The better your predictions are, the more points you get.


**Q. Where do I play / register for this thing?**

The game is live at [http://www.kicktipp.de/r-bvb-2020/](http://www.kicktipp.de/r-bvb-2020/), and if you haven't yet you have to register at [http://www.kicktipp.de/r-bvb-2020/mitgliedwerden](http://www.kicktipp.de/r-bvb-2020/mitgliedwerden) before you're all set.

**Q. Is this available in German only?**

The prediction game is available in English and German, as well as a number of other languages. If your preferred language option does not appear at the above-mentioned URLs, try [http://www.kicktipp.com/r-bvb-2020/](http://www.kicktipp.com/r-bvb-2020/) and [http://www.kicktipp.com/r-bvb-2020/mitgliedwerden](http://www.kicktipp.com/r-bvb-2020/mitgliedwerden). Alternative language versions can be accessed from the bottom left corner of the website.

**Q. How do I play?**

Visit the [prediction centre](http://www.kicktipp.de/rborussiadortmund/tippabgabe) site every week before a Bundesliga match day. Enter what you think are the most likely results *for all fixtures* - not just the ones that Dortmund are playing. Depending on how good your guess is, you get more or less points after the matches end: 2 points if you predicted the correct winner, 3 points if you also predicted the correct goal difference, and 4 points if you predicted the exact score. **Note that you have to submit your prediction for each game before the game kicks off!**

**Q. What do I win?**

As in previous rounds the winner will get an awesome flair to display next to their name on this sub, so you can rub your superior Bundesliga knowledge into all our faces.

**Q. What about these bonus questions?**

This round once again includes two bonus questions - bonus points will be awarded at the end of the round for each correct answer, with each correct answer adding one point to your final tally. This time around we're asking: 1) ""Who is going to win the first leg (of the Bundesliga), aka who will be 'Herbstmeister'?"", and 2) ""Which team will be first to change its manager?"" **Note that you have to submit your predictions before the start of the first Bundesliga match day.**


**Q. How long will this round run?**

With the end of the Bundesliga *Hinrunde* at the end of the year the score prediction game will also end. Everyone will be able to see who's won during the winter break 2019, and we will announce the winner on here in January 2019 once we're ready to restart the game.

**Q. Can you help me remember to submit my predictions during the season?**

We'll be including links in our pre-game threads again - if we remember :) Also, get the app ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kicktipp.mbookmark) | [iphone](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/kicktipp/id570703120?mt=8))!

**Q. You left it stupid late this time with this announcement!**

Yep, sorry about that. We had different plans, but sometimes life finds a way to intervene. Sorry!

*I copy-pasted this entire post from the last announcement, but this still seems extremely relevant*

**Q. I have more questions!**

Here it is. The first official game of the 20/21 Season. We will face MSV Duisburg who we have faced a few weeks ago in the ""Cup der Traditionen"" and won 5-1. I am sure tho that neither us nor Duisburg actually showed everything they have in store and esp. Duisburg will play very different tomorrow.

Dortmund's a club thats always been genuinely interesting to me from afar, and this season there appears to be a lot to be optimistic about (Sancho, Håland, Reyna as individuals for example.) Those are all really easy to spot no doubt, and outside of beating a certain club that finished 12th this past calendar year, I wanted to ask the fans themselves what they want from a new season. I know there's some obvious answers, but what do you think are some reasonable expectations and goals domestically or in Europe? Are there any other members of the squad you'd like to see break through or perform well? How do you feel about the trajectory of the club? All and any answers appreciated! It's hard to gauge from the outside so as far as reddits concerned, this seemed like the best place to ask :)",borussiadortmund,What're you hopeful for this upcoming season?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/ioz75v/whatre_you_hopeful_for_this_upcoming_season/,2020-09-09 02:32:26

One reason is probably the fact that we are a public club and we can't go around splashing the cash. Personally, I love our transfer policy. I like that young players here don't have a HUGE price tag behind them that will haunt them. It seems like the biggest indication of value is your ability on the pitch and not some number. Should Dortmund change it's transfer policy and buy star players in order to challenge for the major trophies? I think what makes Zorc and Watzke so special is how they can manage a buy low sell high policy while also bringing in established players who challenge for the title on a regular basis. So what do you guys think? Should Dortmund change its transfer policy to become more like the big clubs or should we keep it the same?",borussiadortmund,Let's discuss: Opinions on Dortmund Transfer Policy,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/iokn9c/lets_discuss_opinions_on_dortmund_transfer_policy/,2020-09-08 09:38:50

Marc-Watson_2112,1603658547.0,ji0r7s,17.0,1.0,"I was curious what everyone thought about the current situation with Roman Bürki? 

In Germany there's a lot of attention being put on the fact that he didn't play the last couple of games while it seems that he was fit. Favre's answers weren't received as completely believable when he mentioned that it was indeed Bürki's fitness that kept him out of the starting lineup. His follow up answers and the fact that he won't publicly call Bürki his number one, is making for more speculation. He just said as much as that Dortmund have two very good goalies, that every player has competition, and that we will see regarding future games. 

I've been thinking about this situation and sort of came to the conclusion that this has nothing to do with how Favre actually feels about Bürki and that he does see him as his number one. Considering that Hitz, Bürki and Favre are all Swiss, I think there's a deeper aspect to it. I think Favre has a lot of respect for Hitz as well and that he doesn't want publicly demean him by immediately calling Bürki the guaranteed numero uno just because he's fit again. I believe that the Swiss have a bit of an honor and respect thing going on in their culture and that Favre would think it's disrespectful to treat Hitz as an inferior goalie. Besides all of this, it's of course also good to keep Bürki hungry by reminding him that there is indeed competition. As much as I like Roman Bürki, I never feel as safe with him compared to the years with Weidenfeller.

medude698,1603087687.0,jdwc84,7.0,1.0,"A big Borussia Dortmund fan here. Just wanted to discuss something. 
Borussia Dortmund plays a 3 man defence with wingbacks. Recently 3 man defence is quite popular among many of the top teams in the club soccer. Borussia Dortmund has been great at defense (only conceding 2 goals, so far), but has not been quite good at attack (without brilliance of Haaland).
 Let's leave individual brilliance aside. I just wanted to share an idea about breaking low blocks which many teams struggle to. 
I believe the key to breaking low blocks is stretching out the opposition and breaking down their discipline + overloading the box. The fullbacks/wingbacks have to take the responsibility of attacking the opposition rather than defending our area and stretch out their defense. This would lead to possibly breaking down their discipline. Then try to overload the central area (with our front 3) and Bellingham/dahoud. Yes this system would be more prone to counter, but the 3 man defense would have to take that responsibility of stopping the counters.

In the mail to season ticket holders inviting them to put their names into the lottery for the game it said further information would be provided on Monday this week. Now it's Thursday and I still haven't seen anything.

In the mailing it also said that only fans from cities/counties in our state with less than 35 new cases per 100.000 inhabitants in the last 7 days would be admitted. Dortmund currently has 50,7 and the whole state has 45,05. In my estimation there are only 3 rural counties somewhat in the vicinity of Dortmund that are still under the threshold.

https://www.tz.de/stars/mats-cathy-hummels-fc-bayern-borussia-dortmund-funkstille-liebes-aus-trennungs-geruechte-love-island-90063050.html

In case you don’t know who Cathy Hummels is, to sum up her whole identity and character you basically only have to know that’s she’s miss Bayern Munich 2008.
She hasn’t worked a day in her life, her “job” is being an influencer, but she isn’t even good at that. For her vlog diary for the World Cup 14 she received nothing but mockery. She’s the epitome of the Munich Schickeria it-girl, that’s why it was rumored she was the one who forced mats’ move back to Munich.


Personally I’m just glad that this person who characterizes the exact opposite of what our club stands for is in no way associated to us anymore. I wish all the best for Mats who seems like such a down to earth dude.

(posted with permission from the mod team)

Hey guys. Me and a couple of guys just starting a little PS4 FIFA 21 community. Based in Europe, Northern Africa &amp; Turkey.

Our idea is to organise tournaments. Over the next 2 weeks, we're doing our first tournement.

We're starting small. The idea was to have an 8 player tournament. 2 groups of 4 teams, but at the least moment we had a drop-out.

So we're looking for at least one replacement who's willing to play 3 to 5 matches.

Rules are simple. Like the World Cup, but with Club teams and only 8. With a max rating of 4 stars.

1. Return shipment for a refund
2. Reorder the item

Problem is I live in Singapore, so shipping was €20 the first time. I don't mind having to wait and all, but with the first shipping fee and what I believe to be the same for the second, I can almost use that money to buy another hoodie. I've tried emailing them (service@bvbfanshop.com) but it's been a week and still no response.

linmodon,1608333983.0,kfwbuq,18.0,2.0,"After seeing today's and the last games I came to the world breaking conclusion that the team composition is the biggest problem. Right now we have three group of players on the field:

Old/experienced: reus, hummels, witsel, piszczek schmelzer

Best ager: meunier, Delaney, Guerreiro, Brandt, hazard, can, akanji, Schulz, dahoud

Kindergarten: zagadou, Reyna, Bellingham, Sancho, haaland, moukoko, Morey, reinier.

Who of them are really leading the team on the pitch? What I can see right now there is hummels, can and haaland. Guerreiro and reus don't lead with their personality but their plays.

That's what the team is really missing. Leaders on the field, best example imo is Thomas Mueller, but not the one we are seeing now, but when he wasn't as good, several years ago. Even then he had an impact with his willpower. Who of the best agers could fill this role besides can?

Not one of them. Especially Brandt is a big disappointment. With both reus and Sancho in a slump he should be the one stepping up. But he is even worse. I don't know exactly which of the last games it was, I think it was against zenit, where he really stood in our own penalty box while Zenit had the ball control and he fixed his socks. How is that the behavior of someone wanting to win? He is in his 7th Bundesliga season.

But he isn't the only one. Besides Guerreiro and maybe can there is no one in the best ager group really delivering at all. 

Why is that? Because they have the wrong profile for this group. The need leadership players. Not some technical gifted player. Someone that can lead the young players to success. What is your opinion on that?",borussiadortmund,Team composition,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/kfwbuq/team_composition/,2020-12-19 07:26:23

ZZZ0330,1607923900.0,kcrih4,8.0,1.0,"I would say,

Guerreiro, as I think he reached his peak while playing under Favre. While he was good under Tuchel as a CM, from Favre's second season he became our key player. Favre's fluid possession-based attack really allowed him to perform, roam around, and maximizes his flair and creativity.

Reus. Although he didn't play well this season, Reus was really amazing in the first two seasons of Favre, especially after he moved him to CAM, which he was really food at, particularly at the latter stages of his career and as his speed drops.

Paco Alcácer, he had an incredible season for us, which many may not have predicted. I think our tactics utilized his off the ball movement really well.

Sancho, JBL, Hakimi, Reyna, Bellingham. Favre is undoubtedly great at developing talents, and making them look great. Also I'm amazed at how quickly he gives Gio and Jude the chance to play in the first team. JBL looked really promising in the first season, but hasn't been able to perform in Hoffenheim.

On the other hand, I feel that Brandt kinda suffered because of Favre. Of course some are his own fault of being not consistent and lazy sometimes, but Favre insistent on playing him at different positions including striker would never really be beneficial for him and the team. Oh and also Weigl but it seems like he only works under Tuchel's 433. And Kagawa who was forced out of the team, but it's understandable as he is declining.

Also recall Favre's Nice team, players like Balotelli, Cyprien, Seri, Koziello never really played up to that level after again. I can't for sure say that players like Guerreiro, Bellingham, (and to some degree Hakimi) will play as good in another team or some different tactics, but I hope our next coach can play then well.",borussiadortmund,Which player benefitted the most from Favre and his tactics?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/kcrih4/which_player_benefitted_the_most_from_favre_and/,2020-12-14 13:31:40

Sarrazin,1607857974.0,kc8wwr,19.0,1.0,"**TLDR: Kehl seems like a huge gamble as Zorc's successor. Would Mislintat be a safer bet?**

This might be controversial and certainly tinged with a heavy dose of recency bias, but I've been thinking about Zorc's succession plan recently. That's a question that's at least as important if not quite as urgent as the coaching debate. In short, I'm not sure if Kehl is really our best option.

Inspired by the result yesterday and the great development Stuttgart have had, I'm thinking that bringing back Mislintat in 2022 could be a worthwhile option.

First of all about Mislintat. He knows our club and most of our scouting apparatus. I don't think too much has changed in recent years apart from Pilawa replacing Mislintat as head scout. Mislintat has plenty of experience as a scout, has worked at a big club abroad and has now gathered valuable and highly successful experience as the guy in charge in Stuttart.

I don't think any bridges were burned when he left. The Tuchel drama was certainly not great, with the club basically siding with Tuchel and banning Mislintat with the training ground. But it never seemed that was the primary reason for why he left. Tuchel was already gone at that point, and from what I gather Mislintat simply sought a greater say in transfers at Arsenal, which he couldn't really get under Zorc. It didn't work out for him, which is why he left Arsenal so soon. But at least our split with him seemed fairly amicable.

Now to Kehl. He is without a doubt a great guy and a club legend. But is sporting director at Dortmund really an entry level position? Yes, he has been working at the club for a bit now, but his job description is *very* different. And I don't think sitting in on the discussions between Watzke, Zorc, Sammer and Favre is sufficient preperation. He has never led a negotiation, never even really had to make the ultimate decision on any sporting matter. He never had to deal with a bastard like Raiola or a buffoon like Woodward.

Now the comparison to Zorc is very salient. Zorc went from his role as a player almost immediately into his current position without any prior experience. You may say it worked out with Zorc, why wouldn't it with Kehl who at least had some more training? Maybe it would. However, it should be noted that Zorc had a lot of doubters (not without reason), basically all the way until Klopp. That's 10 whole years before he was universally seen as secure in his role. Can we afford and stomach a fraction of that patience with a new sporting director?

Granted, Zorc's position in the post-Sammer era was extremely difficult, to a degree we hopefully will never face again. But there's still significant challenges ahead, and the expectations grew as well.
Ideally Zorc would find a perfect coach within the next 6 months, who together with a stable squad leaves Kehl a stable legacy and little need for action for years to come. But given our recent history, how likely is that? The coaching question is likely to stay with us for a while, and the squad has a lot fo questions mark coming up as well.

I don't know how feasible Mislintat would be. It's almsot guaranteed that with Kehl's recent extension, there were certain assurances with regard to 2022. Going back on that now would certainly rankle Kehl and I doubt we would do that. But maybe nothing is set in stone, and both can agree that it would benefit both sides if Kehl gathered experience in a lower pressure environment elsewhere and then we say if can't find a way to work together in the future.

Anyway, just some ideas and food for thought. I would be interested to hear your take.",borussiadortmund,Kehl or Mislintat?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/kc8wwr/kehl_or_mislintat/,2020-12-13 19:12:54

blacktiger226,1607841859.0,kc606o,51.0,1.0,"Mainly Reus, Sancho, Witsel and Brandt. The four of them returned from the COVID break as shadows of their former selves and I don't know why. 

Reus haven't really showed up in the whole of 2020, might it be age catching up to him? Fear of injury? I don't know, but at this rate I don't want him to start over Reyna or Hazard who have been working their asses off so far.

Sancho seems to be really shaken by the Man Utd transfer saga. He is afraid to take risks, he loses the ball too much. Last season it was very difficult to take the ball from him. This season he has been one of the most wasteful among our attackers. He reminds me of Messi this season.

Witsel defensive contribution has been also very lacking, he seems much slower and less aggressive. Delaney was playing much better than him and even Dahoud.

Brandt, I don't really know what to say. He has been given chances in different positions in the field and the guy seems to have no confidence at all. He had his ups and lows last season but this season, it is all lows unfortunately.

I don't know if we can change anything to salvage this season with Favre still the coach. We are still only 5 points away from the top of the league and in a good place in Europe, anyway. If it was up to me, I would bench these four for a few games until the team stands back on its feet. May be not Witsel, since Delaney got injured, but definitely Reus, Sancho and Brandt for Reyna, Hazard and Moukoko.

I'm as mad as most of you are, probably, and I don't want to extend a lot talking about things going wrong and how can we go forward. I'd like to ask something, actually: how do you see our board in face of all of these problems? Some people criticise them for not being ambitious enough, but I respect them above all, they made us bigger year by year and we can only dream of being consistently a top-10 world club today because of Susi and Watzke.

That being said, they had some issues with favre before, but always ended backing him up, and even said some weeks ago that they were happy with our progression (which makes sense since they removed the title expectation from the objectives of the season). But, the real question is: has any coach been supported like favre has? Has any club received such a myriad of players in the last windows?

Reus will not be a top earner forever and Haaland may or may not have a release clause. This winter is a great opportunity for Dortmund to secure another 2 years of Sancho.

From Sancho's perspective, his quite normal regression will likely result in alterations to his contract proposals from interested parties this winter. He will still have considerable interest but likely not at the absurd 16m+ levels because of the continued uncertainty surrounding revenue.

diomsidney,1607314611.0,k89fj0,61.0,1.0,"Reiner will get play time. He’s after Reyna in the pecking order. It’s a difficult situation, but we planned for this before his arrival. He is here to train and grow. 

If this plays out nicely, we as Dortmund get great connections with Madrid. This will allow us first choice in their youth team and 2 year player loan deals.

Witsel has been a God-sent. Simple as that.

Reus hasn’t come back to the team since 2 seasons ago. He needs to get his head straight.

Sancho is growing up. He’s very very good, but needs maturity. He’s never worked under pressure yet. We are watching this closely. We cannot sell him for that price at this age. Let him grow first.

Raschl is firmly in my immediate plans. He’s learning under number one. Witsel.

Hazard was a surprise package. Very unexpected growth curve. He’s now firmly rooted in my plans.

Brandt has been another surprise package and a God-sent.

Dahoud, at some point will start to trust his coaches. Hopefully.

Delaney has been great but unlucky with injury. He however helped shape the way the team plays. We will be very very patient.

Piszczek has been nothing short of legendary. Nothing else to add.

Hummels has been another legend.

Guerreiro trusted me when I promised him I would fit him in. He’s adapted to wing-back from wide-man. And he’s been God-sent. Way to show trust. 

Haaland is hitting his stride.

Akanji has been nothing short of spectacular, he however like sancho needs time to mature.

Zagadou has been a balanced player. I expected more from him. Trust is required for him to reach his potential.

Mateu Morey has been quite unlucky, but he’s too young to start consistently and requires a possession-rotation style of play. We play quick counters which he’s having to adapt to. 

Burki is nothing short of legendary and God-sent.

Hitz has been unlucky due to Burki’s form and status with me. He’s being trained for intensive play. He’s great on the 6 yard box, especially on the high balls. He’s adjusting to our style of expecting lots of pressure, while playing a high line.

Luca is definitely in my plans. Anyone trained by me, gets priority over fame.


As for the staff
Lucien Favre, Manfred Stefes, Edin Terzic, Mathias Kolodziej, Johannes Wieber, Matthias Keinsteiber, Florian Wangler, Frank Gräfen.
I have nothing but praises and respect for the way they have handled the past 5 years with me. God-sent.

Others not mentioned are due to space constraints and my typing fingers hurting. They however spend time with me on one on ones.",borussiadortmund,Player status,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/k89fj0/player_status/,2020-12-07 12:16:51
BVBFan420,1607289211.0,k827v7,119.0,1.0,"I saw the recent post about why Favre is the best coach according to ppg but those stats exists in a vacuum. Favre has one of the best Dortmund squads if not the best itself. We have a veteran defender who has singlehandedly carried us in some games. A goalkeeper who is definitely one of the best in the league. One of the most packed midfield (Bellingham, Delaney, Witsel, etc etc) Perhaps the two best attackers in World Football right now barring Fati and Mbappe: Sancho and Haaland. This is a Dortmund squad that doesn't lack in most cases (perhaps a backup striker, but Moukoko will fill that void) 

So why are we performing the way we are? Is Favre a bad coach? Absolutely not, I don't think he is a bad coach at all. He reinvigorated BMG and his playstyle is really sexy (When it works) But he is a bad coach for Dortmund. He is bad because Klopp won the damn league twice in a great Bayern Munich side, runners up in the UCL with a very young squad against one of the best Bayern sides. Tuchel won at least Pokal and gave Bayern a run for his money with a bad squad vis-a-vis today. Favre was given everything. Hell, even Bayern gave him their transition period (2018-19) and we lost the fucking league. We lost to shitke in one of the most important games for the Post-Klopp era. How. TO OUR RIVALS? Yet time and time again people excuse his shitty management. His horrible substitutions. 

The football god (Zorc) has given Favre everything we need and here we are celebrating ""1 point because it is better than 0"" (Favre) Why? Is this what Dortmund has come to? We are just okay with subpar results. Football is a sport for the fans and are the fans happy with this? We have seen Zorc's face many times where he just looks bored and tired

The football by Klopp and Tuchel was beautiful 

The football by Favre is banal

Now, I expect a barrage of hate but I hope people here have a critical discussion.",borussiadortmund,Why Lucien Favre is not our best coach,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/k827v7/why_lucien_favre_is_not_our_best_coach/,2020-12-07 05:13:31

Takeaways: Favre actually has the highest average points of them all at 72.5 points, and in the 18/19 he finished the team with more points than won us the Schale in the 10/11 season. Tuchel finished the 15/16 season only 3 points short of the 81 points that won us the 11/12 season, and still did not win the Schale.

I used to be very anti-Bayern because of the Der Klassiker rivalry and the competition they and Dortmund shared. But I realized that Bayern are a very good team to watch and as much as it pains me to say it, they are a top quality side and represent the Bundesliga well.

Besides, I’ve realized that the more wholesome rivalry is the Rivierderby. I think someone said that Schalke supporters are the ones who you can go drinking with and have a better historical rivalry with.

Lastly, I’ve realized that anyone who beats Leipzig are friends with us, as Leipzig are against everything that German football stands for (the 50+1 rule? not very familiar with that). I’m attempting to learn German at the moment and pick up as much as I can about Bundesliga knowledge. Any pointers/corrections are very much appreciated!

Hey everyone - in this roughly 1.75 min video, I explained Erling’s hamstring strain he picked up in training - including why it’s not a surprise, his return timeline (based off what Favre has said, Haaland’s update was quite nebulous), a silver lining, and two key risk factors moving forward. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

**Hitting the yellow wall?**

Following their recent 4-2 lost away to top 4 contenders Borussia Monchengladbach, Borussia Dortmund have now fallen to 7th spot of the Bundesliga table after 18 games played. Ever since the 5-1 defeat to Stuttgart which ultimately saw the end of Lucian Favre as manager, Dortmund has since played 7 games and has lost as many games as they have won in 3, with one rather unlucky draw against Mainz 05. Dortmund has since fallen out of the title contention reckoning, with the impressive Bayern Munich leading them by 13 points on the top of the table. Dortmund CEO Michael Zorc has even lowered the expectations for this season in stating the importance and priority of a Champions League qualification. This run of form has not shone great light onto interim manager, Edin Terzic, who is expected to leave once a permanent manager is appointed by the black and yellow. 

Borussia Dortmund’s squad is by no means an average one. Its one littered with superstars from teenage sensations like Gio Reyna, Jude Bellingham or Jadon Sancho, to season professionals like Marco Reus, Axel Witsel and Roman Burki and of course a World Cup winner in Mats Hummels. This squad is definitely good enough to be considered as a European powerhouse as they have been for many years. But this squad has ultimately underperformed on many occasions this season which has caused a downturn in form as well as morale. Key players such as Jadon Sancho and Marco Reus started the season slowly whereas the defence never looked comfortable. 

**Over-reliance on Haaland**

Dortmund has been known for their Outstanding output in attack with the second highest xG (Expected Goals) in the league with 37.6 and scoring 35 goals. Both only behind league leaders Bayern Munich with an xG of 39 and an astounding 53 goals scored. This impressive stat is mainly due to the brilliance of the 2020 Golden Boy recipient, Erling Haaland leading the line. The Norwegian international has scored 14 goals from 13 games, exceeding his xG so far this season of 10.5. This has amounted to 1.15 goals per 90 minutes, ranking second behind Robert Lewandowski in the league. Haaland has also topped the charts in npxG/90 (Non-penalty expected goals per 90) in the league with 0.80, Lewandowski comes second with 0.69. This shows that though Haaland has not been scoring as many goals as Lewandowski, he has had better quality shots and opportunities barring penalties compared to the Polish international per 90 minutes, especially when Haaland has only taken and scored 1 penalty, the latter having taken and scored 5. 

However, it can be said that Haaland has been their only reliable source of goals this season. Haaland has been Dortmund’s top goal scorer so far with 14, followed up by 3 players, Hummels, Reus and Reyna with only a measly 3 goals, respectively.  Of the 35 goals scored in the Bundesliga this season, Haaland’s goals stand 40% of the total. Of the games Haaland missed through injury, Dortmund first drew 1-1 with Frankfurt, then a 5-1 thrashing defeat to Stuttgart which marked the end of Lucian Favre, followed by a 2-1 win against Wender Bremen and lastly a 2-1 lost to Union Berlin. In these 4 games, Dortmund played Brandt, Reus and 17-year-old prodigy Moukoko as the striker but failed to replicate the brilliance of Haaland. Needless to say, Dortmund have been heavily relying on Haaland this season with his goals to stay competitive in the league, which in normal circumstances, is not enough when mounting a serious title challenge against Bayern Munich. 

**Key Players Underperforming**

Sancho has started the season rather slowly than he would have liked. Having spent the entire summer linked away to a big move to Old Trafford, it was clear that the mercurial winger was distracted given his poor form at the start of the season. Still only 20, the teenager will no doubt still have a bright future ahead of him provided that he can commit and focus on his football instead of the media. Last season, Sancho took the world by storm with 17 goals and 16 assists, attracting interests from European powerhouses like Real Madrid and Manchester United. His xG per 90 last seasons was 0.36 and achieved 0.35 xA per 90. In comparison, Sancho has had a minor drop in performance with 0.30 xG per 90 and 0.28 xA per 90. Also, Sancho has achieved a npxG+XA per 90 (Non-Penalty Expected Goals plus xG Assisted per 90 minutes) of 0.72. His numbers have dropped to 0.58 this season. His GCA (Goal-Creating Actions per 90) has also took a hit from 1.26 to 0.82 this season. However, his defensive numbers have increased this season compared to his last. Sancho has completed more tackles as well as achieving a higher tackle success rate of 36.4% compared to his last season’s 30.4%. He has also achieved a higher percentage in successful pressure percentage with 40.1% this season compared to last season’s 31.8%. Though he has struggled offensively and has not hit the high standards he has set for himself thus far, he has definitely been working hard to amend the situation. 

Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has also been poor this season with the skipper missing 2 of his penalties in crucial games against Mainz 05 and Werder Bremen. Reus has had a tough spell in the past few seasons with injuries which has ruled him out for a substantial amount of time. One of his injuries even saw him withdraw from the 2014 World Cup winning squad. It is fair to say Reus has never had the best of luck when it comes to injuries, but this season the captain has played in 17 of the 18 games, looking to put past his injury woes behind him once and for all. However, it is his quality and performances that has been the major concern for Dortmund this season. Reus has an xG of 5.6 and a npxG of 3.9, but only amount to 3 goals so far in the campaign. It is fair to say Reus has gotten in good positions and has good chances to score for Dortmund but has wasted his chances more often than not. 

**Hakimi’s replacement**

The loss of Achraf Hakimi to Inter Milan is also a key factor in Dortmund’s poor standing. Hakimi played the second highest number of minutes in the 2019/20 season with 2,715 minutes, only goalkeeper Roman Burki played more minutes. The Morroccan international played most of his games as the right midfielder and the right wing back role and excelled in Lucian Favre’s 4231 formation and the 343 position, respectively. His dynamism in the final third and his link up play with Haaland and Sancho saw him become Dortmund’s key player with 5 goals and 10 assists in the Bundesliga. Since his departure, Thomas Meunier was brought in from PSG to facilitate the Wing back role for Dortmund, but the void proved to be too huge for him to fill. Last season, Hakimi achieved an xG per 90 minutes of 0.13 and xA per 90 minutes of 0.15, whereas Meunier achieved an xG per 90 minutes of 0.07 and xA per 90 minutes of 0.13. Hakimi’s attacking output has definitely been the difference for Dortmund. 

**Goalkeeping Issue**

Roman Burki has been Dortmund’s Number 1 since 2015, the swiss international is talented with his knack for making crucial saves in crucial moments in games. However, he is also known to have an error in him just waiting to erupt. The 30-year-old has a low 25% clean sheet percentage, which is currently his lowest ever since he moved to Germany from Grasshopper in 2014. His GA (Goals Against) per 90 this season has also seen a massive surge in his stint in Germany. He has recorded a 1.62 GA over the current campaign, which is his second highest in his 10-year career thus far. Burki’s PSxG+/- (Post-Shot Expected Goals minus Goals Allowed) shows -5.3, The higher the number, the better the goal keeping abilities of the player. A positive number would suggest an above average ability to stop shots. Burki recorded his worst PSxG+/- in his past 4 seasons since the data is recorded, which suggests Burki has been error prone and has declined over the past few seasons. An error-prone goalkeeper would be much needed for Dortmund if they were to bid another title challenge against Bayern Munich.

In my opinion they are completely different types of player but I do think Locatelli would be more suitable as he is more defensive and Dortmund at the moment do need a consistent defensive midfielder. However there's one thing i'm worrying about Locatelli which was how would a totally different environment affect on him (please refer to Sorloth in RB Leipzig). Generally I'm pretty confident that we can sign him and make him the next Pirlo.

If Dortmund receive an offer for Sancho for lets just say 90m euro and take it. What will happen with Haaland then? If he also wants to leave, and Dortmund reveive an offer for about 100m euros, do you guys think they will take it? Or make Haaland stay another year. Because Haalands release clause is about 75m euros. And they would basically loose 25m euros for one year extra. 

I personally think they should let Sancho go for 90m euros (if they receive such offer) and maybe buy a replacement for about 30-35m. I mean i think Sancho himself wants to leave, so why not take a good offer. 
I also think they should make Haaland stay til atleast 2022, since hes probably the most crucial player upfront. What are your thoughts?

Last season we had some really good performances playing with a back 3 and using Reus and Sancho as “false 10s” behind Haaland, with wingbacks providing the width. Id say we have nothing to lose by trying something like:

Bürki
Pisczek - Hummels - Akanji 
Meunier/Morey - Can - Delaney - Guerreiro
Sancho - Reus
Haaland

I can’t think of another way to rapidly stabilise our defence other than a change in shape like this.

BVBFan420,1611167502.0,l1f826,0.0,1.0,"I want to preface my opinion by saying two things. I've been in this community since 2014 (this account was created recently) and I've witnessed this subreddit go through many phases. Who remembers trolls like Zman63 and judas's like FiveCeleryStalk? [This post should take you back to how things were](https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/2diqaj/group_hug_time_celebrating_3000_schwarzgelbe/)

Regardless, I am not here to talk about how this subreddit is or is not. I am here to ask all of you what we represent as Dortmund fans, what do you feel about your team? Do you want us to lose so you are able to make a point? Do you want us to win so you can laugh at the people who wanted the team to lose? This is toxic, we are Borussia Dortmund for god's sake! We represent the best in football. When fascists and Nazis wanted to intimidate our fans and others, we stood strong and rebuked them. When a maniac tried to kill our players, we comforted [our boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka2xbiBondE&amp;t=3s) And although I wasn't in Dortmund when the events transpired, so many people [gave their homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJA__ouve4A) to AS Monaco fans. This is the best of Dortmund, this is the best of us. And look, I know we are angry. I know we want to win, I know that things are horrible right now. I know we can be reactionary - full discretion, I was too with Favre at times- and I know that many of you wanted to change with him and so many of our other coaches. But come on, where is the civility? Let's stop hating each other when we express opinions that might differ in the slightest, that is not how we should represent the club. I believe we are the biggest Dortmund forum on the internet (might need a fact check on that one) and so we represent Dortmund to others. When they come here, what do they see? Chaos and toxicity everywhere. Let's not be like that, all I ask for is this:

If you are a Dortmund fan, how do you think you should treat the club? I don't want blind fanaticism as that is just pure ignorance, I just want constructive conversations about the club we hold dear. Stop blaming the Americans, stop blaming the Favre-iners and the Favre-outers. Come together under one team, one stadium, one city, one coach, two colors, 11 men, and many many million fans.

And if you really aren't convinced, go to any of the top PL teams subreddits and see how they are like. Do you want us to be like that?",borussiadortmund,It's time to stop the blind hate on Borussia Dortmund,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/l1f826/its_time_to_stop_the_blind_hate_on_borussia/,2021-01-21 02:31:42

RealWasted,1611137845.0,l16gmp,9.0,1.0,"Before I continue writing my post, I already know there will be some mad fans here, I understand why you would be frustrated but listen to my analysis before you type.

BVB is currently having a pretty hard time competing for the title, even though having one of the best youngsters in the world (IMO the best) Haaland, Sancho, and a pretty decent midfield. Dortmund although, lacks in the defensive department in their game which is why they have been slowed down so much for the title race.

I support all teams, ranging from Barcelona, to Liverpool, Bayern, BVB, I love different teams because there is no “perfect team” for me, every team has a different style of football which can be more entertaining than the other, so there’s no bias here.

Mats Hummels has an amazing background, the BVB veteran has done a ton for Borussia and their team, and I *personally* look up to Hummels myself. Although, recently Hummels has been a lot less sharp, very slow &amp; from a perspective, out of shape. I’ve seen multiple clips of him just letting defenders slide by, jogging to his marked man, and etc. This makes me mad, because I know with the potential this man has, he was once at a time one of the best CBs in the game. Don’t get me wrong, he does have his good moments, but if BVB legitimately wants to develop a title winning team, Hummels either cannot start or has to be unfortunately, cut off.

Borussia also need a more high profile, legit goalkeeper. Someone who helps command the defense is exactly what Borussia needs, so a strong and confident goal keeper would boost the confidence of the defense, thus making the defense rock solid.

If BVB is serious, IMO they need to buy new defenders, a stable left and right back &amp; work on the team spirit much more.

There is also no team spirit in the defense and midfield. Haaland Sancho and Reus do connect perfectly, but the rest of the team is lacking. This is seen in games, where when they lose the ball, every man is for themselves and they do not communicate about who to mark. Mistake leads to chance, chance leads to goal, and this is why BVB is being crushed.

Let’s be honest, Borussia right now, do not want to win..they’re playing their worst football in a while and if it continues like this, I wouldn’t really know what to tell you.

Borussia also needs to **STOP selling their talents**, Borussia produces some of the worlds best footballers just to sell them and fail horribly without them, this is a big problem as I fear Haaland will be sold soon, because BVB have a trait of doing such things.

I also don’t want to make it seem like BVB is some relegation team, they are still world class, but have a few things that are holding them back from throwing Bayern off their thrown.

I can't see us going all out and splashing the cash on a star for obvious reasons and I really hope we don't go for an absolute nobody either. What do you guys think about Wamangituka? He's obviously having a great impact on Stuttgart and his numbers look great and of course he plays on the right side. I won't pretend like I've seen him play a lot, I have probably watched him play maybe 3 or 4 times but to me anyway he seems like a decent option to think about and I can't see him costing more than 30-40m if he continues his good form.",borussiadortmund,Sancho replacement,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/kyu497/sancho_replacement/,2021-01-17 07:30:18

into_the_vast_cosmos,1610799381.0,kyhygj,3.0,1.0,"Oriol Domenech (tier 1 for Barça and Ajax transfers) [tweeted last week that Raiola will be trying his best to place Haaland at Barça and that he's interested in maintaining relations with Barça](https://twitter.com/HagridFCB/status/1349128328335265793?s=20) .

Raiola is an agent who fights for whatever his client wants(eg. Pogba and United, Zlatan and EA). The fact that he said this, shows that probably Haaland himself has told Raiola he's interested in Barça.

As a Barça fan this is amazing to hear, but it's hard to understand why Haaland would be interested in Barça. We've had a shambolic past 3 years and we're in a dire financial situation right now. Not the type of place an upcoming goat like Haaland would even consider. Maybe it's just something with his special mindset. Being the son of a profootballer definitely means he doesn't think like other players.

You guys know more about how he thinks than anyone else so please tell me, would Haaland actually consider Barça even with its current situation? Was Raiola just speaking about what he wanted?

Things to consider:- 

Barça has really been getting better since the end of the UCL groups. Koeman has started figuring things out.

We have a great bunch of young and loyal players who are around Haalands age and could peak together with him. (Fati, Pedri, Araujo, Puig, Mingueza, Dest, Dembele, Frenkie).

Because of that, would someone explain how he ended up at Dortmund, how he played, what led to him leaving, etc...? I think I read some of it had to do with the bus attack before the champions league match but wasn't sure if there were other details.

Unfortunately, they're not exactly selling them on the Nike store. I've found yknow Chinese wholesellers for a knockoff which I'm not all too fussed about rolling the dice on (I mean, it'd be pretty hard to find one manufactured during the 90s, I assume). Preferably Kalle, Ricken or Stefan. I'd take Susi tho ofc.

I really appreciate it if any of y'all can point me in the right direction or can vouch for any site in particular. Again, if it's just a matter of rolling the dice I'm willing to do that but thought I'd consult somebody else first.

DanishGoat,1610126259.0,kt6xn6,19.0,1.0,"Alright, so in my opinion one of the positions we are having trouble with atm is right back. Piszczek is leaving at the end of the season, Meunier has not been convincing and is not a long term prospect. Morey is promising but I'm not convinced he has what it takes, not for now at least. I wish Passlack would finally get his breakthrough but it seem unlikely to happen.

So, in my opinion we should be looking for a new right back, preferably one similar to Hakimi as he worked really well.

The player i have in mind to take that spot, is Youcef Atal from Nice in France. He's fast, dynamic and a good dribbler. I don't follow french football in depth, but he started this weekend for Nice. He's also still young(24) and can play as both right back and right wing.

vavarsam,1609890963.0,krb9m6,51.0,1.0,"Hello! Im a big fan of BuLI but im not a big fan of any team (except european games excluding S04 and Werder), im just enjoying the league. I've heard from my friend that BVB fans ""hate"" Lewandowski. I tho its just a bullshit but then i started wondering how it looks like - may You answer me please, what is your real attitude toward Lewy? I cant get why would you dislike him that much because he wasn't creating problems everywhere like Dembele only to create opportunity for leaving. Im not sure but i think that he wasnt doing any serious promises about his future at BVB. His attitude was irreproachable in the last round when he knew that his future is Bayern. 

When he left You he wasnt celebrating goals against You only at 1st match iirc but lets be honest if he would be supposed to control celebration all the time when he scores - that would be a many times after many years. I think we can erase this reason in case of your potential ""hate"" towards Lewandowski.  

And the last but not least, he was just fucking good. He wasnt a best player in the world like in 2020, sure, but he was a very very important part of the team that gave You your last victories in the league and Champions League Final. Beautiful memories for a Club's supporter for sure.

Maybe im wrong but i dont remember any shittalks, any dirty comments or any disrespect told against You by Lewy.

As we celebrate the start into the new year in a socially distanced manner, I'm sure this is not the only thing no one would have predicted at the start of 2020. A decent start to the year came to an abrupt halt when Covid stopped the league - and our lives in general. More recently, the Favre era came to a similarly quick stop, with Terzic taking Borussia Dortmund now into 2021. As poorly as 2020 was, in many different ways 2021 is looking bright again!

Normalguy05555,1614030356.0,lq0vy1,14.0,1.0,"I'm not here to fight, but to point out something I've realised over the years in this beautiful club.

From that Champions League final to that horrendous 5-0 defeat against Bayern in 2019, I keep asking myself: ""what does it takes to win?"" I mean BVB is not a small club, we've got the best fans in the world and right now, the best striker (Haåland) and a group of the best youngsters in the planet (Brandt, Reyna, Bellingham), outstanding players like Sancho and Hazard and some very exceptional veteran players (Reus and Hummels).

With all that, I still don't understand why in 10 years we've only won the League one time and we cannot compete against a bullish Bayern Munich, who wins by stealing foreign talent.

Der Klassiker is supposed to be a show of the 2 best sided in Germany, but now it's just a ridiculous spectacle for Bayern fans, as they almost always trash our team.

I don't get why having such outstanding players like Weidenfeller, Reus, Hummels, Schmelzer, Piszczek, Witsel, Kagawa, Gündogan, Aubameyang, Dembele, Lewandowski, Haåland and Sancho, I don't get why having them has led us to nothing.

With awful decisions made by upper management like keeping Favre far too long and bullish business tactics from other clubs, I get this mistakes but really why are we never taken seriously in title challenges? Why does every season hope dies so quickly? With those players, why can't we have a good Manager, like Klopp that time, why are we now 6th in Bundesliga and well yeah, they won against Sevilla the first leg, it would be the first time in years that we get passed the round of 16.

I just wanted to get my frustration out, I've followed this time for a while now and it's horrifying to watch it sink in the table, I really hope when Rose arrives things get better, I'll never stop supporting BVB, but I just hate watching how Bayern just won 6 trophies in a row and we're sinking in the League's table.

________________

DISCLAIMER: I'm well aware of our situation and Dortmunds standings when it comes to transfers. I know that we dont have to accept offers if we dont want to. I'm also fairly read up on our financial situation. 
________________

I've been having these thoughts on my mind for about six months now and i feel like i dont see nearly enough people talking about it. Either im missing something or you lot are all accepting our situation better than i am. 

I first started thinking of this in the start of season the but due to some decent results in the beginning i forgot about it. As soon as our results started to go south i realised that my earlier thought process may be more real than i'd imagine. 

Obviously we dont have any attendance when it comes to fans at the stadium due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I think no one has missed that. Some clubs have been hit harder than others, financially, because of this. However, i think Dortmund has been hit even harder in another aspect. The fans make a big part of every team, but for Borussia Dortmund they're a part of the absolute core that is this club. Football experts all over the world has always said, even when we havent been performing very well, that ""no team in the world, no matter how good thet are, can travel to Westfalen and expect a victory in front of the yellow wall"". It's widely known that there are no better fans than us, especially the ones screaming from the top of their lungs on the stand every single matchday. 

That's one of our two biggest sellpoints, along with the fact that we ""believe in teenagers"". We dont farm titles like other clubs do. We have one CL-title(which obviously is amazing). We've won the league three times in the last 24 seasons. In over 30 years we've won the DFB-Pokal twice. We dont have any sort of subscriptions for silverware. How come we're so massive and one of the biggest clubs in Europe then? Because we have the best fans in the world, and they create an atmosphere you wont find in any other club. 

Obviously there were a lot more paperwork to be done for the transfer of Erling Braut Haaland, but he's made it pretty clear that the fans and the stadium was a big deal when it came to signing the contract. That's something we hear a lot from other players aswell.

Where am i going with this? Well we dont have the fans any more, and we're fighting for our lives to get a CL-spot. I appreciated the attitude our boys brought to the pitch last night and thats what we need. Because without the fans, and without a CL-spot, what selling points do we even have to keep the players or even buy new ones? I saw a lot of you in the Post-Game Thread last night starting to spark the argument that we need to keep as many players as we can, obviously, but i saw a lot of weights being put on the fact that Erling Haaland can do great things for this club. He will bring players to this club that wants to play alongside him because they know he can win a lot of titles for this club.

However, my deepest fear is that the players are forgetting how it feels to be a part of the eleven people out on that pitch with the fucking thunder coming from the yellow wall, and big parts of the rest of the stadium, when they score or grab a victory. That thunder comes from beating Bayern Münich, but also when we beat a Bundesliga 2 team. The wall always provides. I think the lack of this will result in them just focusing on the results and the team in itself, come summer and the transfer window opening up. 

I think the transfer window of summer 2021 will be one of the most important transfer windows in a very long time, for this club. I may be exaggerating but thats my gut feeling. We NEED to secure and hold on to the players we actually value, no matter how much money we're being offered. I saw someone saying that ""i dont care, give Erling higher salary than Reus, just make sure he doesnt leave any time soon"". I think this applies to a lot of the players. I obviously dont want our players to all have insane wages, but i think you all get my point. 

Money is a great thing, especially during a pandemic, but i think now more than ever we need our board to have some serious ice in the veins. I have an immense trust in this club and i dont expect them to fall weak, but desperate times can cause desperate actions. We need to survive and hold on to what we got until we get our beloved fans back in those stands. 

I think we have something really special coming together if we manage to keep all the vital parts until then. 

If you've come this far i thank you for your time. Please discuss! I love this subreddit and the discussions that pops up every now and again. We have some really special people in here with a lot of insight and wisdom, creating fantastic conversations. For all of you lurking, you're special too 💛🖤

For years I've listened to us being known as Bayern's B Team or forever under the shadow of Bayern. While the latter maybe somewhat true in light of the league performances over the years, I just think we've spent our fair share of being treated as a small club. I think from that we have to move on even if it means being aggressive in the market. It's a competitive sport and even for the clubs. Some Gladbach fans haven't gotten over us buying Dahoud. Big Deal. I don't want us to be treated as a seller club or temporary home for immense talents. We have to change our approach.

Obviously I’m reminded of some Hummels comments, but I think our players deserve some praise for never landing us on the front page of r/Soccer, Bild, Kicker, etc..

smonge98,1613334407.0,ljwknw,35.0,1.0,"You probably heard of it or seen it. Jadon posted a story to his Instagram of him going for a morning run. 

Nothing special, I mean, we’re talking about his job. His job is being an athlete. He made a quick story saying it was cold outside, while running with a 5:22 time stamp. A time that is completely normal for the majority of working class people. So who cares?

The ‘Bild’ Zeitung cares. They wrote a full article: 

https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/fussball/borussia-dortmund-warum-joggt-sancho-um-5-22-uhr-durch-dortmund-75338132.bild.html

Now this is where it gets ridiculous. The headline says: “Why does Sancho go for a jog at 5:22am through Dortmund?” (-maybe because that’s what bvb pays him millions for?!)

They go on claiming that Terzic would have probably wanted him to be this awake in front of goal a day later on the pitch. 

Followed by going full Karen mode: CONTACTING THE BVB MANAGEMENT TO INQUIRE, WETHER THIS HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THEM. 

What the fuck.

And since no one answered their stupid inquiry they go on and assume it’s because the bvb management isn’t completely sure wether “video game expert” Sancho has actually been an early bird. Alluding to the possibility that he might have pulled an all nighter in front of his console. 

I’m repeating myself: what the fuck.

Seriously, we can’t do anything right these days. 

I’m not one to pull the racism card easily. But just imagine what the tenor of the article would have been if it were Joshua Kimmich posting instead of Sancho. “Wow, he puts in the extra effort needed to be a champion” “such a role model” “he gets up at the same time as nurses, such a hard worker”, but if it’s the black kid from a rough neighborhood in London, there is no way on earth he’d have great work ethic. Has probably been gaming all night, the lazy ass. Ridiculous.

His value was immense and he was recognized as such during his first months here but the appreciation has faded as has our dynamism with the ball. He was blamed for being too out of the game defensively and too passive offensively but his presence on the pitch position wise is incredibly missed.

 Our midfield is so disjointed with Jude trying to play a b2b roll and Delaney trying to cover for him that whatever we're getting in dynamism without Witsel is completely not worth it with how incredibly weak we are at CB and GK. Every attack is dangerous because these players are very mistake prone and aren't getting much cover from the players directly in front of them.

ahmed_a20,1613033904.0,lhgple,14.0,1.0,"Saw some sources stating we could have a monumental summer exodus if we don't qualify for UCL, which is looking more likely everyday. The players are:

   Jadon Sancho: 100 mil (110 mil asking price)

   Axel Witsel: 12 mil (15 mil asking price)

   Manuel Akanji: 25 mil (32 mil asking price)

   Mahmoud Dahoud: 9 mil (15 mil asking price)

   Giovanni Reyna: 38 mil (75 mil asking price)

   Jude Bellingham: 35 mil (80 mil asking price)

   Raphael Guerreiro: 35 mil (45 mil asking price)

   Erling Haaland: 110 mil (140 mil asking price)

So essentially we can get anywhere between 364 to 512 million euro. Our targets should be:

   Florian Neuhaus: 38 mil (40 mil asking price)

   Donyell Malen: 25 mil (30 mil asking price)

   Silas Wamangituka: 25 mil (32 mil asking price)

   Eder Militao: 30 mil: (38 mil asking price

   Andre Onana (assuming he buss case): 36 mil (37 mil asking price)

   Tariq Lamptey: 18 mil (25 mil asking price)

   Manuel Locatelli: 35 mil (37 mil asking price)

   Yves Bissouma: 18 mil (22 mil asking price)

   Presnel Kimpembe (Every club needs a big signing): 40 mil (51 mil asking price) 

This comes to a total of anywhere between 265-312 mil, assuming we get all of them, which we won't. But any 4 will def do.

AllwhitelikeaRacist,1612333534.0,lbhfdm,23.0,22.0,"Zorc and Watzkes are close to the club and their words carry weight. The shifting of the goals, while realistic misses the central problem of our mentality question and likely exacerbates it. Every single thing that goes into winning the league still applies. We need to go out and try to collect 3 points every time we take the pitch just like we did when the goal was to win the league.

The focus should never be on what Bayern or any other club does on a particular matchday and if we can get a manger who shares the same goals and orients the team not towards things they cannot accomplish on a single match day beyond a deciding one we can move closer to them with the club as currently constructed. Instilling accountability and clear instructions on set pieces is central to taking 3 points against any level of opponent in top flight football from league winning sides to relegation threatened ones.

I was a big Favre critic and thought going into the year with him being a lame duck would lead to credibility and buy in issues if shit hit the fan and thats exactly what happened against Stuttgart. We aren't Bayern and we don't have 3+ players on the pitch who are the best in the world in their positions. They went behind in every match for about two months straight and are sitting comfortably at the top of the table because they've bought themselves a much larger margin of error defensively. Akanji switching off on a set piece is far more detrimental to Dortmund in any given match both tactically and emotionally given the pressure on the team but we didn't have a manger capable of absorbing that pressure and keeping the team locked in on the process of winning each individual match.

It is imperative that the board identify a manger who is enough of a personality to entertain the outside and internal pressures of the stated goals while keeping the team focused on the next opponent. A simple start would be speaking only about the next opponent and not the shifting goals based on previous performances because if we're consistently working on fixing the issue of the week,   the degradation of foundational principles begins. It is clear that you don't have to sit back and play on the counter to be competitive against us and that is why I don't think there is a team in the 1. or 2. Bundesliga who wouldn't give us trouble if they were even a little bit up for it. That kind of margin is unacceptable for the talent assembled.

, I present to you: these new Dortmund 20/21-inspired lyrics to the beat of *Ni##as In Paris* by Jay-Z and Kanye West.

I've tried my best to make the rhymes and meters line up, and to include every player from the first team this season. For some rhymes, you have to stretch the pronounciation, but rappers do that all the time. I hope you don't think it's all too embarrassing, and maybe you get a laugh from a line or two.

We gotta say there's one Can, one Can only


ball so hard motherf*ckers wanna sign me


said ball so hard that United wanna sign me

first Woodward's gotta find me

what's a brace to a player like me can you please remind me

(ball so hard) this shit crazy

ya'll don't know 'bout Delaney

other teams could go 0 to 42

and I'd look at you like this shit zany

ball so hard, this shit weird

we ain't even 3rd this year

ball so hard since we here

it's only right that we'd be fair

honcho, I'm liable to go Sancho

take your pick:

Meunier

Reinier

Reyna

Marw' Hitz

b-ball so hard

got a high stock

Roman, Luca, run down the clock

Mats, Manu at center back

hidden behind that Big Zag

b-ball so hard

I'm shocked too

I'm supposed to be in lockdown too

if you played like we played

you'd be in the quarters of the CL too

b-ball so hard

let's upgrade it

Tobi, Ansgar will make it

group stages

front pages

Schmelle on for one game

ball so hard

like a wave

attacking football we all crave

left side, Guerreiro

in added time, pressure on


ball so hard motherf*ckers wanna sign me

B-V-B

B-V-B

B-V-B

ball so hard motherf*ckers wanna sign me

B-V-B

B-V-B

B-V-B


I said Mo and Marco be so silky on the ball

the chance of Toto losing it is very small

VAR is messing up another call

and when we win the chants will shake the Yellow Wall

ball so hard

B-V-B

B-V-B

ain't it J?

b-ball so hard

what's the order, what's the order,

Mat Morey?

b-ball so hard

so Nico Schulz (Nico Schulz)

Julian Brandt

ball so hard

act like you'll never be around motherf*ckers like his again


Youssoufa

another chance

take defenders for a dance

past them all without a glance

heh

I'm just sayin

Blues fans were quite right if you ask me

when they said last year that Bellingham's fantastic


what's Lukasz my Piszczek

what's Felix my Passlack

what's Axel my Witsel

what's Steffen my Tigges

UCL is the business

always got our fans nervous

went out last year to Paris

now we knocked out Sevilla

(heeh?)


[I don't even know what that means]

no one knows what it means, but it's provocative

[No it's not, it's gross!]

it gets the Haaland going!



ball so hard motherf*ckers wanna sign me


b-ball so hard motherf*ckers wanna sign me


'97 on Europe's throne

don't let me get in my zone

Westfalenstadion

don't let me get in my zone

Westfalenstadion

these other haters is lyin'

actin' like Terzić ain't fine

score goals away and at home

you know how many top talents I grow?

don't let me get in my zone

Westfalenstadion

don't let me get in my zone

Westfalenstadion

the fans are in the building

their hands to the ceiling

you know I got that feeling

like we will keep on winning

'97 on Europe's throne

don't let me get in my zone

don't let me get in my zone

I'm definitely in my zone (zone zone zone zone zone...).

I was just watching, like many of you probably have, [The most emotional moment of my career!"" | Marc Bartra - Match of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrSUiuQovdw) with Bartra.
And you will notice, all most all of the players featured there are gone now, for many reasons of course: some pushed their way out, some simply weren't good enough and or wanted out, but the fact remains: of a team that should have been as close as no team ever, after an event unlike any other, the only three still around from this game are Reus, Schmelle, Piszu, and... Roman.

And he's the reason i am making this post mostly, since he seems to be the next one that might be on the short list for a replacement, while all replacements sound only like small improvements. Is it worth it? Do we need to keep changing the core characters of this team time and time again, when it's not even the big transfer money causing it this time?

It's useless to talk about where we could be if Lewa, Hummels, Mario, Gündo, Shinji, Sahin et al never left.

But i think it might be worth considering what could be if we had held on for Bender, Ginter, the second coming of Shinji and Nuri for a little bit longer. 

Or, right now, to keep our faith in a guy like Roman, that not only is a great keeper, but is by now part of the soul of this club, instead of looking for a tiny upgrade and lose yet another bit of our hearts again.",borussiadortmund,"In a middling attempt to improve, are we losing our hearts?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/m27r8r/in_a_middling_attempt_to_improve_are_we_losing/,2021-03-11 04:35:06

Dinnertime-420,1619602753.0,n0b407,121.0,1.0,"Götze had an interview in which he spoke about Favre and that there was ""no performance culture"" the last 2 years before he left to PSV. Further he said that Favre told him that he ""simply doesnt have a position for him"" and that in his eyes ""Götze just wouldnt help the team"". 

I personally always had the feeling that Götze performed quite well, when he was allowed to play. Even in the times he shared position with Paco he was a constantly good sub at the least. So I kind of have a feeling that these comments by Götze show clearly what was the problem Favre had.

He is a genius in tactics and all that, BUT to me football is more than clinical work. A good manager creates an atmosphere where even ""the greenkeeper feels important"", while keeping the best performing players on pitch for the matches. A good example is when Akanji was in bad shape and still played every match. Making Akanji get worse instead of giving him a break to sort his head out... 

Seems he did a similar thing mindwise to Götze by handling him like he did if this is true.... I wonder how many players were affected by this kind of leadership. Imo every player (even the 3rd goalie) needs to feel important and needed...  

He somehow managed to get the players into a mindset which is far from being optimal for football with his way of strengthening EVERY opponent ""We have to be careful, They are very very dangerous"" in every PC, since a lot of matches were lost while we were playing in a kind of scared way. Even some matches we had the lead and just like a switch was flipped they started to play like scared little U16s....",borussiadortmund,Götzes comments about Favre say a lot.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/n0b407/götzes_comments_about_favre_say_a_lot/,2021-04-28 17:39:13

Man's absurdly enjoyable to watch. His ability to conquer and control the ball (even in pressing situations) paired with his work rate makes him so valuable to our team. It's a pleasure to see that his and the clubs patience is finally paying off. And it's not only his abilities on the ball, which are brilliant. He's very vocal during games, pushing his team mates, signals when to start pressing. Off the pitch he seams to be a funny and nice person, who always works hard. Hopefully Rose will trust him like Edin does, cause he seems to be that type of player, who needs it.

With Jadon Sancho finally returning from his injury, he can finally continue the blistering form he found himself in at the start of the year, it even looks like Sancho is back to his best.

I’m a new student who came to Germany a few months ago. I follow the Bundesliga since many years now so I have a fair idea about the clubs and the Fan culture is just amazing. 
So I live in Dortmund and quite close to the Westfalenstadion(been there twice but couldn’t go in due to Covid :(  ) and the city is just crazy about BVB! I see Döner shops painted in yellow and black, every 2nd car has the BVB logo at the back and many more such representations of support all over the city. Now, I want to know more about how I can get more information about future events of fanclubs or community events by supporters. I don’t speak fluent German but I don’t mind interacting as it will only improve my fluency. 
I would appreciate if someone could help me with any whatsapp groups or fanclubs which are not too extreme and suitable for a foreigner like me.

MildChancho,1619040510.0,mvpx0i,18.0,1.0,"After watching the ESPN + coverage, it felt weird hearing the announcers talk so poorly of Haaland.  Obviously his raw goal output has been down in the past couple games, but I find it hard to worry about it too much.  Scoring is always at the focus of people's analysis of the game, since goals decide winners and losers, and since Haaland is billed as a pure scorer, when he doesn't get in the goal column, people act like its the end of the world, but there are two things that I feel are important to consider:

1. Off-ball gravity - Even when Haaland doesn't score, *he is always a threat to score,* and other teams are always aware of that.  The opposing center backs always mark him in the middle of the field, and often times when Haaland sinks into the false 9 position to receive a pass, the center back presses up right behind him, opening up the middle of the field.  Haaland takes up so much attention from the defenders, it allows the other forwards and wingers to find more space, which especially benefits Sancho and Reus.
2. Curse of Performance - Haaland has been more than prolific at scoring in his first season and half with BVB, and at this point we as fans and supporters *expect* a brace from him every game, but it would be wrong to expect this all the time.  BVB has experienced a lot of injuries, especially to our important playmakers who are part of the key to releasing Haaland.  When we can't control the ball in midfield and play him through on goal, Haaland's performance suffers.  Secondly, he is still creating chances and working himself into great spots, but these are not particuraly ""easy"" goals to score.  For Haaland it might look or seem easy, and it may feel easy for him (hence his frustration), but he is still a young player playing at an extremely elite level, this skid should not worry fans unless he really starts missing sitters or not being involved in the attack at all.  As long as he keeps shooting and drawing defenders away, I am very confident he will show up and score sooner rather than later. 

No matter what, I am going to continue to bet on Haaland every time.  He is young, but he is still an Elite Scorer and he will figure out whatever he needs to.

There's still a little bit ray of hope in my heart optimistically wishing that he might stay but if it's really the last season we're gonna see of him in a BVB shirt. Let's give him a huge send off.

AFISH3211,1619017616.0,mvhoj0,6.0,1.0,"Hello everyone my name is Adam. I have been a Manchester City fan since I was 9 years old. I’m currently 28. After the super league news I was ashamed and embarrassed and just angry about the news. From that point it might be insane but I said if this is where you truly stand then I’m done supporting this club. Absolute travesty to do this to the sport. Even though they may back out I have already switched. I told myself to find a new team and I knew in the back of my mind I was going to choose Dortmund. I love black and yellow and they were the team I almost chose at 9 years old but I chose Man City instead. 

I want to say thank you to everyone that welcomed me on one of the posts I commented on. I will be honest I don’t know the history that much at all. The only player I really really know is Reus. When I commit to something I want to dive head in and absorb as much as I can. I live in the states so I try to watch as much as I can between all my other sports teams and other activities but I’m excited to be a part of such an awesome fanbase. Maybe one day I will be able to get to Germany and see the beautiful atmosphere but that’s way down the line. I just can’t wait to talk to you all about the team and get to learn more about the history and the current players, rivalries etc.

plasticpunk92,1618915309.0,munkaz,42.0,1.0,"Hey there!


I started getting into football when I was 10 years old and Arsenal immediately became my favourite team and club to follow. This was because of their breathtaking style of football and the charisma and charm of Arsene Wenger. I knew nothing about the club's history or anything and started to fall in love with the beautiful game and how the team I admire played it.




Fast forward, I've been faithfully supporting Arsenal for the last 9 years in every way possible for me. The club will always have a special place in my heart but I just can't anymore. It is SOOOOOOO hard for me to do this but I cannot watch them play in this shitshow of a competition. Even if it's stopped now, it will only be a few years time before it's rebranded and back again. I don't want to support a football club that's infatuated with money and that completely disregards the moral and integrity of the game. So, I think that's it for me.


I know that a football team isn't something you choose or just throw away whenever you want but I cannot support a team which is basically a cash cow for an old rich white man with no spirit for competitiveness and regard for the ethos of football.





Anyways, I'm a 19 year old guy living in a third world country where local football is basically non-existent. So, I can't follow anything here. 

I'm not one to switch teams over minor things but the ESL will kill the passion and courage of competitive football as an Arsenal supporter. And I just couldn't wake up till 3 am watching the same meaningless shit over and over again.

So, I want to support a club that stands for something and is entertaining to watch. I've always had a soft spot for Dortmund over the years and have enjoyed watching lots of their games. 

And after hours and hours of watching videos and getting a feel of the club, I've decided that I'm going to be supporting Borussia Dortmund from this day forward with all my heart!

(Please tell me about must-know things that I absolutely need to know!)

WasSoEver642,1618854970.0,mu6csr,23.0,1.0,"So I think by now pretty much everyone is aware of the huge news about the elite superleague 15 european top clubs want to establish. 

I think it sucks, like every decent human beeing should, but that's not the point of this post. What I see is a opportunity we might never get again.   


At this point cheers to Watzke &amp; Co. I do not always agree with him on financial decisions and i was pretty afraid he'd join in on smth like ESL since we are one of the few clubs on the Stock Market. But this might be the best decision of his life.... IF WE JUST PLAY OUR CARDS RIGHT!

  
UEFA said that super league players cannot participate in any National Championship which will lead to a Transfer-Summer we cannot even imagine. And this might go beyond Haaland and/or Sancho staying or leaving, we might become one of the big boys with PSG and Bayern....IF WE JUST PLAY OUR CARDS RIGHT!

This might sound exaggerating but National Teams still have alot of Inflcuence, and not only that players like Ronaldo and Messi declared winning a worldchampionship as their ""Dream Achivement"", think about youngstars like Sancho, who might miss their national team just by signing for City.

This changes everything for the upcoming summer transfer period. No more selling, we need a kickass season, with an A-Team and the yellow wall in our backs to  establish us in this very changy new footballworld. 

And dont forget that the BvB is a very attractive club...if you dont care about titles. This could just Change in no time....IF WE JUST PLAY OUR CARDS RIGHT!

meinstream,1617886551.0,mmr652,30.0,1.0,"If we are going to miss out on the top 4 spots in the Bundesliga, which looks likely at this moment, I think there is a silver lining for the club as a whole.

Despite the very obvious downside of missing out on 30m+, not being able to sign some players and having to let go some other players that we can't afford, there will be some factors that we an see as an opportunity.

The most obvious one for me is, that the team is forced to move closer together. By that I mean, every organic system that is put on a diet will shed excessive or unessential assets. We will likely let go the lowest 10% of performers (Schmelzer, Brandt, Munier) and will likely have to do the same thing with the top 10% out of necessity (Harland, Sancho). This will put the focus on good team play that might benefit our build up and collective defensive efforts, because there are just no individual performers who will be able to bail us out if someone messes up.

Second, it will also give some players the opportunity to make a strong statement towards the club. We know that everyone in the team is there to play CL, but who is willing to dedicate 1 year of their career to help build up a team for the future? I doubt that the likes of Sancho or Haarland would do that, but I would love to be proven wrong. Remember what the new contract that Reus signed did for the club, public perception of us changed. Think about Jonas Hector staying at FC Koeln going down to the 2. League. 

Without ""having"" to perform against top CL teams for one season, we will have the chance to change our mindset of expectations. I think, currently the team is set up to have a fighting chance against the top 5% of teams in Europe with a winning chance of \~40%. However, it somehow came with the cost of  sacrificing our win distribution against the average BL team.  In the new season, we will likely see a shift back to winning percentage against the bell curve of the Bundesliga. IMO, this is a much more solid ground to build upon, than the current setup.  If we want to get there, we will have to revert the distribution at some cost of being less capable of beating the likes of PSG, RMA, FCB, ManCity. And honestly, if you think that we belong to that group of clubs I think you are part of the problem that created this mess in the first place. There are so many factors that separate these clubs from Dortmund, and money is just one of them. 

I think as a club, we will have to think more in terms of statistics, distributions of win likelihoods and the players that will help us to get there. I think this clip from Moneyball speaks for itself:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlKDQqKh03Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlKDQqKh03Y)

I know, Baseball is not Football but you can clearly see a trend towards system thinking in domestic leagues. Cup games are more about winning mentality in high pressure moments, but the domestic league gets more and more dominated by teams that embrace this.

I've been watching the Bundesliga for about 20 years now, and I think something has changes in the last few years. Teams with a much lower budget are able to be very dangerous to the top teams like us by exploiting our team setup that is geared towards winning against the top 5% of clubs in Europe. As an example, look at how much room our midfield has against the likes of Augsburg, Union Berlin or Frankfurt compared to teams the game against ManCity this week. While I'm not saying that its easier to beat City, I do think that there is a reason we hardly see any games with 4-5 goals anymore. These mid tier clubs don't play to win games, they play to win X points by the end of the season.",borussiadortmund,Silver Lining of missing out on the CL,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/mmr652/silver_lining_of_missing_out_on_the_cl/,2021-04-08 20:55:51

ahmed_a20,1617539966.0,mjvhoa,57.0,1.0,"Sort of like last summer with Sancho, most fans have just decided that selling Haaland for an enormous price would be better than watch speculation of him leaving and the club's stature falling continue. Some even believe selling Sancho alongside him would allow the club to start over.

While I do see the validity in that point, where we would start from scratch and a couple bad seasons such as this one wouldn't be as embarrassing, I struggle to see how the club can move forward without those 2 in our attack.

If we were to sell both of them this summer, we're looking at 200-250 million. Now to anyone, that would look like Football Manager money capable of turning a club into a dynasty, but I think it's a lot more complicated than that. If we want any chance of winning a title next season, that whole defense needs shifting and reshaping. Guerreiro is the only one I'd keep, and Hummels as sort of a player/coach character. Sad how our best defender this season is a central midfielder in Emre Can. Even then we would need proper quality to fix that defense. Players like Meret or Maignan for GK, people like Milenkovic, Skriniar, or Cristian Romero for CB, and a proper Hakimi replacement at RB such as Youcef Atal, Junior Sambia, or Tariq Lamptey. Issue is, marquee signings such as these would most likely take up that entire transfer revenue, which would leave us no opportunity to replace that attacking power, which already is difficult enough regardless of resources.

To understand that we have to know what kind of players we would lose. Haaland is arguably top 3 strikers in the world, and he's a player that can make everything out of nothing. Sancho is the kind of winger that can make any position look like a good scoring position with his passing and ball control. We lose that and what do we have in attack. We'd have to depend on Reus again and that's a lot to ask from a person going into his last few years. Brandt hasn't lived up to his potential, though I personally still hope we stay patient with him and he improves under Rose (I'm almost certain this will happen). Hazard is a decent player but just not enough to compete for titles on his own. Reyna, Bellingham, and Moukoko are all still very young and who knows if they'll be at the club long enough for us to see what they're truly made of. Then you have our U23 players such as Knuaff, Tigges, and Pherai who haven't had the opportunity to grow within the first squad and would need a couple more seasons to become class. 

Then you look at the options out there to replace those 2, and it isn't very appealing. Only good options I can see to replace Sancho would be Wamangituka, Ismaila Sarr, Mislav Orsic, Leon Bailey, or Moussa Diaby. All of which would require us to possibly break our record transfer fee, which wouldn't allow us to invest in a proper defense as we need to. As for Haaland, only Mbappe can even come close to giving us what Haaland can. People talk about Jovic, and while I do agree that he is a great player, I struggle to see how he can help us move forward. He has 3 goals in his last 8 appearances (all 3 of which came in his first 2 games), isn't starting regularly for Frankfurt, and yesterday wasn't a very good showing from him. He isn't the kind of player that can make something out of nothing, and lacks the aggression and pace that we've come to enjoy from our current attacking lineup. Should Sancho stay and Reus/Reyna/Brandt start producing the chances they should be producing, then he would be a great addition to the squad, but that condition isn't something we can rely on. Plus it would mean we keep Sancho, resulting in less opportunity to properly fix our defense. 

Then people talk about experienced players. I fully agree that we lack that in our squad, and that players aged 26+ are needed, but there is also an issue of appropriate buys within that range. The options are either class players who would cost hefty fees and demand wages the club can't afford, players who while are decent, aren't good enough to challenge for a title and would halt the progress of some the younger players by demoting them to the bench, or players who were good in the past but are now a shell of their former selves. I guess a couple of reasonable experienced players we could go for would be Stefan De Vrij as CB and Gerard Moreno for ST. 

All in all I feel that whatever happens in this window, we will see drastic changes in the way we play next season. Whether it be good or bad, we're yet to see. This is sort of my take on the situation, and I may be seeing things the wrong way.

https://aktie.bvb.de/IR-News/Ad-Hoc-News/Geschaeftsfuehrer-Investmenstrategie-neu-vorgestellt

&gt;In a surprise move, Borussia Dortmund CFO Casten Cramer announced a radical shift in the club's investment strategy today. Spurred by the ongoing Covid crisis, the club will shift key assets and invest these directly into carefully selected stock packages. ""This is simply a sign of the times - our sport is developing quickly, and we have to change with the times or else become irrelevant. Just as we were the first publicly traded club in Germany, we will now become the first publicly *trading* club in the league!""

&gt;Cramer reassured sponsors: ""We're not abolishing traditional sponsorship packages, and our VIP, Premium, and Gold Extra sponsorship tiers will remain in place for our existing global partners. But with our new global VIP partner, the popular social media platform 'reddit', we will be able to crowdsource expert advice and respond to market shifts quickly and decisively."" The goal here is clear: ""People in England always say we are a 'selling club', but our new investments will not only absorb the Covid shock, but allow us to keep our big name players. These diamond hands don't need to sell no Haaland!""

&gt;Challenged to explain some of the specifics on the new investment strategy, Cramer added: ""This is simply about making smart investments off the pitch. Our players are already top-notch, now we just need to hodl them. People say these platforms are full of rogue investors buying meme stock, but there are actually some smart people out there whose expertise we can use to trebuchet our club finances firmly into the post-Covid future."" Asked to actually list some specifics, brand ambassador Weidenfeller helpfully clarified: ""This simply works because we can buy and sell stock faster than the police allows.""

&gt;Cramer was not available for further questions, but closed with a heart-felt challenge: ""Bayern may have won the title, what, 8 or 9 times in a row now? But with this new strategy it may not be more than like 10 times in row!

I'm planning to make a season summary digital pamphlet(or booklet maybe if you guys give me plenty of things to write about!) about Dortmund this season. It's unofficial of course. I'm interested to hear your opinion about:  


1. What is your favorite moment this season? Made the Royal Milkshake feel our superiority twice this season? or when we made the Energy Drink FC looked like they need their own product?
2. Which player makes you feel happy this season?
3. Do you have any suggestions or things that I should add? Feel free to add as many as you want!  


I'm planning to finish it and post it day after match against Bayer Leverkusen, but no rush here, I will always be happy to keep myself busy if it is for our community and Dortmund!

arka_11v,1621195333.0,ndwlmh,27.0,1.0,"I would love every player to stay as we have secured UCL spot. But in the current pandemic season it looks that won't be possible. We have gentleman's agreement with Sancho so if right offer comes he will go.

Toljan is already sold to Sassuolo, Pisz is going to his boyhood club, Schmelle leaving. Balerdi might join Marseille (yet to be done)

Although we have seen Burki doing good, I do feel we need an upgrade there.

With Hummels aging we need to sign a good defender if we are going to sell Balerdi. Although we have bought 18yr old Coulibaly. I would have loved an upgrade in the RB position but I don't think we will be investing in that area for the next season. Morey, Munier, Passlack, Can. Wolf might well be experimented in RWB role. 

Our midfield is going quite good, we will be having Witsel back. So that position is sorted. We also have Raschl. Many would say to sell Delaney, but in some matches we need players like him to break opposition plays. Hoping we sign Wijnaldum on free transfer fee. (hahaha)

In the wings, Hazard, Reyna, Knauff, Wolf, Mukouko(maybe), Brandt(although he is best used in midfield but do have played there before). We should buy a Winger. Gomez, pherai should be sent to loan again.

Haaland is irreplaceable in the current form but we need a backup for him in case he is injured or need a rest. And maybe he will be leaving in the winter transfer. (just maybe). Having a good CF is the main priority according to me. Aguero/Depay would have been a great addition but I do feel both are joining Barca. So, I think Isak can be bought back.

&amp;#x200B;

CF &gt; Winger &gt; CB &gt; GK

IMO this should be the importance order to fill up these positions.

In my opinion, whatever happens in our last two games, what Edin Terzic managed to do with this team is just unbelievable. In five months he slowly but surely managed to turn this team, which had no confidence and almost never had the will to fight for it all, into something special. Ever since the Sevilla game it feels like we are watching a different team. They are running, fighting and winning games together. Yes, we always had many technically gifted players but now we have technically gifted *fighting* players. They are putting up a fight every game and that’s something I haven’t seen in this club for what feels like *years*. No matter how many titles we will win or won’t win this way, that’s the BVB I learned to love and that’s what BVB is about. To never give up, no matter how hard it is. KÄMPFEN UND SIEGEN!

Additionally Edin Terzic *breathes* Borussia Dortmund. Every single Interview he mentions how thankful he is for having the opportunity to manage this club. He travelled from Istanbul to Berlin to watch his club play the cup in 2015. He’s the Kevin Großkreutz of managers (and even better) and I really hope he’ll stay for us until Rose leaves.

I see it is only  €2 ($16.40 Trinidad and Tobago Dollars) but I mainly want to stream live games without having to hunt links and deal with the buffering and closing ads. The Cable companies in my country mainly stream EPL, UCL and La Liga. And options where you can buy subscriptions online, you have to be connected to the channel provider in a certain region. Not really trying to pay for both a VPN and Subscription at the moment (saving for my wedding) so looking to get either a platform where I can watch the games live without a cable provider and any issues, or trying BVB-TV if it is worth it. I don't really mind watching the re-live games but I honestly would prefer to get to see comp matches live. I checked through to see if there were any posts about BVB-TV and some about 1-2 years ago said it was glitchy or they didn't bother with it anymore. Just want to know if that is still the same standard from someone who actually uses it.

a few years ago I went to a small Q&amp;A event with Goetze, Schmelzer, and someone else. But the next seasons kit had just been announced that week. Someone asked the players what they thought of the new kit; The players chuckled and didn’t really know what to say.

Game one of two against Robby Bubble Leipzig. It'll be interesting to see who will play and how both teams will play. RaBa have pretty much nothing to play for tomorrow as they are pretty set on the second spot in the league and only have a VERY small chance to win the league.. and they need Bayern to lose. We on the other hand pretty much have to win every of the remaining four games(3x Bundesliga and 1x Cup).

Please support 11Freunde if possible!

&amp;#x200B;

*""I really wanted to get back on the pitch"".*

For the current 11FREUNDE issue #234, we accompanied Mario Götze at PSV Einhoven and spoke to him about his new life in the Netherlands, moments of frustration under Lucien Favre and gut decisions that he would no longer make today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mario Götze, in 2015 you told 11-FREUNDE that you often had to call yourself to order because of the hustle and bustle and the high pace of events: ""Mario, you are here right now, take notice!"" Do you find it easier to live in the moment in the Netherlands?**

Of course the media look at me differently here than in Germany, so it's a bit easier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Did this slowing down influence your decision to move to PSV Eindhoven?**

No. I've been living under a special perception since I was 19, I can deal with that. The switch was more about getting to know a new country, a new set-up, a different culture after eleven years in the Bundesliga. I always found the ""Dutch school"" interesting, PSV and Ajax play exciting football. I also enjoyed working with Peter Bosz.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now Eindhoven is less than an hour away from the German border. In your team, six German professionals play under the German coach Roger Schmidt. The culture won't be all that different.**

There are differences in terms of tactical ideas and disciplinary issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meaning?**

In the Netherlands, footballers grow up with the 4-3-3 system. Roger is trying to break down this dogma in order to be more variable. As far as discipline is concerned: I have been used to playing in a three-day rhythm for years, plus many exhausting training sessions. This intensity demands everything from me as an athlete in order to maintain the level. We have a lot of young players here, and you can't expect them to have the consistency to perform all the time. I felt the same way when I was young. I see it as my duty to lead the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Still, it was very surprising that a player with your merits would move to the Erendivisie.**

You have to remember where I came from. In my last year at BVB under Lucien Favre, I hardly had any playing time. I really wanted to get back on the pitch and have an impact on a team that plays internationally again. Because Roger has given me the central role in the team, that's possible in Eindhoven.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Roger made me feel like I could trust him completely"".*

&amp;#x200B;

**Schmidt said: ""Come to us if you want to enjoy football again"".**

Over the years, I realised how important a close relationship with the coach was for my development. I found Roger's footballing philosophy exciting, he gave me the feeling that he trusted me completely.

&amp;#x200B;

**Did you know Schmidt beforehand?**

Not personally. We had met once loosely in the summer, where he told us about his plans and expressed his interest. When, on the day of the transfer deadline, no decision had been made as to where I was going, we sat down together in Düsseldorf at lunchtime and completed all the formalities by 6 p.m. in good time.

&amp;#x200B;

How were you received by the team?

Very warmly. It was obvious that the boys wanted to play together with me. We have a small squad, after the upheaval many young players came up. Everyone was grateful to get some quality from outside.

&amp;#x200B;

*""I was never the type of leading player who constantly makes announcements"".*

&amp;#x200B;

**Do the young players ask about your great successes, about the World Cup goal?**

They ask about almost everything: about coaches, about the World Cup and, of course, how I experienced my time at Bayern or BVB.

&amp;#x200B;

**At 28, you are now a veteran in the team. How do you perceive your leadership tasks?**

I've never been the type of leading player who constantly makes announcements like a leader. For me, it's more like the principle of leading by example. I try to help the boys through my play, to be a role model instead of constantly picking them up verbally. That's just not my nature.

&amp;#x200B;

**After your contract in Dortmund expired, many clubs were talking to you in the summer. What about the offers from Inter Milan, AS Rome and AC Florence?**

There were many loose contacts. We didn't get very specific.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Beckham club Inter Miami is also said to have knocked on your door?**

That was a topic, but at the moment the move to the USA was not yet conceivable for me. I want to play in the Champions League again.

&amp;#x200B;

**You are also said to have been with Uli Hoeneß and negotiated a return to the FCB.**

We had contact, but not at his home. (Laughs.) I also spoke to Hansi Flick, whom I've known for a long time through the national team. It could have been a good fit, but in the end it fell through.

&amp;#x200B;

**What role did money play in the change?**

None!

&amp;#x200B;

**Freely according to the motto: ""Don't have to do anything for a year or two ...""**

... and still be successful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Your declared goal is to win the Champions League in the medium term.**

As an athlete, I have to set myself goals. I find the competition exciting, I would like to experience the whole process again, the emotions in the knockout phase and, if in doubt, lift the Cup.

&amp;#x200B;

**But not with PSV, right?**

Admittedly, it's not the direct route. I realise that many factors have to fit together. Let's put it this way: it's the long-term goal. But I just remember Ajax, who suddenly shook up the Champions League two years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**They are already dreaming of winning the Champions League again. Why this fixation on titles?**

When you become German champion as early as I did and then world champion soon after, you grow into that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

**But don't these goals get you down? At PSV you won't be winning any titles until further notice. That's pressure.**

But I didn't come here to play a little football, I came here to get back on top. Everyone here is working to make it a success as quickly as possible, even if success doesn't always happen overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

**But you are also concerned with winning back the joy of football.**

Of course that was the focus of the change. But now it's not enough to just say: ""Great, I played for 90 minutes again"".

&amp;#x200B;

*""There was no performance culture that was exclusively designed for performance""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Could you get out of the two-year contract early if a top club wants you?**

We have agreed with PSV that we will sit down together if they make an exceptional offer. A lot stands and falls for me in Eindhoven with the coaching staff. If Roger wanted to leave, I would be worried. That's why our full concentration is on achieving second place in the Honours Division so that we can qualify for the Champions League.

&amp;#x200B;

**Your dream club used to be FC Barcelona.**

That hasn't changed. To celebrate possession football with this team, alongside Lionel Messi, that would be a dream. But not at any price!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is different today?**

Today, before every transfer, I would think very carefully about the people I would meet at the new club.

&amp;#x200B;

**In 2015, as a Bayern player and a newly-crowned World Champion, you said that compared to your early professional years, you feel football is more like a job and more like work. How is that now?**

It's a good mix. I want to be professional and successful, but I can also see football again more as a game that is enjoyable and that you can't be too dogged about.

&amp;#x200B;

**Have you lost the fun in between?**

Not in the game itself - I'll never lose that. But when I don't play for weeks, train hard and still have the feeling that I'm not getting a fair competition, that naturally takes the joy out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do you mean by not getting ""fair competition""?**

In the last two years at Borussia Dortmund, I don't think there was a performance culture from my my perspective that was exclusively based on performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Does that mean Lucien Favre didn't appreciate your work?**

I think that performance should be in the foreground and that this must then be reflected in assignments. Unfortunately, that was not the case under him in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

**Even though you are not the verbal type, did you express your displeasure?**

Sure. If I have to, I can express my opinion clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

**What did Favre say in reply?**

That he doesn't believe I can help the team and that he doesn't have a position for me, which basically made little sense to me and were more excuses. In the end, it's up to him to decide, even though I don't think my training performance allowed that conclusion. But the phase also made me better.

&amp;#x200B;

**You also didn't get on so well with Thomas Tuchel after returning to BVB in 2016?**

Under him, I simply wasn't in the best physical shape.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things went better with Peter Bosz.**

He had a playing philosophy that suited me and he trusted me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peter Stöger even criticised your game in front of running cameras.**

But at least he let me play, even if things didn't otherwise spark between us. You know, when I play and criticism is voiced, that's no problem. Then I have the chance to refute my critics on the pitch. But if I don't play at all, it goes in the wrong direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**In the 2019/20 season, you only made one competitive appearance over the entire season under Lucien Favre. How frustrating was that time?**

For me, the most important thing is to make the most of the years I have as an active footballer. Of course, during that time I also thought about a quick solution at times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meaning: you wanted to leave!**

When I realised in the first Favre season of 2018/19 that I wasn't even a squad member anymore. But in the second half of the season I played almost all the time and we almost became champions. In this decisive phase, I had my best phase since returning to BVB compared to my teammates. That's why I was very optimistic going into the new season. But because of the expiring contract coupled with the lack of appearances, I was already living in Dortmund at the end with the feeling that I no longer had any relevance.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you deal with a situation like that?**

The big question in such bitter phases: Is it worth it to give in to the frustration? Or should I not concentrate on what I can influence myself? If a coach doesn't appreciate what I do, I can't change it. Do I want to wear myself out on this or am I better off turning to what is good for me and my family?

&amp;#x200B;

**How much is your wife affected by these moments of frustration?**

I have to deal with a lot of things myself. I'm not the type to go completely berserk either. But, admittedly, my wife and I talk a lot about the job and she also notices when I'm down.

&amp;#x200B;

*""At some point I realised that it wasn't getting any better.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Even before that, your return to BVB in 2016 was not under a good star. In the first half of 2017, you suffered from a metabolic disorder, which was also a consequence of excessive expectations of yourself. You trained obsessively, but got worse. Were you too dogged?**

Well, that's how it was. I've always had a certain tendency to do more than others, to expect too much of myself and to want too much. It drove me to push myself to the limits. Mentally and physically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did that get out of control?**

At the beginning of my career, I had great success very quickly. When the titles came, the feeling became even more extreme. It was like: ""You only have a maximum of 15 years of career, so now give it..."". When the first injuries came, I then trained even harder and didn't understand that I couldn't keep turning the wheel. At some point my body told me.

&amp;#x200B;

**You always seemed like a professional who has a healthy distance to himself and the business. At what point did that get lost?**

It was a process. I trained more every season, after work and early in the morning. At some point I realised that it wasn't getting any better and I realised that rest is at least as important as constant training.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do you do differently now?**

For a good five years now, I make sure to really relax when I'm on holiday - and don't start training again after two days. And I try to get enough rest phases. Training control and the stress and regeneration phases are extremely important at this level - especially in English weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you actually have an explanation for the fact that your two professional seasons at BVB were so different?**

In my first seven professional years, I only had two coaches: Klopp and Pep. The teams were also mostly identical. When I came back to BVB in 2016, I had four coaches in four years and the staff changed all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

 *""Only won the cup once in four years. Quite thin!""*

&amp;#x200B;

**What do you mean?**

Such a fluctuation makes it easier neither for a player nor for the club to play consistently at a high level. It also doesn't exactly speak for the club knowing where it wants to go. In four years since 2016, we have only won the cup once with BVB. That's pretty thin.

&amp;#x200B;

**You could have switched to Liverpool FC in 2016 instead of BVB.**

I was even in England and Jürgen presented his new project to me. His work, his attitude and his successes speak for him and make him one of the best coaches in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**But?**

You have to think of it like this: Where did I come from? From Munich, where I had reached the semi-finals of the Champions League three times with Bayern. I wanted to do that again! Liverpool had finished eighth in the league. In short: In the situation at the time, the probability of winning the Champions League with Borussia in the medium term seemed much greater to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**No thought: we'll get the old band back together?**

Of course, there was also an emotional component. I thought of the great times under Jürgen at BVB and hoped to experience something similar. Especially since what Tuchel had initiated in Dortmund was developing very well at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**When you returned, you obviously didn't realise how centrally important Klopp's personnel was for BVB's championships in 2011 and '12?**

Not then, but today I do! In the meantime, I have realised how important a coach is for a team - and also for me as a player. Jürgen was and is the deciding factor at BVB and LFC.

&amp;#x200B;

**So returning to Dortmund was a mistake.**

Mistake is the wrong word. In the situation it wasn't a mistake because I made a very conscious decision against Liverpool and for Dortmund. But of course I regret the decision when you see what Jürgen has built up at Liverpool.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jürgen Klopp was the defining coach in your first professional years. When you surprisingly switched to FC Bayern in 2013, he almost had a heart attack, he told us. Why didn't you include him in your considerations back then?**

I was twenty and lacked any experience, foresight and maturity on how to handle such a thing. I decided completely on instinct, as I did on the pitch, without thinking about the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

**Even fellow players you were friends with didn't suspect anything.**

I found the project exciting and just thought as a footballer: ""Cool, you can train under Pep - and maybe win the Champions League."" Otherwise, I made it up with myself and didn't think about how the fans, colleagues and media would react.

&amp;#x200B;

**Then FC Bayern pricked the transfer through prematurely: on the day of the semi-final second leg in the Champions League against Real Madrid. Jürgen Klopp was beside himself.**

At that moment, I became more aware of what a huge topic this is.

&amp;#x200B;

**From one moment to the next, you fell out of favour with many BVB fans and were under police protection for weeks. The full programme.**

I had pulled the exit clause in my contract and had done nothing unfair. I never expected this reaction. But I had made that decision - and now I had to go through with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**And then you present yourself in Munich in the T-shirt of your sponsor ""Nike"". At the ""Adidas"" club par excellence, of all places. After that, you lost the image of the coolly calculating young professional.**

When I was 19 or 20, I played my football and didn't think much about such things. I arrived at the press conference, thought I was in Bayern territory and thought they were now dictating protocol. If they had handed me a jersey, I would have put it on. But when I was supposed to go up to the podium, the ""Nike"" representative gave me the shirt instead. I assumed it was arranged with Bayern and put it on. There were enough Bayern officials there, nobody said anything. Today I would have thought of my own accord that something was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Was the move to Munich a turning point in your dealings with the media?**

Definitely. Until then, I looked at the football business with wide eyes and went along with everything that happened. But in Munich it took on dimensions I could never have imagined. I had a lot of experiences back then that I wouldn't call mistakes today, but things that helped me move forward. Because I would never do them like that again. (Laughs.)

&amp;#x200B;

**When did you develop this detached, sometimes ironic view of your career faux pas?**

It was different three or four years ago. Today I'm more broadly positioned, I've gained many new perspectives and I'm increasingly concerned with things outside sport. And with the birth of my son, I can also laugh about what happened to me.",borussiadortmund,translated 11Freunde interview with Gotze,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/n59cyh/translated_11freunde_interview_with_gotze/,2021-05-05 14:35:04

InexorableWyrd,1624729918.0,o8flsm,31.0,1.0,"At this point many if not all of you already know this, but I figured I write it down anyway. 

Marco Rose is another Ex-Mainz coach with a penchant for pressing and attacking and was once described by Kloppo as the “most hyped manager”. His coaching pedigree boasts Wolfgang Frank, Klopp and the Red Bull Corporation. His style of play is attractive and I don’t want to detail it here (but if you want to read about it try [this]( https://totalfootballanalysis.com/competitions/bundesliga/marco-rose-borussia-monchengladbach-2020-21-tactical-analysis-tactics) or [this]( https://onenil.medium.com/analyzing-marco-roses-monchengladbach-discovery-of-yet-another-german-jewel-bbba2dd33dee)) but I will make some key summary observations for this post.

1.	Rose prefers playing either a 4-3-1-2 or a 4-2-3-1
2.	His teams press carefully high and hard BUT in a smart compact way that cuts off any passing lane. 
3.	His teams play centrally, preferring central overload rather than wing overload. Even his 4-2-3-1 morphs into 4-3-1-2 with one of the wingers playing centrally as a 10 while the other cuts inside to accompany the striker. The wing backs press high to give width if needed.
4.	Attacking fluidity between the front three. Everyone should be able to play each position.
5.	The GKs MUST be exceptional with their feet. Sommer had the 4th highest xG Build Up across all GKs in the top 5 leagues
6.	Player overload in play buildup. Usually, the CDM drops between the CBs or just ahead to help with buildup.
7.	Defensively, (in a Favre like fashion) its either a 4-4-1-1 or a 4-4-2 formation. But unlike Favre its not a low block due to the requisite pressing involved. However, his teams try and push the opponent to the wings and wingbacks try and stay compact with the CBs but this can lead to exploitation on the counter when the wingbacks sit too tight.



**The 4-3-1-2 Formation**

A formation Rose employed in his Salzburg teams with a wingbacks providing the width with a strong passing 6 in front of ball playing CBs who have the pace to cover if needed. Alongside the 6 sit two box-to-box midfielders contributing to the attack and defense. Then you have a strong playmaker/finisher as a 10. Up top you have a strong Striker that holds the ball and another faster, agile, playmaker striker that makes the required runs and passes or finishes the chances. An example of how that looks can be shown in this [passing map]( https://www.esdfanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG-20171204-WA0000-683x1024.jpg) with Minamino starting at the 8 alongside Haidara with Schlager shielding and Berisha playing CAM. So how will this fit us?
IMO, this complements our lack of wingers quite nicely. Our best team here would look something like [this](https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/60d75f4cd998900ebe437ae1). Keep in mind this is not taking into account any incoming transfers (I’ll get too that).


**The 4-2-3-1 Formation**

Everyone knows this [formation]( https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/60d760e3d998900ebe437ae3). Not the strongest because of the addition of Reyna (no knock against him, he is an excellent player, but still too young and not a winger), Sancho of course would have made this formation shine like he did end of last season. This formation has its pros and its cons. In terms of pros there is attacking versatility. You can attack from the wings or centrally. You employ different ideas as well. However, it does remove another person from midfield where stronger possession-based teams can take advantage (and have).


**Rumored Transfers**

So far, we have been linked with Donyell Malen and Noni Madueke from PSV and St. Juste from Mainz. I think these transfers make remarkable sense if we play these formations. 
Malen is a fast, agile, smart striker who can play the wings but is more of a second striker in a two-striker system. He makes good decisions and likes to involve his teammates as can be seen from the Euros. Madueke used to be a CAM/ST that transitioned to playing on the right wing because he could cut in to his preferred foot using his blistering pace. You can already start seeing how they fit in. In a 4-3-1-2, Malen fits in like a glove right next to Haaland. He can make the runs, play one-twos with Reus and Haaland, and he can stretch the defense. It takes no imagination that he can play the Thuram role as well in the 4-2-3-1 with Thuram basically using his power and pace to cut in and play as the second striker. Reus will be the key here. Reus as the hardworking/playmaking/finishing 10 can connect both strikers and turn the formation on a whim to a three striker formation or a midfield heavy one. 

Madueke, on the other hand gives us what we have been wanting since Hakimi left: Pace. Haaland is pacy and Sancho could sprint, but you need someone to create space on the wings and bring others into the game. In a 4-2-3-1, Madueke could be the answer. Plus with his history of playing CAM or ST he can fit into formation where a 4-2-3-1 can transition into 4-3-1-2 with Noni cutting inside and the CAM (likely Hazard or Reus) going up top with Haaland. 

St. Juste will fit into backing up Akanji. The reason I see this as linked target is because we need someone to cover when a striker gets behind defense. IMO, every phase of play should have at least one pacy individual. Akanji is fast but St. Juste was the fastest player last season in the Bundesliga. Plus Zagadou injured and playing the LCB we do need another RCB to back up Akanji which frees Can to play either as a 6 when Witsel is out or as a Box to Box 8 which also makes a ton of sense.
The formations would like something like [this](https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/60d765d6d998900ebe437ae5) and [this](https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/60d7664dd998900ebe437ae6). 

In conclusion, I think the rumored transfers could possible fit in very well with the formations Rose can play and I’m excited to see what Rose can bring to the table to the Pokalseigers.",borussiadortmund,Marco Rose’s Preferred Formations and How Our Squad Fits and the Rumored Transfers,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/o8flsm/marco_roses_preferred_formations_and_how_our/,2021-06-27 01:51:58

Watch as neutrals and those looking for the Beautiful Game

These players whose names we know or at least recognize are held high in our standards

Their expectations we may never know for ourselves

They are larger than life, heroes pitched against one another 90 minutes at a time

Indeed, our heroes are mortals

Men and women, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, friends, countrymen, and lovers…

In the end they are much like us

To see a man stricken as such fuels my own concerns

I think to the man's family as they must be feeling so much more

Winning or losing, the highs and lows of ultimately a game now mean so much more

Whether you pray or you don’t, our thoughts became something higher and we wanted a man to live, against any odds

My thoughts shall remain with the family and friends of Christian Eriksen

If I could I would lend my strength to them, for they might overcome doubt and fear of an unknown life that was once so certain

Strength to friends and family and to the staff of stadiums and hospitals who hold so much together under our very noses

All the best to Christian Eriksen, for the strength necessary to show us again the game in which you play so beautifully

Or at the very least, the strength necessary to live a beautiful life

Fanclubs in your area? 

Summerbreak is here, so I would like to bring to your attention a project of mine.  When I moved to Norway, it took me about 6 years to find out that there was a national BVB fanclub in Norway.  To help other BVB supporters find also a group or likeminded people or even a fanclub, I created my BVB #Worldmap.  
The idea is to collect BVB related locations on the map and hopefully connect some BVB Fans. You can find here:

* **BVB** Fanclubs (Official and not official ones)
* Pubs &amp; Bars where you can see **BVB** matches
* Match overview and where the matches are played
* and if you visit **Dortmund**, I have added locations around the city / stadium that may help you as well. 

You can find the map here: [https://maphub.net/nicovadoy/bvb\_worldmap](https://maphub.net/nicovadoy/bvb_worldmap)

  
And here my question to you. Do you know of...

* ...any **BVB** fanclub in your area, that is not on the map yet?
* ...any pub / bar that shows Bundesliga / **BVB** matches from time to time?

If you do, please comment below or send me a message via FB Messenger (no Friend request required), and I will update the map with the new information.

This may not be the end of it all though as both Essen and Bergisch Gladbach (who will be relegated after losing to us) are filing a lawsuit raising doubts over our inability to play the matches on the prior dates due to not having enough players. They claim we listed 28 players for the 2nd team and then shorty before the matches in doubt, the list was down to 22 players with Knauff, Tigges and Passlack missing as well. This put us below the minimum requirement after positive Covid cases so the matches were postponed. Essen and Gladbach now claim this was done on purpose to save energy and wait for players to heal up in order to gain an unfair advantage. You can read about it here in German:

crackbit,1627574195.0,ou086s,11.0,1.0,"I did a rough translation of Aki Watzke's [interview](https://youtu.be/lNke2h4QPYA) in our pre-season training camp for anyone interested.

* On the new coach: It’s difficult. After 17 training camps, I can’t remember one where after 4 weeks half of the team is not there yet. I liked seeing Rose’s training, his concept and how he addresses the team. We will do what’s possible in this training camp, but it’s different.
* On center-backs: Everything you do, you need to do within reason. Mats will come back quicker than what is speculated in the media, that’s what I can settle on. Emre is also back. And in September, two center-backs will come back \[Zagadou and Coulibaly?\]. If we, in September, have 4-5 center backs, and we will now get another one, then who should play? When we knew that one of our main center backs will be out until Christmas, then I’d agree with you. But the current situation is that it’s not urgent. If we have to take action, we would, but it has to make sense and we have to think for longer periods than just two weeks. 
* On other incoming transfers after Sancho’s departure: We didn’t get any money yet, it will come in instalments. Basically, we are financially strong enough to do one thing or another without selling. On the other hand, we are blind about how the future will be. It’s good to have reserves if things don’t improve and we can only have a couple of thousand fans in the stadium. If that keeps on going for a while, then a lot of football clubs will be in great trouble, not just what we are facing now already. It helps to be careful in that case. I have the feeling that we have a good team. The center-back situation is difficult currently, but saying that we need to act on the transfer market is still too abstract at the moment. If something is possible and we see a good opportunity on the market, Zorc and Kehl will definitely take action after consulting with Rose.
* On the the Robert-Koch Institut stating that [incidences should be the main basis for decision-making in the pandemic](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/coronavirus-spahn-wieler-inzidenzwert-1.5367040): I can’t understand that to be honest. I agree with RKI that more people could be vaccinated by now. I’m looking at Corona numbers every morning now and I could tell you how many cases there are in other countries. It was the main strategy to vaccinate people, and after enough people are vaccinated, the incidences are not as important as the number of hospitalisations. In the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, even if there incidences are over 35 per 100.000 we are allowed to have 22.000 visitors in our stadium. Of course, the majority has to be vaccinated. People have to be rewarded if they are vaccinated and allowed to go on a concert or in the stadium. I’m not a supporter of mandatory vaccinations, perhaps for some professions, but not for everyone. It’s an individual choice, but we as hosts have also the domestic authority of defining who can come. Only 1% of people being infected at the moment have had both shots. I can only make a call that, if it’s medically possible, to get yourself vaccinated. For football, it’s really important to have an audience again.
* On the possibility of taking legal action: Suing can only be the last resort. All in all, the government \[die Politik\] did a good job. Germany got through Corona quite well, but with huge costs. We can’t discern yet how much debt the country had to take on. I always like to find solutions together with the government \[die Politik\] instead of taking legal actions. The solution for me is looking at hospitalisations. It’s also a difference if somebody is just tested or vaccinated. But we need to also think of children \[who cannot be vaccinated yet\] and need an allotment for tested children \[enabling them to come to the stadium\]. It’s a difficult topic.
* On the importance of having an audience in the stadium: For this season, we plan with a 60% average capacity. But even then, we will not produce a profit. If we need to play 2-3 years with 40-50% capacity, then we would have a big problem. It also depends on the situation in other countries. If other countries can play with 100%, then we obviously can’t compete anymore. I’m interested to see how it develops.
* On other clubs who can make purchases as if Corona didn’t happen, specifically PSG: There are not that many clubs. The divide \[between wealthy clubs and others\] will increase anyway, that’s out of the question. In Paris, they worked a lot with free transfers. They can of course afford to pay the appropriate salary. Donnarumma, Sergio Ramos were free transfers. In all in all, clubs are still reserved because of the pandemic. But, of course, if you’re a club that is possibly owned by a state, you have different possibilities than when you’re dependent on your income stream like BVB. For a club like Borussia Dortmund and other Bundesliga clubs, who are dependent on generating income, that’s a difficult phase, that’s totally clear.
* On the gap between Dortmund and Bayern: I think it stayed the same. Bayern has the same situation as we do. \[What about the fact that they lost Alaba and Boateng?\] Sorry, but we lost Jadon and Pisczu. We are even. \[But Piszczcek…\] Piszczek was a dominant player for us, especially in the last 3 months. 
* On how this affects the goals for this season: We should not get too cocky \[übermütig\]. Last season, we didn’t give any goal and that was a good decision. We want to improve in the Bundesliga and get as far as we can in the DFB Pokal and Champions League. That answer may not satisfy you, but it’s the reality.
* On not having allowed enough players to join the German Olympic team: Looking at the last three weeks, we couldn’t have given away any more players. We can’t do anything about the timing of the Olympics. I’m responsible for Borussia Dortmund and we already have a situation to manage with not having enough players. We just couldn’t do more. In the past, the Olympics were also meant for amateur players. We can’t both have Euro 2020 and Olympics and let the clubs pay for it.
* On Julian Brandt staying at BVB: For me it’s been clear the whole time, just like with Erling Haaland staying. I’m repeating myself over and over, but nobody is interested and I’m reading something else week in week out. We planned with Julian from the beginning and we all hope he has a good year, in which he can exploit his potential. He’s a good guy and I also like him personally.

I was sitting in a Biergaten with friends in Munich in 2019 and saw Mats sitting on the table behind me. I did not go to him immediately, coz in Germany people are relaxed with celebrities around, in order to give them the space to live a normal life. The entire evening I was waiting for the right chance to go and say hi.

Finally I went up to him, congratulated him on his World Cup, and shared a couple of my memories from his time at BVB. I asked him how was it to work under Klopp. (Klopp, obviously is one of my favourite people in the world).

He said, Klopp made him the man he is. He gave him his opportunity at BVB.

After a few more kind words, I asked him for a selfie. I'm a man with small arms, so my selfie game is not the best. Mats took my phone from me and took the selfie himself.

I thanked him and said good night.

Mats is a decent man. He may have gone to Bayern in unfortunate circumstances, but he is back and he did give BVB fans wonderful memories, esp the Double season in 2012.

I hope you guys enjoyed my short story. YNWA

Geeman447,1625795107.0,oglgpc,47.0,1.0,"Signings

Donyell Malen: I think this is one of those forgone conclusion signings. Seems like he wants us and we have everything set besides the price. A couple days after Sancho is officially sold I’m sure we get him. He’s rapid (which our club severely lacks), great running with the ball, good vision for a striker as well, and he’s a striker which we haven’t had multiple good strikers at Dortmund in awhile. 
Price: 27-35 mil

Leon Bailey: I personally believe he’s the best winger for us. Noni is flashy but unproven and English. I just don’t want more English players. They will always leave if they play well don’t see the point in bringing them in unless it’s a luxury situation. Diaby I believe just is too expensive. Bailey is rapid (^ to what I said earlier) and skillful. He has amazing shot power and isn’t afraid to let them rip which we’ve struggled with for awhile now. So many times do we just pass it around and as fans we sit there screaming “just shooooot”. Personally out of all the names he’s my ideal one. But I’m not set in stone and willing to go with someone else for the same price. 
Price: 20-27 mil

Marcel Sabitzer: I’ll preference this with saying, yes I know we’re deep centrally. With Delaney looking more and more likely that he will move the the prem (not sure why we’re willing to sell him) signing marcel is perfect. We have 6s in Can and Witsel 8s are Dahoud, Bellingham, and maybe Brandt. Sabitzer for the price of 20 mil (rumored, max 30 is what I’d spend). He’s in his prime, he isn’t a player who’d join and leave he would be here for at least a 5 year contract. His vision and willingness to play the pass is amazing. He has an amazing pot shot. Pace and a dog mentality. Adding prime aged players and leaders is never a bad thing. I would LOVE this signing. 
Price: 20-30mil

Marcel Halstenburg: This signing for me is meh in my book but only completed if Nico is sold. He’s solid because he is a defensive minded LB who also is versatile and plays that LCB which is ideal since I believe we will flirt with a 3ATB at some point this year. 
Price: Max 10 mil and that is a bit much. 

Kevin Mbabu: This isn’t going to happen at all. We seem set with Thomas at RB but more pace in the back with just being a freak athlete who is skilled would be very good for us. Maybe in the winter or next year if Thomas doesn’t pan out. 

For signings I think is is the max amount of players we will sign. I don’t see more than 3-4 players. 

Departures

Roman Burki: He’s run his course here in a BVB kit. He was amazing for the first bit and at the end of last season to all this season wasn’t up to par. Crazy potential to amazing games but is highly consistent. Which as a GK the primary trait you want is consistency. Not proud of how he’s being dealt with but it’s the right decision. Also we need him to pay the transfer of Kobel. 

Nico Schulz: In fairness to him he played much better this year that prior. But with his wages he’s a must let go. I don’t really have a problem with him just doesn’t fit well. 

Reinier Jesus Carvalho: I don’t mine the idea of loans but this doesn’t benefit us in any way. Send him back to Madrid and let them develop their own players. He doesn’t play and when he does I’d rather that time go to our boys. 

Thomas Delaney: Personally I love him. He’s a stud and a rock. Dude gives 110% always. Purely a depth and get the most out of him sale. If he wants a prem move like he did before coming to us doing it now will give us a good profit especially since he was spectacular in the euros.

I still have the feeling that unless we sell Sancho, not a lot is going to happen this transfer window. There are rumors about Bürki leaving for Monacco but thats about it.

However, it's fair to say that he didn't have a great first season at Dortmund. I remember him doing very well against Mainz in January, a game in which he scored, but after that his form dropped off.

What I don't really seem to know about him though is what kind of player he actually is. I never saw very much of him at PSG, and still don't feel like I've seen much of him for Dortmund.

What are his strengths, weaknesses, and habits? What's his favourite position and role? Is there a tactical reason for his poor start at BVB? How might Rose look to use him? How does he compare to other RBs that Rose has favoured in the past?

It seems like this club is known for making good financial decisions and will not be bullied in the transfer market. Can someone please elaborate on the management style and the financials. I know that people online have said that they like to develop players and sell them for a profit. Is that true? 

And to relate all this to the actual game, will they ever be able to be one of the best clubs in the world if they sell all their good players. For example, Haaland will be sold next year, I have read.

Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool have been always my favourite 2 clubs so I decided to to buy a ticket for the Hoffenheim match and went alone to the match. I've never been to dortmund before and this is actually my second match ever that I attend in a stadium. I was afraid that it would be boring going alone but boy oh boy how glad I was wrong.

I was seated in Block 53 and next to me sat 2 German guys, I don't speak German at all but I was trying to learn and repeat what the fans were singing and chanting. When the fans started singing YNWA one of the 2 guys looked at me and I understood immediately that I have to stand with them holding my BVB scarf high and waving right and left, I had goosebumps , the feeling was amazing. but the icing on the cake was when Haaland scored the 3rd goal and the whole stadium went crazy , I was screaming they were screaming , they hugged me and we started jumping and shouting, It was like a dream, I even kicked on of the guys beer by mistake when I was jumping, he didn't care, we just won the match, everyone was ecstatic. 

So with this post I just want to send my thanks to these 2 guys sat at block 53 row 13 seats 51 and 50. you guys made my day and this night is in my life top 3 memories thanks to you. I felt like we are all BVB family no matter what language we speak and I'm sorry again I spilled your beer, hopefully I can buy you another one if we ever meat again :)",borussiadortmund,BVB fans are the best! here is why &lt;3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/pdgexy/bvb_fans_are_the_best_here_is_why_3/,2021-08-29 03:39:55

Swanki24,1629931737.0,pbmgsw,34.0,1.0,"And we're also in moderate danger of dropping down to pot 3 next year in certain cases such as teams with lower club coefficients winning the UCL/UEL like last year, which push teams with really high CC into pot 2 when we're barely hanging onto pot 2.

[These are how the pots look like this year in the CL](https://imgur.com/Dq65d0B) and we barely managed to slide into pot 2 by having 3 more points than Porto.

[This is how the current rankings of the club coefficient look like.](https://imgur.com/dREe7O0) Our disastrous 17/18 points will still play a role for next season's coefficient calculation and if we don't perform well enough in Europe this year there's a good chance of us being pushed down to pot 3, which gives us a higher chance to face two big clubs in the group stage instead of the usual one or even NONE like last year when we got super lucky. Pot 3 also means there's a higher chance that we fail to qualify for CL knockout rounds, though CC points can still be salvaged by making deep EL runs if we finish 3rd in group.

Tottenham and Roma are already higher than us in rankings and if they manage a deep run in the ECL and qualify for CL next year (more likely for Roma than Tottenham imo) there's an even higher chance of us dropping down to pot 3. 

Well, good news is that at least I don't see us being really caught up by teams below us in the CC rankings unless we seriously fuck up this year in Europe. Our 17/18 points expire from 22-23 season onwards, so it's pivotal that we see at least decent results, so we can see us go up in CC rankings and maintain our pot 2 status.

Moving onto possible draws for the CL, I'd be happy as long as we avoid City and Chelsea from pot 1, and Zenit from pot 3 since I don't want the team to travel so far for the away game. Other teams seem either manageable or could give us a fun challenge to look forward to.

Agar11,1629596341.0,p93mv1,11.0,5.0,"I think we should either invest in a proper 6 or stop playing Gio in that 8 role. Dahoud acting as our lone 6 and him basically being the only cover our CBs receive (since Schulz/Passlack and our other 3 midfielders are always farther up the pitch as well) leaves us way too exposed and Dahoud is just decent at best defensively which leads him to commit unnecessary tackles whenever we get countered. 
This should be our midfield from now on imo: 
Dahoud
Bellingham Delaney
Reus

Not really a big fan of the diamond formation (I prefer the 4-2-3-1 by far) but it is what it is I guess.

I expect this to be the usual tough game. Away games in Freiburg are rarely fun or.. easy.
At least we have the honor to be part of the last Bundesliga game that will be played in the Dreisamstadion(Schwarzwald- stadion). They will move to the new stadium with the next home game.

This is part one, where the history and the background are covered up to 2013. I'm thinking that some of this can be tightened up and/or cut out, but I'm not sure what, or where.

I'm also looking for more input on style changes to fit a more direct question/answer format, as I (and we) have grown beyond the injokes and things like that. Also, I am trying to remove the ""we"" and put BVB in it's place. Help?

Part II is forthcoming; I'm so stuck on the Bosz era it's ridiculous. I don't even know where to begin and end on that.

*New Fans' Guide To BVB

Version 8.0; by /u/FivesCeleryStalk and formerly /u/romantuerki*

#NOTES

**Please remember that this is VASTLY abbreviated and so what one thinks is important vs what I think or you think is important, may or may not be covered.** This is just a quick-and-dirty introduction to Borussia Dortmund for the new fans. This guide is geared towards non-German/English speakers.

*Remember:* ""Dortmund"" here refers to the city, ""BVB"" refers to the club. First-person plural pronouns will also be used to refer to BVB and the supporters.

#Basics

**Who, or what, is Borussia Dortmund (BVB)?**

The reason this subreddit exists.

Borussia Dortmund (BVB), is a sports club based in Dortmund, Germany, that plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of football (soccer) in Germany. There are also divisions for table tennis, womens' handball, and as of this year (2021), a womens' football team, but they aren't as well-known or prominent as the main football division.

**What is its history?**

""Ballspielverein Borussia Dortmund"" was founded in a pub on Borsigplatz on 19 December 1909. The name ""Borussia"" came from a (now, long gone) brewery of the same name - though in Latin, ""Borussia"" means ""Prussia/Prussian"", it was the brewery/beer rather than the state of Prussia that inspired the name.

Dortmund has a mythos all it's own; it's the ""working class club"", and after 2005, ""the underdog"". People often say that the club doesn't have the mythos or the allure that clubs like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich do, but they could not be any more wrong - BVB may not have the flash, but Dortmund has the history, the fans, and most importantly, the accessibility.

BVB have, before and since the inception of the Bundesliga, won 8 domestic titles, and are second on the eternal Bundesliga table.

**Why is 1997 so important?**

May 28, 1997 was the day that put BVB firmly on the world stage. During the '90's BVB was a pretty successful club, as BVBwon the BL title back to back in '95 and '96, but Serie A (Italy) was the dominant soccer (football) league at the time.

Lars Ricken scored his record-setting goal during the Champions League final, and BVB went on to beat Juventus to claim the Champions League trophy. This is important: BVB, versus one of the ""shining stars"" of Europe - Juventus - and beating them. Juventus was the clear favorite and BVB stunned the world. BVB also won the Intercontinental Cup against Cruzeiro in December '97 (think the UEFA Supercup, but with CL winners vs. Copa Libertadores winners.)

**What happened in 2000-2005?**

Though Matthias Sammer led BVB to a Bundesliga title in 2002, BVB was plagued by financial mismanagement. Overspending on players and wages, and the tanking of its shares on the German stock exchange, meant that BVB came extraordinarily close to becoming insolvent in 2004/5.

/u/Vio0 explains it in this comment thread:

Well, Watzke became our CEO in February 2005 after joining the club in 2001(?). We already sold everything and didn't really have any options left, and our creditors knew. This was also the time when Bayern gave us a 2m loan(!) to pay our players. It really didn't change much considering our debts were above €180m(?). Watzke presented his/their restructuring plans, our creditors gave us some more time and delayed the payments until 2006 or 2007 iirc. They could have easily pulled the plug at any given moment. The league gave us strict obligations for us to get a license for the coming season. Watzke told in an interview that it was about trust, because he obviously couldn't assure anything. The rest is history.

So, they won titles in 2010/11 and 2011/12? What's the big deal?

This meant that BVB got a spot in the Champions League in 2011/2012. BVB is ascending to international football once again, after near catastrophe.

2011 saw BVB equalise with Sch*lke for number of league wins (it needs to be pointed out that they have NEVER won a title since the inception of the Bundesliga). This is important, not to mention incredibly gratifying.

BVB set a then-record for most points earned in the Bundesliga with 81.

BVB beat Bayern Munich for the DFB-Pokal trophy.

You may notice that many players who were at BVB before the CL final in May '13 are much loved and admired. That is because BVB was not expected to be contenders. The financial problems that the club suffered meant that the team couldn't draw from a wider talent pool, so they were below average in player wages and ages. They were truly homegrown talent. The ascendancy of the BVB star was truly unexpected as well - within six years, BVB went from being nearly bankrupt club to legitimate contenders on the European stage. And that is no small feat.

--

From here is 2013 and that's going to be included in the next draft. I'm doing this in parts so it's not overwhelming. Plus, I'm not exactly sure how to treat 2013 yet; I feel like it needs a larger part where the above can be condensed and tightened.

First game of the season! Here we are! I expect us not to start Can and Malen because one recently returned from Injury and the other one still needs to get adapted to the way we are playing. I however 100% expect Malen to get subbed in in the second half.

Standard kicktipp rules apply: guessing the correct result (win/loss or tie) gives you two points, the correct goal difference (except for ties) gives you an extra point, and the correct scoreline would bring you a grand total of four points per fixture.

Bonus questions include predicting the Bundesliga champions, the Hinrunde (first half of the season) champions, the team with the most proficient goal scorer, the first team to change their manager, and the teams that finish 16-18 - you can't vote for Sch***e this time :(

So I put myself together and said ""Wow! Well done that is correct"". She got so Happy! ""I can't believe it! I don't even know where it came from, I just new the name!!""

This is it. The 2021/2022 Season is OFFICIALLY starting. We face off against 3rd tier team SV Wehen Wiesbaden who so far have played two games in the 3rd tier this season, both were 0:0 games so their defense is very solid, their attack might be lacking firepower.

We on the other hand have a lot of injured/sick players AND at the same time, a lot of players that haven't had a lot of pre season so far. Therefore I think we won't see Akanji, Witsel, Delaney, Bellingham and Hazard starting.

With out defensive problems, we will probably see a lot of faces starting that won't start during the later stages of the season or that won't even make the squad as they are mainly planned for other bvb teams.
