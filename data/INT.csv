There's was a sequence against Inter (which I'm rewatching because- wiild comeback) at the 36' mark where first Eriksen tried running past him, slide tackle to disposes. Barella picks up the ball, tries the same thing, slide tackle to disposes him. Inter get the ball back, thread it to Lukaku who turns and runs at the defense (scary sight), he just stands tall, unfazed, and robs him of the ball. 

He's tall, strong, fast, good with the ball at his feet, can play either the back three or the back four, and he's still quite young. 40m for him would be an absolute steal. Infact, much as I love Skri, selling him and getting Milenkovic would be an upgrade. Not kidding.

# First the foreigners, now the 5 changes: the latest controversy about Inter goes beyond embarrassment

**The depth of the Inter roster, an element always considered a boast for other teams, now seems to become an undue advantage.**

&amp;#x200B;

In a direct dialectical translation, one would say (approx.) ""you no longer know what to criticise"" (""non sai pi√π a cosa attaccarti""). The level of controversy in Italian football has really gone down, too low even for those who are used to it.

For those who are used to years and years of artfully made polemics about first Mancini's Inter first and then Mourinho's. Polemics that have been recently commented with annoyance even by a calm person like Esteban Cambiasso.

""There was one thing that was brought out in every competition. Who cares if a player like Stankovic is Italian or not? What matters is his interism, and a player like him attached to the jersey is a very rare commodity. I confess that the criticism of Inter being too ""foreign"" disturbed me"", said Cambiasso in a very candid way in the interview with Paolo Cond√≤ for the book ""La storia dell'Inter in 50 ritratti"".

&amp;#x200B;

ITALIANS IN THE SQUAD ARE NO LONGER OF INTEREST

Since Beppe Marotta arrived, the Italians have multiplied at Inter, but the argument so dear to Arrigo Sacchi, on TV, was no longer pulling. And so the Atalanta, Gasperini's dreamteam, practically a multinational company, has never seen the results obtained ""hindering the growth of the National team"".

We thought that the sterile controversy about foreigners had hit rock bottom (to say nothing of the one about capital gains on young people, an exercise to be condemned to alternate plaques). Instead, in the last few hours we have started digging.

&amp;#x200B;

THE UNDUE ADVANTAGE

And so we end up with an Inter that wins thanks to the entries from Sensi, Hakimi, Vidal, Nainggolan and Sanchez. So what? So you can't. The ""it's not fair"" rule, it benefits the big teams ( what a discovery) and distorts football.

Too bad that the above rule has been introduced and confirmed at national and international level by all the federations, Premier League excluded. It will be so in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Europa League and Champions League. It has been so for months and months now.

But all of a sudden its today the problem arises, it arises for that ""double team that Inter can field"".

""Conte has the strongest squad, these 5 changes distort football, you can practically change half the team,"" said a journalist this morning, ***a well-known fan of the team that came first last year.***

And so the squad depth of Professor Sarri, now Master Pirlo's alternatives become an undue advantage if used by that crying Conte. A sterile controversy that exceeds the embarrassment level of the sports bar. A European rule, which was fine until Esposito and Agoume were the subs at Inter. With Vidal and Hakimi, apparently less so. Inter should get used to it \[media criticism\], the situation will only get worse.",FCInterMilan,"First the foreigners, now the 5 changes: the latest media controversy about Inter goes beyond embarrassment",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/j19tqh/first_the_foreigners_now_the_5_changes_the_latest/,2020-09-28 18:52:29
meisteroland,1601289338.0,j19msp,9.0,1.0,"After the last season I think it was obvious that he is out of his prime, and I was thinking that Marotta would have bought a new goalkeeper like Musso or Cragno (I'm still hoping for a swap between Radja and Cragno). But it doesn't seem the case. 
Even vs the fiorentina the chiesa goal was ridiculous, the shot and accuracy wasn't even good and they score anyway, Handa isn't not the player we used to know. But here in Italy the news praise him like he is still good. I know it's difficult nowadays buy a good goalkeeper, 70 million or more for a world class goalkeeper it's impossible for us, so... 

What's your opinion?

1) we need to buy a new goalkeeper before the 5th of October

# Serie A Edition:

We'll be giving away 2 personalized Inter Jerseys: one at the end of each round-robin (after our 19th and 38th matches) to whoever gets the most points (2 unique winners in total). We'll publish the rankings after each match.

The [poll for our first match](https://forms.gle/wM8B6iqqS7b5KEn77) against Fiorentina is out, so make sure to start ramping up those numbers.

# CL and Coppa Italia Edition:

There will be separate rankings for each, but the prizes will be decided on how far we go in those competitions. Otherwise, it'll be just a month of Reddit Premium to one winner per competition.

The polls close at kickoff time. Questions? Let us know in the comments.

Thanks and Forza Inter!

ArminbanVuuren,1601047061.0,izlbxc,20.0,1.0,"Between Icardi and Skiniar, it's looking this club can't manage it's big ticket items. Make all the small wins you want in the transfer market, but when you can't keep shit behind closed doors and air your dirty laundry (be it personal issues or viability in the starting XI), you're just destroying value.

Look at Spurs - Ndombele has been a lazy bust, so far. And they haven't dropped his price a nickel. But Skriniar, since we doesn't fit into a system that ~20% of teams in the world run, has dropped from being an ‚Ç¨80M talent to supposedly a ‚Ç¨45M talent. Because our board is incapable of not letting all our business go public.

**Marotta**:

We thank medics and health workers who helped us in making dealing with this pandemic less difficult. We applaud them, this pandemic left some serious marks. This Season is an anomaly, it's starting shortly after the end of the previous one. I thank the players and the staff, there's been lots of effort and sweat in this difficult situation. Football can be what brings lightheartedness to a difficult period.

**Conte**:

We finished after everyone else, we worked well. I'm happy about the attitude of the players who made themselves available. We're ready to begin once again. Like Marotta said, it's a difficult season. We're going to have to confirm the credibility we earned last year, both at a national and international level since we just competed for an international trophy.

**Marotta**:

The transfer market ends on October 5th, it'll be up to me and management to assemble the best team possible while taking economical balance into account. This pandemic brought lots of suffering and huge problems in football, every club has been trying to stay sustainable. We need to pay special attention to managing costs and earnings. We have talks and disputes going with broadcasters for their payments, and there are no earnings from fans attending games. No one is exempt from this, we're going to have to pay attention. We'll try to do what's possible and take advantage of situations if they arise, but there won't be huge investments or big operations. This is true for every club.

**Conte**:

We got experienced players in Vidal and Hakimi. Hakimi is young but he already started an important career. I completely agree with the club, we picked a strategy everyone agrees with, even taking into consideration every club's situation. We're working in total serenity and completely in sync, knowing we're going to have to confirm what we did last year, this credibility we earned by getting 82 points and good results. There's a strategy approved by everyone.

Honestly, I wouldn't talk about misunderstandings between us. I'd talk about discussions, there were opinions, at times different. But I think in every good family it's only right for everyone to express their own opinions, right or wrong. We always had very honest talks with whoever works with the club. On my part there's lots of calm and a strong desire to continue what I know I can do best, which is to work with the players. We are ready.

Everyone agrees in wanting to make ourselves better in every regard, and I'm very happy about this. We all have the objective to do what's good for Inter. We're all going to stay together, challenging the problems we may face but knowing we have to do what's best for Inter.

Eriksen? Every player is an added value. From Eriksen to Lorenzo Pirola, who is the youngest. Everyone can give more value. And I'm very happy to have this sort of players, who are also great lads. I'll repeat: all our players are ready, from Handanovic to Pirola.

Vidal? Arturo's doing well, he's already in good physical condition. Tactically we're doing new things compared to the past with me. He's fitting in well, tactically, he's a smart player. He can do everything, a Central Midfielder, Trequartista...

**Marotta**:

Last year an amazing work was done and big part of it was thanks to Antonio Conte. But we were sure that's how it'd go. He has many positive sides and a strong work ethic. And this can't be anything but rewarding. I agree with him: we all want to do what's best for Inter and to better ourselves. Last week Conte evaluated the pitch quality in the Pinetina, this is what means to love what you do as work.

Inter's objectives? We have to guarantee sustainability, which means getting into the Champions League, and then challenging properly every competition we're in.

Conte:

Last year I said there was a 1% chance for winning? It's always hard to predict what will happen. And I was right, since in the end we got really close to winning something. My feelings were correct, my choice to be part of this project was right. In the end only one team wins, but that shouldn't overshadow what we've achieved. Many times I am too harsh on myself, and I end up forgetting to enjoy what we've achieved in the process.

Sometimes it's just a matter of luck: I think back on Lukaku's miss in the EL Final, and then the own goal. No one is guaranteed to win, but we have to be guaranteed to at least be protagonists in what we do. We have to do our best and to enjoy this journey, without having regrets.

**Marotta**:

We had strong confrontations, but those are part of the dynamics in football. We're used to them. We immediately cleared everything up, and I'd be surprised to find a different Antonio Conte this year: I respect him for that, and for what he achieved. There will be tense moments and confrontations, but that's part of the game too. We need to give our best to stay competitive.",FCInterMilan,Conte and Marotta's Press Conference for the 2020/2021 Season,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/izit1c/conte_and_marottas_press_conference_for_the/,2020-09-25 20:47:56

**GK:**

* **Handanovic**
* *Radu*
* Padelli

**Defenders:**

* **De Vrij**
* **Bastoni**
* **Skriniar** (probably replaced with Milenkovic)
* *Kolarov*
* *D'Ambrosio*
* *Ranocchia* (probably leave)

Left Wings:

* **Perisic**
* *Young*
* Asamoah (probably leave)
* Dalbert (probably leave)

Right Wing:

* **Hakimi**
* *Candreva* (replaced with Darmian)

Midfielders:

* **Vidal**
* **Barella**
* **Brozovic** (probably replaced with Kante)
* *Eriksen*
* *Sensi*
* *Nainggolan* (probably leave)
* Gagliardini

* Joao Mario (probably leave)

Attackers:

* **Lukaku**
* **Martinez**
* *Sanchez*
* *Pinamonti*
* Salcedo (probably loan)
* Esposito (probably loan)

It looks to me that with GK, Midfielders and Attackers we're very good (hoping Pinamonti will suprise). 

However, I truly think we're a bit short with the 3 behind. I really like Kolarov and D'Ambrosio, I love Ranocchia as one of the best *interista* we have, but I don't think they're such a good subs to the main three. I think we should need another good sostitute, someone to rely on for turnovers or eventual injuries.

De Vrij and Bastoni are the best. Skriniar doesn't really fit to Conte's module (even replacing it with Milenkovic wouldn't be a sure bet), Kolarov won't play all matches given the age, D'Ambrosio comes out from injuries but still a good sub, Ranocchia is nice but meh.

Milan are doing good job at bringing right players lately and they even managed to make Pioli look like world class coach. 

So what a fuck are we doing, why aren't we into this guy?

He would be a perfect cover for Brozo and he can do a good job at Barella's place too. It is players like him that we need on the bench so that we do not suffer too hard in drop in quality when one of Brozo/Barella is injured or simply has a fall in form.

I know Torreira is expensive for us right now (around 20M) but quality depth in midfield is literally what killed us this season. Every time Brozo isn't at his best or is injured, we fall down for 2 levels. That's undeniable.

Were getting Vidal soon, sure. But he was never a DM and watching him at Barca he really isn't what he was before. Even tho he's still an excelent player, I think he will just bench Eriksen and will only play at Barella/Brozo position when one of them isn't around. 

IMO we need to sell some not so needed players asap and go hard for Torreira if possible.

And honestly fuck LWB, I trust in Young and he only had one bad game for us as I remember. We also got Hakimi for RWB and that should be enough for now.

owaisted,1599649896.0,ipdvxc,15.0,1.0,"All things going well, Arturo Vidal is expected to be an Inter player this week and be reunited with his former coach Antonio Conte. As per Italian daily newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, the Chilean midfielder could even be in Milan today or tomorrow to complete his move.  
 Despite 43 appearances for Barcelona last season, the 33-year-old has  been deemed numerous to the club‚Äôs plans by newly-appointed boss Ronald  Koeman.

Well, Barcelona‚Äôs loss could be Inter‚Äôs gain by far.

Vidal has little under a year left to run on his contract with Barcelona and could join the *Nerazzurri*  on a two-year deal. Barcelona may demand a minor payment from Inter  despite letting the midfielder leave for nothing, in a similar move to  when Ivan Rakitic rejoined Sevilla earlier this week.

The move didn‚Äôt just come out of the blue but has actually been long  in the pipeline. Inter have been long-term admirers of the Chilean and  even made a move for him in the winter window.

Antonio Conte seems to have gotten his man and the pair will reunite  to challenge their former side in a beautiful twist. You‚Äôre probably  thinking ‚Äì why exactly did Conte go all out for a 33-year-old?

## Vidal Is a Perfect ‚ÄúConte player‚Äù for Inter 

Arturo Vidal‚Äôs peak years are past him. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that  the midfielder is an ineffective player already. There is still a lot  left in his tank but he just needs the right manager to bring the most  out of him.

For Inter boss Antonio Conte, that will sound very familiar. The  Italian has brought the most out of the Chilean like no one else ever  has. He did that during their time together at Juventus.

Vidal was at Juve from 2011 to 2015. Playing in Conte‚Äôs trademark  3-5-2 shape, Vidal was the no-nonsense ball-winner in midfield. He found  himself playing in front of Claudio Marchisio or Andrea Pirlo and just  behind the creative force of Paul Pogba.

Playing in that area, he took the physical burdens off both Pogba and  Pirlo or Marchisio. His physical approach helped the Juve midfield work in impressive cohesion and win the Serie A in every season under Conte.  The Chilean could do the same at Inter and be in charge of the dirty work leaving Marcelo Brozovic and Christian Eriksen with more room to  flourish. It could be more beneficial for the latter player.

## A Leader In Midfield

From Nicol√≥ Barella to Marcelo Brozovic, Inter already boast a lot of  tacklers in midfield but none of them are exactly ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù Vidal is  well known to be bullish and never afraid to bark orders at players and  be vocal when needed. Being a vocal manager himself, Conte would be  watching a player with a similar attitude on the pitch. No surprise he‚Äôs  all out for him.

## Experience and Winning Mentality

More than once last season, Conte mentioned that the Inter squad were  lacking players with a proper winning attitude. Having won titles all  over Europe with Juventus, Bayern, and Barcelona, Vidal brings lots of  experience playing and winning titles at top level. It could come in  handy for the *Nerazzurri* in their quest to dethrone Juventus at the top.

Recent comments from Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti on Vidal pretty much sums up the whole transfer.

‚Äú*Vidal is a player with great character and experience, so we‚Äôll  see what happens. We are talking about a player who can certainly take  us up a level, and we are already at a good level.*‚Äù

Despite his age at 33, the Chilean still has a lot to offer Inter. Even better that he won‚Äôt cost ‚Äúmuch‚Äù as well.

This time between the Europa League final and the national team, a week in a village in Sardinia, where I knew they would swab me on arrival and departure: I'm very responsible. Few holidays, but better, so I don't lose my condition"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Did you at least celebrate your 18th birthday in July?**

""Until midnight, then the next day I had training. I celebrated with my family, that's the most important thing for me: I always thank them, they are my strength. In Lignano I was happy for my debut, but I was happier that my brother played. I am proud of us"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Did you have fun in those first 45' with the Under 21?**

""The Azzurri jersey is always a pride, which requires honours and burdens. I always try to have fun, and I must say that when we have the ball we have fun. But after the match I was angry, disappointed. Every time I made my debut in the Azzurri I scored a goal..."".

&amp;#x200B;

**But it was a friendly match.**

""There are no friendly matches on the national team"".

&amp;#x200B;

**In the Azzurri with her was her brother Salvatore. He came home, she went to Sweden to qualify for the European Championship.**

""It was a chance to see each other: we live in two different cities and it rarely happens. Then it's part of football. I stay, he doesn't. But it's not a failure for him.

&amp;#x200B;

**It was the first time of two brothers in Under 21.**

""And we are waiting for the third one, Francesco Pio, born in 2005"".

&amp;#x200B;

**In December he scored his first goal in Serie A. On a penalty kick ""given"" by Lukaku. What do you remember?**

""That I wasn't afraid! And I find it hard to believe it when I think about it. If I had to do it again now, I would be more afraid. Once on the disk, I just told myself that I could do anything but do it wrong..."".

&amp;#x200B;

**Did Lukaku say anything to you?**

""To kick safely and hard. But he had helped me before. ""Take it easy, play as you know"". Then between the first and second half I was a bit anxious and he still ""lean on me and let's go to the end, the important thing is not the goal but bringing the match home"""".

&amp;#x200B;

**Nice school, the  champions at Inter.**

""I learned a lot: from Romelu, Lautaro, Eriksen, Sanchez. Not only technical gestures but human values. My example, however, was above all D'Ambrosio: he doesn't play in my role, it's true, but he taught me respect for others, for schedules, for the group. These are fundamental things"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Will you stay at Inter?**

""I don't know, we will decide together with the club and my agent what is best. I can say that I've loved Inter since I was a child. It helped me in difficult times, it was a second family and the director of the youth sector Roberto Samaden was a second father for me. If I have to go on loan, I have to give my all and then go back to Inter. That is my goal: to play at Inter for as long as possible"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Meanwhile you're going to Sweden: tomorrow in Kalmar you play for the European qualifications.**

""It's a difficult game, because the championship started a long time ago and we haven't even started yet. But we are Italy, our team is full of values and quality. I expect a tough match"".",FCInterMilan,"Interview: Esposito on the NT, Family, Teammates, Inter",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/io4o9i/interview_esposito_on_the_nt_family_teammates/,2020-09-07 17:51:08

Speaking at [GianlucaDiMarzio.com](https://GianlucaDiMarzio.com)'s microphones, Tommaso Berni, now a former Inter goalkeeper, told about his experience in Nerazzurro, also telling some behind-the-scenes stories: ""Goodbye? It was in the air we knew Radu would return and I had already talked about it with the club. I lived a dream, never as a child would I have imagined it. I shared the locker room with great champions and I will never stop thanking Zhang, Marotta and Piero. The ego is an ugly beast. There is a higher goal, that is that the team wins then there is the passion, for the role and in helping the teammates in difficulty. I arrived at the camp with a smile. Inter was a dream for me and I was trying to convey this joy.

&amp;#x200B;

Expulsions? When you play, you stay focused and don't notice anything from the outside, instead, you see everything. You get adrenaline pumping but you can't get rid of it and when you find the referee there... The first time I made a mistake and apologised to the whole trio. The second time, however, was excessive. I didn't do anything offensive, but with the empty stadium you could feel everything. I said just a porca t\*\*\*\*. After the match against Parma, I went to the referee's locker room and made a threatening remark. I said to him: 'Now buy me a drink. And trust me, when I drink, I drink a lot!' They all burst out laughing. Then I gave them a couple of AirPods. I am sorry to leave the Inter, also because I am convinced that he will soon raise important trophies. I will miss the San Siro bench. And you will miss me. There will no longer be a madman who cheers at every goal or who gets thrown out.

""When the team needs the ball, he moves the ball better, the team is a little bit more fluid. But one thing is the dynamic and another thing is the push, the real push, he doesn't push. That extra desire, he's missing that."" 

Without proper context, I would think Jose is talking about Eriksen's time with Inter - when he is playing, we move the ball much better and create more chances thanks to his play making abilities. But he does seem to hold back at times, especially when pressing. I wonder if that was a reason why Conte refused to give him more playing time.

I don't watch a lot of Spurs games, so for those who do/did, what role did Eriksen play under Pochettino that made him a world class player?

**You played 226 games for Tottenham  in 6 years and often was among the first names on the team card. Is it difficult to have this new role?**  

""It is something new, but then you have also experienced that. And then you have to process it and later look back on it and see if it was right or wrong. You have to take it as it comes. I would love to play more, but in the end it is the coach who decides who plays. I feel that I have done my part.

It has been seven special months. But on the whole, I'm glad I switched to Inter. And I am still happy to be there.""

**Biggest differences between England and Italy?**  

""In terms of soccer, there may be a little more flow in the game in England. In Italy, there are more situations and moments that decide the match. It is often about winning the ball and starting the play forward again, so of course I have had to get used to it. England is just more chaotic back and forth, with slightly more action, while in Italy it is more withdrawn and controlled.""

**Is italian soccer a better match for you?**  

""I do not know, but I have only been there for six months, and I was in England for more than six years, so it was something I had gotten used to completely. I have to do the same in Italy.

&gt; Achraf Hakimi has taken Serie A by storm since his arrival in the summer. The former Real Madrid full-back has not just settled immediately but has set the bar for what the modern full-back needs to be. He was outstanding in Ukraine, even though Inter failed to beat Shaktar Donetsk but as the honours were shared, the Moroccan can look back on his performance with pride. If Antonio Conte can learn how to unleash him further, he could help Inter become a much more potent team to face.

&gt; Had it not been for the brilliance of Shakhtar‚Äôs 19-year-old goalkeeper, Anatoliy Trubin, Lautaro Martinez‚Äôs inexplicable miss and the unfortunate placement of the post, then Inter could have managed to grab all three points. Conte used this narrative as he praised the performance of his team whilst also referencing the amount of games played. Whilst these points can be taken on board, the second half display was disappointing and the lack of creativity seems to be a new constant meaning that the team are left hoping that Romelu Lukaku can make the difference.

&gt; The creativity issue seems to be laid directly at the feet of the trequartista. Whether this be Nicolo Barella, Christian Eriksen or anyone else, it is seen to be these players who are supposed to unlock the defences even if they sit back deep in numbers as Donetsk did on Tuesday night. This is where arguably Conte is missing a trick. Last night Hakimi was seen on the right (especially in the second half) screaming for the ball and yet receiving it far too little. This was a surprise as his effectiveness had been exhibited against Genoa who at the time were doing exactly the same thing and sitting deep. When Hakimi came on, he was not afraid to terrorise the right hand side meaning that the Genoa players had to overload on him to protect themselves. This allowed Barella space and the Inter goal was forthcoming.

&gt; To have a full back as one of your most dangerous attacking options is not a new thing, albeit a modern characteristic. Liverpool showed how Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander Arnold could cause chaos for opposition defences last season. Since Hakimi arrived in Milan and took to the field against Fiorentina, his quality was obvious. He created an assist in that game and then scored and created one more against Benevento. His displays against Lazio and Milan were strong and the influence in the game against Genoa has been discussed.

&gt; Against Shaktar, he again showed why he is so highly thought of. Even in the opening minutes he could be seen committing himself high up the pitch but when the move broke down he recovered like and Olympic sprinter. His defensive duties are not ignored and he won all his aerial battles and those on the ground last night. His passing accuracy has never dipped below 83% (against Milan) but mostly is 90% or above. The 21-year-old is very quickly becoming one of the most important players in the squad.

&gt; Inter will continue to come up against teams that sit back and defend with six or more. This is the result of the fear that Lukaku and Martinez put in defences and when this happens, they will need to break them down. Admittedly, Hakimi cannot do this on his own and the left sided full back will also need to be able to stretch the other flank but there is no doubt that his electric pace and sublime confidence to both supply dangerous balls in and threaten goal, is a monumental asset. The space this will create for the midfield will allow them to find the opposition more often and let us not forget that even in today‚Äôs games crosses from wide areas are still a threat.

&gt; There has been much said and written about the way Conte and Inter are performing at present and it certainly seems to divide opinion. Hakimi is certainly a light that shines through the incoming clouds however and Inter can be glad they have him. It may sound strange to say, put your hopes in a 21-year-old full back but he is much more than that. So far, he is an example to the rest of the team as he is making the most of his enormous talent.",FCInterMilan,[Richard Hall - Article on Hakimi] Inter‚Äôs majestic Moroccan threat,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/jk6j21/richard_hall_article_on_hakimi_inters_majestic/,2020-10-29 16:52:42

I've always thought it's Eriksen himself who is not delivering what's expected from him, but Conte isn't helping him at all. He didn't field him the whole 90 minutes more than few times, could be counted on one hand. We are almost 1 year having Eriksen now and he played less than Gagliardini. 

The little confidence Conte is showing is reflecting on our players. They are not giving him the ball a lot. Which what they should be doing as he is the ""playmaker"" of the team. The team doesn't look for Eriksen when building the play. they are looking for Lukaku. 

The problem is Conte is expecting Eriksen to play like Vidal or Barella, instead of focusing on the strengths he has. We all saw Eriksen's perfect passes when he gets the chance to do it. He has a strong foot on goal too. Yet, I don't notice our players making runs when he has the ball, or try to pick him up when he is in good shooting position.

- Experienced in Seria A relative to his age
- Italian and 1st choice in national team
- familiar with the pressure that comes with playing in big teams
- His contract is expiring and could be signed for free

Cons:
- presumably a Milanista
- has piece of shit of an agent (Raiola)
- demands 8 million a year (more than the 7.5 threshold our top players make)
- Never played at a high level internationally (no CL, world cup, Euro, etc.. )

 *Conte: ""It is true. We also managed to get to the Europa League final, so the players already here gained more experience too. Vidal especially brings a lot of experience. We're doing great on this aspect.""*

- [Handanovic, are you concerned about the league goals conceded so far? Last year you had the best defense in the Serie A. For Conte: How is the squad shaping up for the game? Is Bastoni back?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=76)

 *Handanovic: ""Worried? Hmm. A goalkeepers doesn't like to concede. It's about life or death. However, I'm not concerned. We play a very attacking style of football and also score lots of goals. Goals bring joy. I'm focused on the situation. I think we need to be more clinical in attack, mainly.""*

 *Conte: ""As for the squad, Bastoni trained again with us today. He'll be with us, but he'll be on the bench. Unfortunately covid also impacts the fitness levels of our players... It's difficult, we need to asses the situation. Brozovic is also a bit fatigued after the derby. We need to rotate. We can't take too many risks in the Covid period, if players struggle [fitness wise], we need to make changes.""*

 Editor's note: WHO IS READY FOR GAGS MAN!

___

- [Buongiorno Antonio! Last year the four Italian teams struggles in the Champion's League. Why was that?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=269)

 *Conte: ""The explanation? In Italy the league is really balanced. We have many teams fighting for the top four spots. We saw Barcelona and Real Madrid lose abroad too last year. All in all there were quite a few odd results. If anything it seems to show that football has become more competitive all around. More of these odd-one out matches happen to the point the question should be if they are still the odd-ones out. As for us specifically, we want and have to take our future and destiny into our own hands. We have to control how things go.""*

___
- [Why are you playing with the trequartista?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=395)

 *Conte: ""We're playing with this system because I think it's the best one [for Inter] at the moment. It really gets the best out of everyone. We played that somewhat in the EL last season. Barella often has the freedom to roam. We can also change the position of the trequartista... Barella, Sensi, Eriksen, Nainggolan, Vidal.""*

 Editor's note: I think with the latter he also implies that depending on who we place there, we can play the trequartista style quite differently. All of them have different qualities.

___
- [Handanovic, have you worked on the defense in the past days? How can you have more balance?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=481)

 *Handanovic: ""We only played the other day. The key thing is to learn from errors. I'm confident we will get better at striking the balance. Each player analyses their mistakes and we will then improve. We must definitely raise our level though - the Champions League will be the right step up.""*

___
- [Spanish press: Antonio! In Spain, Inter are the favourites to win the group. Can you comment on that?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=549)

 *Conte: ""(Laughs and smiles) ... I don't know. I don't know if we're the favourites. We have the La Liga champions in our group, they have a stellar squad. They have players who won the CL - multiple times. To hear we must be the favourites, makes me smile. We need to be more balanced in our views. We cannot say things that are not true. We cannot question Real, that's my view. (Continues to smile.)""*

___
- [Ciao! Conte, do you feel like you're missing an international trophy? And for Handanovic, do you still feel like you have lots [many years] to give for Inter?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=662)

 *Conte: ""I'm getting closer to an international trophy [EL, CL]. My record shows that. But not having one is not a problem. I'm enjoying the journey regardless. I'm learning to enjoy the experience. Only one team can win in the end. But all in all, in 4 years, I'm pretty pleased. I have made progress.""*

 *Handanovic: ""(Smiles awkwardly) Why do you say that? I feel fine. Maybe that's not always the case - but I feel very motivated. Football is my passiong to me. As long as I'm here, I will continue to work hard and give it my all. While I'm capable, I'll still be playing.""*

___
- [Is S√°nchez ready?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=857)

 *Conte: ""We were worried when he came back. We didn't receive good news from Chile. He had a muscle fatigue after the international duty. We made sure to manage the situation well and to not take any risks... That's why he only played 15 minutes in the derby. Now S√°nchez has given us a guarantee. He's doing fine and he's ready to play. He's in the mix for a starting jersey.""*

___

- [Ciao Conte. I want to ask about the goals conceded. Most often these are conceded on the break, counterattack, by the opponent's team. You have a very strong and physical defense, but perhaps not the fastest players. Does this worry you for the future?](https://youtu.be/CzC7MYJnm2U?t=932)

 *Conte: ""To be honest... Last season we played this way [in terms of players]. We lost God√≠n and gained Kolarov. That's the only change. We're working hard on the defense. We take the positives we have and we look to work hard on the negatives. But I'm not overly worried, I remain optimistic and calm. The team are playing well. We're also playin an offensive style of football, not a defensive one. We came second last season. At times we look amazing, at times we don't look great and we have things to improve.""*

Lothar18,1603025301.0,jdfrmk,10.0,1.0,"First let me say that this is not me panicking after yesterday's game or anything like that, I think yesterday's game was just a setback because of Covid infections in our team combined with some bad decisions from Conte but we move on, I still think and hope we are gonna have a great season. 

Anyway, I think we need to be more clinical, we need to kill games even when we don't put on a good performance, I can site a lot of matches when we missed chances to kill the game and ended up throwing it away or best case scenario we make the game incredibly hard for us. The most recent example is the Lazio game where we could have been 3-0 up in the beginning of the 2nd half but we missed 2 easy chances and eventually drew 1-1, a lot of people blamed the Lazio game on Conte but I don't think he deserves any blame for that, other examples would be Sassuolo and Bologna after the lockdown, Napoli in the 2nd leg of the Coppa Italia, Bar√ßa at home, Roma at home, there are a lot of examples, we can even add yesterday's game against Milan as we missed a shitload of chances but that was overshadowed by the laughable defending. Don't get me wrong I m not saying we are not allowed to miss any chance, that's just impossible and yes there are games when the ball just doesn't want to go in, it happens to a lot of big teams but on an occasional level not regularly, but the difference with us is this has become more like a pattern, we see a lot of games when we are dominating and creating a shitload of chances and we somehow end up taking away 1 point or sometimes nothing, even Conte has said this numerous times in his interviews, this is not a dig at Lukaku or Lautaro as they are not the only ones who miss chances in our team.

In my opinion this is a crucial thing that we need to work on in order to win trophies and establish ourselves as one of the biggest teams in Europe.

You might remember me posting a survey on ‚ÄúFan Identification in Football‚Äù in this subreddit a few months ago as part of my bachelor thesis in Sport Management. I wanted to thank all of you who took part, as I reached almost 5.000(!) participants which made my research a lot more meaningful. Thanks to you I managed to score 94% on my thesis and graduated top of my class! My thesis will be published as an article in an academic journal in a few months time, which is something I am quite proud of. I was recently admitted to a masters degree program in Sport Management in Cologne/Germany, so I am excited for what‚Äôs to come! I thought I would post a short presentation of the results, your picks of favourite football clubs/players and general observations as some people were interested in the results and I want to give something back for all the support. The full thesis and findings will have to wait until the article is published, but I will definitely link it here once it is. Thanks again boys and girls, much love!

It's no surprise to see Man City and tottenham linked with him, but where did fulham come from? They literally only got repromoted to the premier league and they HAVE signed players, but none of them are at the calibre of skriniar and neither is anyone on their team. 

Skriniar could most definitely stay with us at Inter, but does anyone else think that it would be ridiculous if he moved to Fulham?

I know, I may have been a tad toxic against our players or staff in the past, too, but the constant ""Gagliamerda""-bullying and Conte-trashtalking (heavy insults included!) have crossed a border for me.

The discussion around u/RobinXoxoxo, including the very large thread that was made, are another factor in this decision.

But just running some simple math here, we're already paying for Conte and Spalletti, so that money is spent no matter what. Say we take Allegri, I imagine for somewhere around 8-10mil...

So basically the additional cost we're taking is exclusively the new coach's.

Consider what Conte is doing to our financials, really good and expensive players underperforming and lowering their market value. We're probably going to lose money on a world class player like Eriksen, and I'm pretty sure Allegri would have done anything to have a player like him. Plus qualifying to CL knockouts, doing well in EL, getting a top league place are all worth money.

shalom82,1606375929.0,k1auow,31.0,1.0,"Hi guys, I know you‚Äôre all feeling justifiably crap after last night‚Äôs defeat against Real.  I‚Äôm hoping to get some clarity on why Inter is doing so badly. With Conte‚Äôs arrival there was huge fanfare in Italy that finally someone was going to end Juve‚Äôs dominion. And there were moments last season where you could see the seeds of an unstoppable Inter. This summer I really thought you guys would be winning the scudo in the new season. Juve is being downgraded and has lost the confidence it had under Allegri, and your core players like Lukaku, Barella and De Vrij were, if anything, getting better. 

So what‚Äôs happening? 

And tactically, here‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. 

Your most gifted star players seem to be:

Lukaku, Eriksen, Hakimi and Barella. 

Isn‚Äôt it obvious you should be playing a 4-2-3-1? You have the players for it. 

You have Bastoni, Skriniar, De Vrij, 3 top choices for 2 roles as central defender (plus Ranocchia but let‚Äôs try and forget he exists). 

Your left back options are a bit old but definitely professionals in that role, Kolarov and Young. On the right you have D‚ÄôAmbrosio or Darmian. Ok, so this Xmas you need to ask Santa for an upgrade on fullbacks, but your guys are absolute pros and more than capable of carrying the role for a few months. 

At midfield you‚Äôre an embarrassment of riches. You have Sensi / Barella, which could work for you similarly to how Bennacer / Kessie work for us, with Barella on the left to offer some cover for your old left-backs, given their age. Eriksen is perfect for the advanced midfielder role, one of the best in Europe. And as replacements you have versatile players who can play in all three positions (offering different interpretations of the role of course) - Brozovic, Ninja, Vidal, Vecino and the straight midfielder Gagliardini. Who else in Italy has this depth?

On the wings of course you have Perisic who can be annoying but was good enough to get good playing time in a Champions League winning Bayern, as well as Sanchez if you need more striking power (a bit like our Rebic vs Leao choice in that role). On the right you have Hakimi, whom if covered adequately by the fullback would be unstoppable. I‚Äôve never seen him with Dortmund but in the derby despite it not being his best match he looked insanely talented. 

And as forward, no need to even discuss - Lukaku, the best striker in the league by a mile, and more crucial to Inter than even Ibra is to ACM, which is saying something. 

So, apologies for the lengthy post, but why isn‚Äôt the best roster in serie A, which this is, being used this way? Why play a 3-5-2 when you simply don‚Äôt have the right players for it (not enough defenders, no real left wing-back) and it wastes what is arguably your best player after Lukaku (Eriksen)?

Thanks, and good luck (although i really can‚Äôt wish good luck to that rubentino Conte)",FCInterMilan,Tactical question from ACM fan,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/k1auow/tactical_question_from_acm_fan/,2020-11-26 15:32:09
vik1980,1606358035.0,k16maq,7.0,1.0,"Some time back, I'd made a post about how Spalletti needs a system which incorporates both Icardi and Lautaro. I'd advocated that the single forward system was becoming stagnant, and there needed to be an alternate solution. 

Well, that never happened, and he was gone soon enough. 

However, the teams struggles this season lead me to think we need an alternate system. The three man backline is becoming stagnant for Conte. However, it's not the attack I'm worried about now. It's defense. We need to have a 4 man backline system in place as an alternate. Maybe a 4-3-1-2, if you will. Bastoni &amp; DV are both comfortable in that system. And Skriniar looked his his old self, a beast, when we converted to it last night in the second half. We started looking threatening, after an absolutely impotent first half.

What's surprising is that Conte himself started with a 4 man backline (the 4-2-4 system) when he first started. Since, he's shifted to the 3 man backline. I think he should start exploring it again.",FCInterMilan,Do we need an alternate system?,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/k16maq/do_we_need_an_alternate_system/,2020-11-26 10:33:55

I am making an Inter Milan canvas wall in my new house and am looking for the best historic photos in our teams history. The idea is to do it in a timeline style with the centrepeice photo being Zanetti lifting the CL trophy. Some of the others I plan on having are Ronaldo in the horizontally striped shirt, Samuel celebrating 4-3 goal vs Sienna, Stankovics half way goal, Icardi (please dont start pro/anti Icardi debate, i come in peace) holding his shirt celebration. 

So far the majority of them are from the 2010 era, which is obviously the most impactful time for me. But if you have any hidden gems from any point in our history I would love to see them!

Yes I get it, it's not all his fault, of course. But this guy is totally changed this season. He is ""very satisfied"" after every performance, and if the translation of this statement is correct (I dont know Italian) he is basically saying what - that it doesn't matter if you get the best coach or a great signing if the team is not used to winning? Like, is he washing his hands of us already? And if it doesn't matter how good of a coach you get, why do we have the best paid coach in the league?

adrenalinda75,1605079391.0,js3prp,26.0,1.0,"TL;DR: *This is a long read, mind you.*  *I do believe that Conte has his responsibilities, but it's too simple an explanation to fully encompass the current negative streak we're facing. There is more at play than just a stubborn trainer.*

Fellow aching and agonizing fans of the Beneamata

I'm following with scrutiny many posts here and required some time yet again to digest our Atalanta game. In a nutshell Conte's stubbornness onto his prelibate formation and here and there Handa entering a critical age and phase of his career are some centerpieces of the debate. Since nothing is simple, I'd like to provide some food for thought about the things we don't know or which we simply deny because, well, because it's easier.

**It's not all Conte**

So Conte has his faults and I won't be arguing his donkey attitude and the lack of sensitivity for the right subs - but that's just not all of it - I believe.

**Where our troubles started**

Many state it's a bad start into the season and I agree. But the first game in the era Conte 2.0  wasn't ground zero for us. The decline started already by the ending of the last season with a couple of games left to the end, culminating in our Europacup defeat. I wouldn't underestimate what kind of blow it is to be bested in a final. Already by the start of that game I could feel our batteries were close to empty. We got to the final, nobody was expecting it. We lost and the scars didn't fully heal yet.

**The exiled**

I think the balance of a locker room is something crucial for a team and with the likes of Ninja and Perisic returning, players nobody was really expecting back (some might) I don't think it is easy to find stability. This is something bothering me beyond comprehension and I believe that it's not all rainbows, especially at the moment. Though I lack the ability to define a true culprit the current setup cannot be good. It might be just me, but I feel that since Perisic's return Brozo lost quality.

**The new and the lack of a revelation**

Sanchez was a positive surprise, but he's falling victim to his frantically wanting to prove how great he is/could be. By his age he should have understood to take a gear down and chill a little more. A dent more calm and he wouldn't lose all those balls or pass it a bit sooner. Hakimi - aside from the Real mistake - doesn't seem this long legged gazelle with immaculate sprint we were able to admire during the first games. Something is troubling the boy and it shows. The mystery of Eriksen, which yet remains to be resolved and in a totally different context reminds me a bit of Gabigol. Kolarov, an admirable player with a declining star in the night sky. What should I say. I'm grateful for the roster, but it's nothing spectacular. Vidal is still the fierce warrior we came to admire, but he runs out of fuel after an hour and it shows. It's great to have such an ankle biter in the midfield and it's awesome to see him chasing the ball like a mad dog, but the formidable player we once knew just runs for a half-time.

**The captain**

I'm not very happy with Handa's performance at the moment and especially goalkeepers remain prone to not recuperating once their mindset can't keep up anymore. Once insecurities kick in it is hard to recover. But Handa is Handa and I do believe he could still deliver a stellar season. I believe he also - like everyone else - is hindered by the collective frustration and the lack of nerves everyone is displaying, so that's not something I'll make him responsible for. What I believe is that he is not a captain figure. He's too docile and calm as a leader and I think the current locker room situation is not something he can manage. I have no clue about his standings within the team but I played first division myself and trained youth squads to know captain material. I'm not expecting a hot head obviously, but it also cannot be the pacific giant you can't feel at all during a game.

**A streak and not a pattern**

Aside from some awful playing, slow buildup and very static players when not in possession and almost no capability to create a fast counter I don't see us being awful. We had our fair share of chances and really threw them to the wind. Luck can be a factor as does probability. I do believe that fortune will change for the better and that the situation remains delicate. It's just very important that Conte realizes that everybody in Europe and Serie A has seen through his scheme and that only adaptability will save him. So I see a chance that the current streak can be reversed completely if certain things fall into our favour.

**The Inter factor**

VAR wasn't kind to us - and it never will be as seldom will be the referees. This season alone however we could have different outcomes in at least three games with a less tilted view about Inter. But we're a hated team and everyone learned to cope. It's not a final judgement but a frustrating fact sometimes. And there are us fans, capable of feeling like conquering the world after a 2:0 vs Genoa and shouting sh\*t team after a 3:2 defeat vs Real, crying trash and shit. This is not healthy and is typical for a biased, non objective view. I think we're a bunch of cockroaches in that regard - either we're having a party once the lights turn on or we sprint into the safety of the shadows shouting paroles about all that is wrong with the team. It's crazy.

**Further thoughts**

I will for the time being, despite it being quite a suffering, continue to watch the games and kick chairs and my remote control around the house when we fail simple passes, when we miss big chances, when we run into a counter like 7 years old kids, when we concede penalties as premature Christmas gifts, when our subs come in too late and are the wrong ones on top - but I do hope that my passion for this sport is sparkled again by a collective wake-up. I do not believe that replacing Conte is a solution - aside from it not truly being a financial option.

I will cling to our marvelous realities like De Vrij, Barella, Lautaro, Lukaku and well yes, Handa and hope that this is the spine to save us from the current situation.

Eriksen clearly has performed better in the Premier League with the Spurs. Be it the coaching of Conte or whatever logical reason one may come up with.

Roaming_Dinosaur,1604754213.0,jpqhrv,14.0,1.0,"Hi guys, I was bored so I decided to do a little thing. It‚Äôs called _Inter Luck Index_.

Basically, it‚Äôs a number ranging from -1 to 1 that indicates how strong is the correlation between how many Inter games you watch/don‚Äôt watch and the final result of each game, just to see if you bring good or bad luck to our Nerazzurri.

You get points based on whether you‚Äôve watched the game or not (Event 1):

Watched: 1
Not watched: -1

Also, you get points based on the result of the game (Event 2):

Win: 1
Draw: -1/3
Defeat: -1

(The scores are normalized to fit a -1 to 1 range but still keep the proportion of 3/1/0 based on the points the team gets by obtaining a win/draw/defeat).

After that, you simply multiply the points of the two events that have occurred:

Watched | Win: 1
Watched | Draw: -1/3
Watched | Defeat: -1
Not Watched | Win: -1
Not Watched | Draw: 1/3
Not Watched | Defeat: 1

To get the final index just sum up the points you got for each game and then divide by the total number of games. If your score is closer to -1 you‚Äôre probably not bringing good luck to Inter; if it‚Äôs closer to 1, good for you (and us)!

That would put us near the top of the league. By more luck I mean less missed sitters, less bad ref decisions, no big injuries and no more covid. We've been lucky in the past, and we're having an unlucky period now. It will end.

In the champions league even if we somehow manage to lose against Real again we can realistically hope for 6 points in the last 2 games, putting us at 8. Again, with a bit of luck that may be enough to go through because the group is close.

It's in our DNA to be a mad, unstable, exciting team. The real supporters know they cannot relax when we're 3-0 up, but also know that anything can happen when we're 2-0 down at the 80th. If you are only just realising this then maybe you should just embrace it, because it's part of supporting the most beautiful team in the world.

UnsuppressedAnger,1604483676.0,jnu1xl,11.0,1.0,"Almost everything he was known for, he came up short of it. In his first year I was convinced we underachieved because of lack of high quality players. But there‚Äôs some point at the last season when Conte changed his mentality and became more passive. Something he was brought to NOT be. 

I believe the changing point was the game against Bologna. A game we lost in a humiliating manner. Surely, there was precedents, like Dortmund and Barcelona in CL, but this one we had better quality, something he previously blamed. After this game Conte said something like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a situation where you thought you are at some level, but you aren‚Äôt‚Äù. 

I think this is when he realized he can‚Äôt win with us anymore, not with current team. And without some sort of market coup, and the management pressure to win, he had to adopt another approach. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúto win‚Äù but to ‚Äúnot lose‚Äù. A passive, risk-minimizing approach. I think it‚Äôs very obvious that we play a similar football to Spaletti‚Äôs. (slow build-up play, non-aggressive pressure, big dependency on wings) 

Some pundits say his lack of press conference rants is an indicator he doesn‚Äôt wanna win anymore. Surely no manager will mind wining, but that makes sense in the above context. These rants disappeared for a reason. Last season after EL he said he could leave, and after 1 meeting he was convinced to stay. After each game we fail, instead of complaining, he give us the ‚Äúwe are on the right path‚Äù statement. How come he is suddenly convinced of the project after long history of criticizing it?

I believe it‚Äôs because the management has faith in him more than he has in the team. That‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt ranting anymore, he is repeating the management words. He is now ‚Äúgoing for the ride‚Äù not leading us anywhere. Another evidence of him compromising integrating Perisic after rejecting him in the 1st season. Simply because the management couldn‚Äôt sell him. And now he is praising him when he is the 1st one to criticize and ship him away.

I respect the guy and think he is the best we had after Mourinho, but now we are seeing someone in a place he doesn‚Äôt want to be. And we need something more than that right now. It‚Äôs not his fault he is in a project he doesn‚Äôt believe in, when the management has more faith and paying him very well.",FCInterMilan,Conte failed at Inter because he failed at being himself.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/jnu1xl/conte_failed_at_inter_because_he_failed_at_being/,2020-11-04 17:54:36

vik1980,1604231214.0,jm0yvm,6.0,1.0,"In America, at some point, the President delivers a 'State of the Union' address, where he addresses the most important issues the country and the Govt. face etc. Well, this is my 'State of the Union' address as a fan. 

1- The defense - When Conte first joined, off just a few pre-season friendlies, I'd made what now seems like a poignant remark, that if Spalletti had the defense at 100, and the attack at 60, Conte seems to have dialled the defense back to 80, but pushed the attack u to 100. Well, after the last transfer window, that seems to have amplified. Conte seems intent on playing a very attacking brand of football, and his solution to his conservative, counterattacking 3-5-2 is to push the line up tremendously, and use the wingbacks at impromptu wingers, while the wide centre backs act like a hybrid centre back/ full back role. It's why he uses full backs (Kolarov, Dambo, Darmian) in that role. They have the pace to cover counters on the break when they loose possession in the attacking third, and the ball playing skills to develop the attacks. However, they're not proper centre backs, and lack positioning when defending centrally, or facing proper attacks. 

2- Pinamonti - I'm impressed in the few minutes he's gotten till now. He seems to be developing a critical aspect of Conte's play style, the hold up and link up play. Conte likes a forward to trap the ball, &amp; shield it from defenders while his teammates get into positions. It's why he craves for Jeko as Lukaku back-up. Because he's old, on big wages, and important for Roma, he's not come here. Conte now seems to be developing Pina in the same mould, and it's showing promise. Obviously he still doesn't fully trust him, otherwise he'd have started against Parma. 

3- Eriksen - When he first joined, I'd made a post claiming this transfer will make or break this team. Dramatic words, but well founded. Each time he doesn't start, it's news. If he starts and plays well, it's news. It doesn't play well, it's news. Conte would probably love to avoid all that attention. Also, given his wages (same as Lukaku), and role, it's not ideal. Keep in mind, we chose him over Kulusevski in Jan. How Conte would've loved Alli instead of him. All in all, it's time to end the experiment asap. If we can get a serious buyer (30-40m; thus recouping what we've paid in fee and wages), he should go in Jan. Then we go after a more suited replacement (Alli on loan, exchange for De Beek). 

4- Midfield - All in all, I'm quite happy here. I'd love to see cash for Vecino, and to bench Gagli (can't understand why Conte trusts him so much; especially over Nainggolan). That said, there's plenty of depth in that department. 

5- Conte and Rijkaard's situation - Not sure how many here would remember this, but there was a time when Barca had spent a lot of money for Ronaldinho, and taken Rijkaard as coach. This was the first season under new President Laporta. They were struggling for results (getting beaten, draws etc.). Laporta, under pressure to fix things, after discussing things with his coach, decided to not fire him. Instead, he backed him further, swinging a deal for Davids from Ju**B**e to shore up the midfield and add some defensive spine in the middle to cover his forwards. It worked. The turnaround was instantaneous. 

The reason I mention this is, I think we're in the same boat. We need a new central defender. We need to show more patience with Conte (yes, I do believe this), and Conte needs to show more patience with both his 3 man system as the players.  We need find a proper central defender, one who can play the three man backline better. Milenkovic from Fiorentina is perfect. Izzo (exchange for Vecino) should be the budget option. Then there's the fancy foreign options (Kabak, Ginter etc.). 

So, here's where we are. Struggling for points, open defense, lots of questions about the system, the star signing etc. I do, however, think there's light at the end of the tunnel. I think that we've shown strength so far, despite the results not showing it. I think we're set up perfectly for Real, and should (will!) shock people in that game, and then start to find our stride after that game.",FCInterMilan,The 'State of the Union' address,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/jm0yvm/the_state_of_the_union_address/,2020-11-01 19:46:54

&amp;#x200B;

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ht4VJdRUknPC\_QX0rxVQ-dPnYBiV6MFjbhafs9ZGePY/edit?ouid=112510706249835978487&amp;usp=sheets\_home&amp;ths=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ht4VJdRUknPC_QX0rxVQ-dPnYBiV6MFjbhafs9ZGePY/edit?ouid=112510706249835978487&amp;usp=sheets_home&amp;ths=true)

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers are probably good (at a top level) to like 3-5% I guess. As I said in another thread, FFP has driven a lot of what Inter has done in the last 10 years, and I suspect will continue to do so for a few years. It's also why you see all those weird Ausilio-style plusvalenza transactions on our youth.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not a perfect overview of our books - e.g. staff salaries, infrastructure costs, etc, aren't included, but its the majority of what our expenditure does go on. What, IMHO, is most interesting, is column G. That's the (start of season) residual value of our players, and if you guess their market value, you can work out where our highest plusvalenza or minusvalenza is - for example De Vrij has a very low book value, as does Lautaro, Brozovic, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The key thing - the easiest way to make plusvalenza is (1) selling youth \[book value 0\], (2) selling longer term players \[heavily depreciated\], (3) selling players who are worth a lot more than we paid, in quick succession \[e.g. Bastoni, Barella\]

philipagg,1608023553.0,kdigl1,27.0,1.0,"Hello Fans of Fc Internazionale Milano. Today, i am curious about your opinions for this matter. Who do you believe was more right. Mauro Icardi or the management at that time of our beloved club (spalletti etc.) ?


For me, personally i would go with the management althought both sides poorly handled (or didn't want to handleü§îü§î) the situation. 

Inter could have just told to that mistake of an agent that is his wife (yes i like her a lot as you can see #not) that they want to postpone the contract talks due to summer to negotiate without distracting icardi from the little amount of matches he played that year. And icardi did deserve the salary tbh considering he is our 10th top scorer for the team and still consistent.

But also Icardi could tell his wife to postpone the contract talks himself and could have told her to not talk shit or anything about the locker room and finally i can't go with icardi's side when he says ""yeah i love the team"" and before psg asks for him he tries to SUE THE CLUB.

(For anyone who cares, i used to be an Icardi fanboy and well i saw him as one of our shinning hopes during the amazingly bad era that was this decade... I still remember the hat-trick against Milan... but he disappointed me a lot.) 


Yeah ok that's my opinion pretty much.

Lothar18,1607608409.0,kafml4,12.0,1.0,"I want to start off by saying I only read this on Twitter so it's not my original idea, here's the [original tweet](https://twitter.com/marifcinter/status/1336981025281495041) if you want to check it out. So the point is if we sell Eriksen in January, not loan him but sell him, it would be a huge indication that Conte will be confirmed again in the summer no matter what happens this season, whether we win the Scudetto or not, Conte will be the manager again for next season because selling Eriksen and buying another Conte player who fits his style would be a move to accommodate Conte and an indication that the club wants to continue with him for next season.

If that is not the case then it would be an amateurish move by the management because if we sell Eriksen in January and bring in a player in his position who fits Conte's style and then fire Conte at the end of the season and bring in another manager who could have different ideas about Eriksen and could have may be made him work would be a stupid move by the management. Anyways this is the entire point of the tweet.

I didn't post the tweet directly because I wanted to make a post about it and give my take on the situation as well, I think his point is a very valid point and I tend to agree with it but imo there's another situation in which Eriksen would like to leave no matter what, don't get me wrong I know there is a 99% chance Eriksen has already submitted his transfer request, my point is he would like to leave no matter what, even if Marotta tells him relax just finish the season with us and there will be another manager at the end of the season, Eriksen would still like to leave simply because he's had it and he wouldn't want to rot on the bench the entire season especially with the Euro in the summer, he would like to be in the best shape to play in it with Denmark, Marotta and Zhang could obviously block the transfer request but if Eriksen is very adament on leaving in January they won't keep him, and therefore it wouldn't be an indication that the club wants to continue with Conte no matter what happens this season.

This is just my take on it, I want to hear what you guys think about this.",FCInterMilan,The future of Conte and Eriksen,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/kafml4/the_future_of_conte_and_eriksen/,2020-12-10 21:53:29

We‚Äôve had a very rocky start in the league. We lost the derby, we can‚Äôt keep a clean sheet against teams that aren‚Äôt even challenging for an EL spot. Last night we couldn‚Äôt even make the knockout stages (three years in a row now. Saw the post earlier) against a team that wanted the third place. At least the past years we had the Europa League and a worse starting 11 so that‚Äôs sort of understandable. 

With the current depth that we have we‚Äôre somehow doing worse than last year. I don‚Äôt get it. 

The Serie A is the only thing I want now. I don‚Äôt care about the Coppa Italia at all. There‚Äôs no excuse for them to actually not win the competition after the shit I‚Äôve seen last night. We deserve it for fucks sake.

(Not confirmed for the latter yet) Conte unlikely to depend on Eriksen in such an important and highly tactical game. Moments ago, Conte brought D'ambrosio with him in the press conference. Usually the player in press conference play an important role in the upcoming game. Yet, I can't see D'ambrosio play when Darmian/Hakimi performed far better in the RWB. Same goes in defense, Skriniar has been solid since his return, it would be ridiculous to bench him in such important match to play D'ambrosio who isn't even a natural CB. 

So, what exactly Conte is planning? Some reports say Perisic could be used in midfield. (Repubblica) Would Conte really play D'ambrosio in midfield and leave Eriksen on bench? (LOL) Or is he planning a new module? (probably 3-4-3 with Hakimi and Sanchez on the wings) This is going to be interesting.

Now heres where it gets interesting, while inter was playing bad, cagliardini was covid positive, he came back against torino and been playing every game since then. Eversince that inter has improved much more. Do you thing that cagliardini is such an important part of inters team? Many of us borderline hate him, he really does seem like quite a limited player and i also really cant determine what key role he has in contes system that no one else can fill besides him. But conte always counts on him and in the recent games it looks like he did everything right.

After that, it's mostly been 3, 4 or more goal thrillers. Inter Fiorentina (4-3), Inter-BMG (2-2 &amp; 2-3), Inter-Real (2-3), Inter-Milan (1-2), Inter-Parma (2-2) &amp; Inter-Torino (4-2).

In fact, the only teams to outscore Inter (23 goals) in the top five leagues are Bayern (31) &amp; PSG (30); both in lopsided leagues. PSG have also played 3 more games so far.

In defence, Inter have conceded 13 so far. Out of the European spots (Top 5/6) teams in the top five leagues, only Liverpool (17), Bayern (13) &amp; Monaco (16) have conceded more. Both Liverpool and Monaco have played 1 &amp; 3 games more respectively. 

In simple words, the matches have been wild. And fun (strictly from a neutral point-of-view). I don't know how sustainable this is, or how long it'll last, but it's an experience.

*Inter coach Antonio Conte insists he didn‚Äôt request the club to sign Edin Dzeko and claims Christian Eriksen ‚Äòcan‚Äôt only play‚Äô for free kicks.*

*Inter and Roma are in talks over a possible swap deal between Edin Dzeko and Alexis Sanchez.*

&gt; ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask anything to the owners. I‚Äôve always said we are going to keep hold of our players until the end of the season,‚Äù Conte said at a press conference.

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to talk about Dzeko, because he is a player of Roma and I respect his club and my players. The situation is clear, nobody is leaving, unless someone is unhappy and hands in a transfer request.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôll have a chance to do something without spending money then we may do it. We can only work and stay quiet,‚Äù he continued.

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want these distractions for my team.

&gt; ‚ÄúSanchez is a player of Inter and must remain concentrated,‚Äù the coach added.

*The Nerazzurri host Benevento at the Stadio Meazza tomorrow.*

&gt; ‚ÄúThey are doing so well, I am happy for Pippo [Inzaghi]. Now the ‚Äògirone di ritorno‚Äô begins, every point will be heavier. Everyone will be much more focused in the second part of the season.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe are working hard, but we can do more. Work on the finish, work on the quality of the last pass. We create many goal scoring opportunities, but we must be more determined. We can and we must improve.‚Äù

*Christian Eriksen scored a last-minute free kick winner against Milan on Tuesday.*

&gt; ""In rugby, there are players who come off the bench for set pieces,"" Conte said with a smile on his face.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe are hoping Christian can help us also in different situations. He can be an extra weapon for us, but a player can‚Äôt only stay on the pitch for the free kicks,‚Äù Conte warned.

*The coach will be suspended for the next two Serie A games.*

&gt; ‚ÄúI asked the club not to appeal my ban. We have to accept these situations. If that‚Äôs what they decided, we must accept it, whether it‚Äôs right or wrong. We prepared the game yesterday and we‚Äôll do the same today. I have a very prepared staff that will replace me perfectly.‚Äù

*Matias Vecino scored a goal with the Primavera team yesterday.*

&gt; ‚ÄúWe agreed he must play some games, but it‚Äôs difficult to organise friendlies. We hope he can reach the peak of his form as soon as possible. Sensi is working too.‚Äù

*Romelu Lukaku will be suspended in the first leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final against Juve next week, but the Sporting Judge could also open an investigation on possible discrimination against the Inter striker.*

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care a possible investigation. I must coach my players, Romelu was on a yellow card and, therefore, he will be suspended.‚Äù",FCInterMilan,"Conte's interview regarding his suspension, D≈æeko transfer, Benevento game, Eriksen's contribution and comments on Lukaku and Vecino.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/l7soks/contes_interview_regarding_his_suspension_d≈æeko/,2021-01-29 21:36:28

[Ver Video de Goles de Marco Van Basten](https://www.facebook.com/102335985070947/videos/2864198403865429)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbayu58gj5d61.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402842b17578ef27c4356aa8f7a4e4e7b5a688ea

**Or√≠genes**  
Fue el menor de tres hijos de Leny y Joop van Basten. Su hermana se llama Carla y su hermano Stanley.

Debido a que su abuela materna ten√≠a problemas para pronunciar el nombre de Marcel, se convirti√≥ en Marco poco despu√©s de su nacimiento.

Cuando era joven vio a su amigo Jopie hundirse en el hielo en Maarssen. Hizo todo lo que pudo para ayudarlo, pero no pudo evitar que se ahogara.

**F√∫tbol**  
Comenz√≥ a jugar en un equipo local cuando ten√≠a seis a√±os. Un a√±o despu√©s, se traslad√≥ a Utrecht y desde los nueve a√±os jug√≥ brevemente en el desconocido Elinkwijk.

Centro Delantero, jugaba como √∫nico punta o acompa√±ado de otro delantero. En ocasiones tambi√©n jug√≥ de extremo derecho o media punta.

**Ajax de Amsterdam**  
Hizo su debut en el Ajax de Amsterdam con tan solo diecis√©is a√±os, equipo con el que conseguir√≠a tres ligas y tres copas de Holanda y la Recopa de Europa de 1987.

**Selecci√≥n nacional**  
Su brillante juego (fue m√°ximo goleador de la liga holandesa en tres ocasiones) le llev√≥ a jugar con la selecci√≥n nacional de su pa√≠s, con la que entre 1983 y 1993 marcar√≠a 24 goles, uno de los cuales, frente a la selecci√≥n de la Uni√≥n Sovi√©tica, permiti√≥ a Holanda conseguir el triunfo en la Eurocopa de 1988.

Dotado de una clase excepcional, van Basten era capaz de dar la vuelta a cualquier partido. Capaz de disparar desde cualquier sitio, con cualquier efecto, van Basten adem√°s de chutar sab√≠a regatear, rematar de cabeza y jugar sin bal√≥n.

**Atletic Club M√≠lan**  
Fichado por el M√≠lan italiano en 1987, vivi√≥ sus mejores momentos como deportista en ese club, ganando tres t√≠tulos de la liga italiana (1988, 1992 y 1993), dos de Copa de Europa (1989 y 1990) dos de Supercopa de Europa (1990 y 1991) y dos de Copa Intercontinental (1989 y 1990). En el M√≠lan jug√≥ un total de 147 partidos marcando 90 goles.

**Lesiones**  
Su carrera estuvo plagada de lesiones que amenazaron constantemente su continuidad en el f√∫tbol. Su carrera acab√≥ por una lesi√≥n de tobillo cr√≥nica que le oblig√≥ a retirarse en 1995, aunque jug√≥ su √∫ltimo partido en 1993. Finalmente, acept√≥ la propuesta de bloquearse el tobillo para siempre uni√©ndoselo con el resto de la pierna. Ya no pod√≠a doblarlo o girarlo. Desde entonces no pudo correr, pero dej√≥ de sentir dolor.

**Bal√≥n de Oro**  
En 1986 recibi√≥ la Bota de Oro (trofeo otorgado anualmente por la revista francesa France Football al m√°ximo goleador de las competiciones de liga europeas) y en tres ocasiones (1988, 1989 y 1992) el Bal√≥n de Oro (t√≠tulo otorgado cada a√±o por la misma publicaci√≥n al mejor jugador europeo).

**Entrenador**  
En 2004, fue entrenador de la selecci√≥n holandesa, que dirigi√≥ hasta junio de 2008 tras la Copa Mundial de F√∫tbol de 2006 y la Eurocopa 2008.

En julio de 2008, fue contratado por el Ajax √Åmsterdam, que entren√≥ hasta final de dicha temporada. Adem√°s, dirigi√≥ a SC Heerenveen y AZ Alkmaar.

**Familia**  
El 21 de junio de 1993 se cas√≥ con Liesbeth van Capelleveen en Haarzuilens. En ese momento ten√≠an dos hijas y despu√©s tuvieron un hijo. Vivieron en Badhoevedorp durante mucho tiempo, pero cuando se convirti√≥ en entrenador del Ajax en 2008, decidieron mudarse a Amsterdam

Cerozz,1611413867.0,l3dhq4,8.0,1.0,"In case anybody doesn't know, Lucien Agoume is an 18 year old French player that is currently loaned out by Inter to Spezia. We bought him in 2019 from FC Sochaux for ‚Ç¨4.5m after he impressed in senior team at such a young age.

Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, he's gotten a fair change now at Spezia due to some absences and he's been able to rack solid minutes lately. He has now started (and in most cases played the full game) in all of the last 5 Spezia's Serie A fixtures. 

What's more interestingly, and could be said to be a coincidence due to small sample size and fixture difficulty difference, is that Spezia have racked some great results this season and have done well when he's playing. 

**Spezia's record without Agoume** 

*Record:* 3 wins, 3 draws and 7 losses

Lothar18,1611058428.0,l0ior2,25.0,1.0,"Certainly our best game this season and one of our best games under Conte for sure, but is it our best result under Conte ? 

I think so yes, the win against Juve is our best result under Conte so far, not only because we defeated our most hated rivals, but also because we have bottled impotant games like this for the past year and a half, we lost to Bar√ßa, Real and Juve twice, these are the biggest teams we played against thus far under Conte, we played great against Bar√ßa away and we lost, we lost against their B team at home (I would say choked rather than lost), we played great against Real away and we lost, we lost against them at home, we lost against Juve home and away last season, we played on par with them at home but we were outclassed in the away game. No matter how well we play, we were never able to translate our good performances against these big teams into a win, and we were also never able to scrape a win either, but on Sunday we put on a phenomenal dominant performance, the players were phenomenal, Conte was phenomenal in the way he set up the game, it's like I said he literally gave a lecture to Pirlo, and the most important thing is that we were able to translate that performance into a win which will give the players a huge confidence that they can win games like this in the future, and it will also make them more mature.

Sure yeah this is the least strong Juve in the past 10 years but they are still strong, they just defeated Milan 3-1 at home and won against Bar√ßa, but that doesn't matter really because like I said above we bottled every important game against teams like Juve, Bar√ßa and Real no matter how weak they are at the moment we face them, so finally winning a game like this and with the way we did has to mean smth right ?",FCInterMilan,Is the win against Juve our best and biggest result under Conte ?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/l0ior2/is_the_win_against_juve_our_best_and_biggest/,2021-01-19 20:13:48

I wanted to know how Inter fans remember certain players, whether or not they are still respected or now disliked due to their time spent at rival clubs, media comments etc. When players move between London clubs it seems to taint their legacy but such moves are more common in Italian football from what I can see. If anyone could provide some insight it would be appreciated.

Cerozz,1610727789.0,kxxuxp,2.0,1.0,"Full article: https://www.football-italia.net/164805/contes-game-management-must-change

&gt; Gianluca Mancini‚Äôs 86th minute equaliser was seen as inevitable, at least according to the Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday. This was not something that was viewed as unlucky, or as a one off but as a disturbing trend for Inter.

&gt; Antonio Conte‚Äôs substitutions and in-game management are now coming up for heavy criticism. The football betting odds were in favour of the Nerazzurri as they progressed past Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia, but what should have been seen as a very good result, instead saw questions asked on starting personal and substitutions as the game ran dep into extra time.

&gt; Cast one‚Äôs mind back to last weekend at the Stadio Olimpico. Inter had a torrid first half against Roma, but came out in the second all guns blazing. It was a familiar story, a slow start made palatable by the sheer intensity of the attacking power they have.

&gt; They drew level, then went ahead but then it fell apart. Inter have not been able to see games out this term and have been much better when on the continued offensive, instead not learning from lessons of the past, the Inter coach once again tried to see out the game.

&gt; As soon as these defensive changes were made, they sat deep and ultimately conceded. The Italian media looked at the situation at Inter and came to the same conclusion. This was that the Milanese have one of the worst records when bringing players in off the bench.

&gt; It certainly was highlighted against Roma, but this was not the first time changes by Conte had either slowed the game down or failed to be effective in anyway.

&gt; The Nerazzurri have only scored four goals from substitutes this season which if far below par when looking at their direct rivals, Inter have been free scoring but there performances have been erratic and players like Ivan Perisic, Arturo Vidal, Roberto Gagliardini and others have not offered the same intensity or effectiveness as wanted.

&gt; Inter faced Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia in midweek, Conte had decisions to make. He decided to leave the likes of Achraf Hakimi, Nicolo Barella, Marcelo Brozovic, Stefan De Vrij and Romelu Lukaku on the bench, as the Derby D‚ÄôItalia against Juventus looms large on the weekend.

&gt; Christian Eriksen played as a deep lying midfielder and the coach assumed he would have enough to navigate the game. As the game stood at 1-1, the coach decided to start putting the above players on for his tiring team that had taken to the pitch.

&gt; Desperate to avoid extra time he pushed them on but it took until the end of extra time when a late header from Lukaku sealed victory. Was this the right move? Potentially, this was correct but what effect will this have on the weekend‚Äôs game?

&gt; The difficulty is that the Roma game was a microcosm of the season. This poor game management had not been noticed against the smaller teams, as often Inter had too much quality and would have enough firepower to scrape through.

&gt; Against the big clubs, it mattered more and the poor results against Inter‚Äôs main rivals explained this. Draws against Lazio, Roma and Atalanta and defeat to Milan, the Champions League also highlighted this, as the campaign was a disaster.

&gt; After the Roma game Conte was asked about this and said, ‚ÄúI think there was a bit of anxiety to get an important result. We told the players to continue to press, because sitting deep is not a good thing. Roma had nothing to lose and tried to push ahead, its normal.‚Äù

&gt; He then went on to say that his teams also concede goals when pushing to high up the field, a statement that after his first quote indicated that he was himself unsure of his best plan when in game.

&gt; The Derby D‚ÄôItalia is not season defining but it will ask questions of the Nerazzurri coach again in a big game. Tactically, Andrea Pirlo will expect a dangerous, high pressing aggressive Inter but he will know that they will either start slow or run out of energy at some point.

&gt; He will then play his chess move and Conte will have to react. He needs to know whether his team are being caught on the break, he will have to judge if Inter are looking like they can sit back, he will have to make the right substitutions.",FCInterMilan,[Richard Hall Article] Conte's game management must change,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/kxxuxp/richard_hall_article_contes_game_management_must/,2021-01-16 00:23:09

Lothar18,1610373604.0,kv35oh,9.0,1.0,"I m basing this entire post on the fact that we won't buy anyone in this transfer window, because both Conte and Marotta said yesterday that there will be no movements in the market and that they are considering to confirm this group of players.

The midfielder who starts alongside Brozo and Barella is usually either Gaglia or Vidal, who are simply not good enough, and even if let's say Vidal improves, what good will it be to play with 3 fighters in the middle who will struggle to create, sure they can work against teams who are very inferior to us but we will always encounter problems against good teams or teams who sit back and defend well, a midfield of Brozo Barella Vidal will always have limits and that's mainly because of Vidal, what's his role in our midfield ? a B2B ? we already have Barella doing that, yesterday the commentator was asking this exact same question, he's just a liability like Gaglia there, he should just be a backup to Barella.

Our midfield should be Brozo Barella and a creative midfielder, an offensive minded one, we have 2 of those in the team, Sensi and Eriksen, Sensi doesn't offer guarantees to stay fit, even tho Conte said that he was fit and in great condition and yet we haven't seen him in the past 2 games, he is perfect for that position, as we have all seen whenever he plays, the team looks a lot better, so hopefully he can stay fit and help us this season.

The other creative mid we have is Eriksen, this is a tricky situation, he didn't fit the team, it would have been better to sell him and get someone who fits but apparently there are no offers and it's likely that he's staying, so in this case I think he should definitely be given another chance, because we simply cannot have a midfielder of his qualities on the bench for the rest of the season and starting the likes of Vidal and Gaglia, what I would like to see is Marotta setting up a meeting with Eriksen and Conte and convincing them that they need to work with each other for the good of the team, meaning Conte should try to integrate him again in either this formation or the one he used against Verona, just not that fucking 3-4-1-2, and Eriksen should agree to do the best he possibly can, you know like a clean slate, fresh start like nothing happened, and btw this is the way Tottenham fixed the issue between Mourinho and Ndomebe and it worked, he's now an undisputable starter, we should at least try to do this because working together is the best possible solution.

So in conclusion I would like to see more of Sensi and Eriksen alongside Brozo and Barella, it's the best thing that could possibly happen for the team, however if Sensi fails to stay fit and the integration of Eriksen fails once again, that would suck and I would honestly prefer to play with just Barella and Brozo in the middle like the 3-4-2-1, and in that case Conte will have to be flexible to fix this problem which he's not very good at, so it's gonna be difficult but necessary because I repeat that position in the midfield is very weak and it is a problem that we need to fix or else the midfield will always have limits.",FCInterMilan,The midfielder that plays next to Brozo and Barella,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/kv35oh/the_midfielder_that_plays_next_to_brozo_and/,2021-01-11 22:00:04

Now that we finally seem to have an advantage in the title race over Juve, I am increasingly alarmed at AC Milan's form and their chances to be a tough contender.
Lately everything seems to be going in the right direction for them. Snatched a lot of useful points in the very last minutes. Defeated Benevento away despite a 1-man disadvantage. Theo is a beast player. The entire team is really overperforming themselves despite lots of injuries.

Luck is surely a factor but do you think they can really pull the upset this year?

Cerozz,1609684502.0,kpll3w,4.0,1.0,"**General thoughts**

&gt; ""There was a good response today and I felt we started the right way by being aggressive. Crotone pushed seven players up and surprised us on the corner,‚Äù Conte told Sky Sport Italia.

&gt; ""We did well to turn it around, then a na√Øve error on the penalty could‚Äôve sparked anxiety, but the lads instead did really well to stay focused, keep creating scoring opportunities and bring home another victory.""

**Lukaku's injury**

""Romelu felt a slight muscular problem in his quadricep, we‚Äôll see if he is at risk against Sampdoria or not. As soon as he felt that twinge, we immediately substituted him, so hopefully it‚Äôs nothing serious.""

**Vidal's performance**

""He can improve a great deal. He certainly needs to work, keep his head down and work hard, because nobody has a guaranteed place in this team. He has to prove he deserves to play and do much better than he is doing at the moment.""

*It was pointed out that his face suggested Conte would happily slap Vidal at this moment and the coach smiled.*

""When I say he has to do much better, I am referring to the too many ups and downs, which we as Inter cannot afford. He knows that, he knows he has to get back to training harder, because playing for big clubs you can sometimes use training for back-heel flicks and fun, but that‚Äôs not the case here.""

**Sensi's return and Hakimi's contribution**

""We‚Äôre glad Stefano Sensi is back, because we basically only had him for seven games last season. We have Roberto Gagliardini, who is a guarantee when he comes on, so we‚Äôre happy. We have alternatives and must try to keep improving.""

""In the second half, aside from Achraf Hakimi, it was basically the same line-up as last season. Hakimi is improving a great deal in his defending, as he arrived at Inter only focusing on attack, but we explained the importance of the wing-backs when defending.""

""He deserves credit for really knuckling down and can provide guarantees in defence too now.""",FCInterMilan,"Conte's post-match interview: Lukaku's injury, slamming Vidal for his performance, Sensi's return and Hakimi's contribution.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/kpll3w/contes_postmatch_interview_lukakus_injury/,2021-01-03 22:35:02
SurvivingC,1609683866.0,kplfcw,10.0,1.0,"Why all the hate?

The entire season, people have been bashing Conte and being critical of him for every single decision he makes.  He is getting the most out of the players given to him by management and has Inter contending in the league every season.

Controversial Players 

This season management told Conte there is no money and so he could only bring in old players past their prime that cost next to nothing so he had to settle for Kolarov and Vidal.  People bashed Conte for playing Kolarov at the beginning of the season on D even when Skriniar (Spurs), De Vrij and Godin (was sold) were out because the club wanted to sell them.  This management (not Conte) decision cost Inter points.  When Vidal came in for next to nothing, everyone on this board was happy because he was a player who started on Barcelona.  But there's a reason he came for next to nothing and Conte tried to work with what was available. Which brings us to Gagliardini who Conte starts on occasion.  Gagliardini started playing more when Sensi, who was phenomenal at the beginning of last season and got Inter off to an amazing start, got injured.  Conte had to play the next best player and that's Gagliardini.  Sure he will miss sitters, but he is a work horse with size and plays well defensively.  He's been a key reason why Inter has won so many games (Conte only has so many CMs and Gagliardini was already on the roster when Conte got here).  Lastly Eriksen who the club forced on Conte... why the love for this player over Conte?  Eriksen is always on his own and doesn't interact with the other players, he doesn't fit with the team on or off the field while Conte on the other hand, the players like.  Conte will treat the players that have bought into the family system very well.  I just don't get all the Eriksen love?!?  He has never shown heart on the field or to other players or to the club.

Players (Team favorites)

Lukaku/Sanchez/Young were playing relatively poor for what was expected of them at Man U but when you give Conte money to go out and spend and get the players that fit into his system, he get Lukaku and turns him from zero to hero.  Conte was also given money to get Hakimi... when Conte is able to get his players, this team thrives.  Conte also wanted to get Kante for Chelsea who would be another Barella workhorse who is currently being under utilized at Chelsea (same was Lukaku wasn't used correctly at Man U).  Conte can coach with the right players.

Champions League / Serie A / Premier League

When Conte was hired, you knew he was going to underperform in the Champions League.  Look at this track record... it is awful.  But when it comes to the regular season (Serie A / Premier League), there's no one better in the business and the results from last season and this season show it.  That's why he was hired.  Inter hasn't been this competitive in 10 years.  Also, getting to the Europa League final isn't too shabby.

Conte Potentially Leaving

The hate for Conte really accelerated last season when he started talking to the media at the end of the season for not getting support from management.  He and the players were continuously being attacked by the media and instead of Inter fans supporting him, you let the media sway you into hating him too... the players like Conte and you should be behind the players and not the manipulated media.  And how would you react when a bullet is mailed to you and the club doesn't tell only to find out later than your wife and daughter late know that their husband/father is being threatened to die for coaching soccer.  Personally, I would have ripped management even more.  This year Conte has been quiet because management has supported him and had his back.  This could have been all avoided if they had his back last year.

Salary

The discussion of Conte making $8M a year more than the next coach is a mute point.  That's pocket change when looking at the bigger picture.  A lot of players make more than Conte but a manager has a much bigger impact than a single player.  If a player or system isn't being utilized correctly, it doesn't matter how good the player is, the team will lose (look at Barcelona right now or Lukaku when he was at Man U).  A player makes a position better while a coach makes the entire team better.  Conte deserves every penny.

If/when Conte leaves and part of it has to do with the fans hating him, you the fans will feel it and not him.  We are lucky to currently have such a great manager because others won't be getting this much out of the team.  A lot of you are currently spoiled and if/when he leaves, there will be a drop off and you will regret not enjoying the time Conte managed this team and was competing for a title every season (just remember the last 10 season before he got here).

Williams is still operating despite handing his resignation as Inter‚Äôs CFO in January.

Today, he spoke to investors for Inter Media and Communications and his statement were reported by Calcio e Finanza.

&gt; ""Like many other clubs, both in Italy and across Europe, we have reached agreements with some counterparts to postpone payments as part of efforts to manage our working capital,‚Äù Williams said.

&gt; ‚ÄúHowever, I repeat, it all happened with the full consent of all parties involved,‚Äù he continued.

The club‚Äôs CFO confirmed Suning is in talks to get financial aid or sell a majority stake in the club.

&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough Suning has confirmed its commitment to financially support the club, with or without additional an external support, it is also reasonable and prudent to look outward,‚Äù Williams claimed.

&gt; ‚ÄúWith this in mind, Suning has appointed key consultants in Asia to work with them to find suitable partners, whether it‚Äôs an equity injection or something else.  Discussions with the main potential partners in this respect are ongoing.

&gt; ‚ÄúWith the significant challenges faced this year, Inter remain in a strong position to fight for the title this year, and off the field, the club and our property have taken significant steps to ensure the future of the club.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe are still playing behind closed doors and, like many top European clubs, we continue to face the continuing challenges due to the COVID pandemic.

&gt; ‚ÄúAt this stage, we cannot say when fans will return to stadiums, but we hope that the end of this difficult period is not too far away.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe closures of stadiums have had a clear impact on the loss of ticket revenues which could affect big clubs more than small clubs.

&gt; ""The impact of the pandemic is also seen in the depression of the entire economic sector.

&gt; ‚ÄúWhen normally we could take the opportunity to reduce the wage bill and generate additional money through the sale of players, this year the situation has made it all more difficult.

5kyLegend,1614002494.0,lpoop0,21.0,1.0,"We've gone through a couple very rough patches with Conte, the most recent one being his weird experimentation of a much more risky, offensive-focused playstyle that honestly just didn't work for us. \#ConteOut has ended up on trending lists way more than just a couple times, and the entire ""Eriksen situation"" only ended up breaking apart Inter fans altogether. But, now that we've been going through a positive moment, I feel like we can take a step back and look at some actual things Conte accomplished that, in my opinion, not many other coaches could have ever done, especially since we never had a ""Premier League-like budget"" to spend in transfers.

I'm talking about player development, something that ended up getting Conte loads of criticism in the past, too, because he wouldn't play the starters fans wanted to see, or that made some people puzzled regarding some decisions on our players. And yet, if things keep going the way they are, Conte would end up proving everyone that he **definitely** knows what he's doing, and that he absolutely deserves the fat paycheck he's getting. Let me go a bit more in depth regarding some specific cases, starting from our defense and going till our attack.

***Bastoni***, who nowadays is probably one of the best young CBs there are in Serie A, was an absolute nobody to most fans before Conte. He was mostly seen as an overpaid defender we'd probably loan out here or there, but who wouldn't really do too well with us. A huge risk we'd sell to someone else in the future, while everyone praised Juve for the *masterclass* in getting the young, promising De Ligt for only ‚Ç¨85.5M. This has been explicitly said, but Conte stepped down and told our management to ***NOT*** loan out Bastoni, despite half of Serie A asking us for it. And despite his very shaky starts, the guy now belongs to a 3ATB defense, especially for his offensive contributions with his runs that remind me of Lucio's. He's probably one of the biggest examples of growth in our team, growth that any other manager wouldn't have brought, asking for an ‚Ç¨80M CB instead.

And then we have ***Skriniar***. The way he didn't play as much last year gained Conte immense criticism, and yet it was quite clear that not only did he not really resonate with a 3ATB defense, but that mentally he was very weak, making constant mistakes and being anything but decisive. As much as I wanted to defend him because his heart IS black and blue, he really didn't perform well last season. Then, transfer rumors began, and even more people (even to this day!) were shitting on Conte for ""wanting to sell Skriniar"" (despite it being management who wanted to try and sell him, while Skriniar himself [confirmed that Conte asked him to stay](https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/il92ve/skriniar_me_leaving_inter_i_still_have_three/)). And yet this year, dare I say, Skriniar not only came out with a **completely** different mentality (being confident and sure of himself), but tactically he's been **nailing** a 3ATB defense, and now he's proven all the fans who thought ""Skriniar should only defend, he can't make offensive contributions"" wrong by literally taking Hakimi's place on the right wing at times, and even being the only one to dribble past our opponents sometimes! His growth has been absolutely insane.

Of course, there's ***De Vrij*** as well, but he really just found his place with Conte's tactics, rather than growing under him.

When it comes to our midfield, Conte has definitely improved ***Brozovic*** as of late. He doesn't flail his arms as much, he doesn't look ""scazzato"" as often as before, and more in general it feels like he's found an agreement with Conte's tactics, and because of that... For the last few matches, we've seen only the good side of Brozovic. The side that, in the past, we'd see one match every five. ***Hakimi*** too has improved defensively, and is still improving, becoming more and more of a complete RWB while he was more suitable to being a ""RW that plays defensively"" before. ***Perisic*** didn't think he could work as a LWB. He didn't think he could perform well since he lacked everything when it comes to defending, and positioning for that specific role. But - as Conte said in a recent interview - he decided to make himself available and to trust his coach. He has been putting a LOT of work during his matches lately, and would you look at that? Suddenly one of our worst players becomes one of the best simply because they bought into our coach's tactics, and is now working well with the rest of the team. This is another player who, during the last couple matches, has literally been reborn into another one, and I hope it continues.

And then, there's ***Eriksen***. Even mentioning the guy, on this sub, on social media or even to friends irl usually meant you were getting into a big discussion. And since I really don't want to start any fight here, so I won't go too in depth, but: he arrived because he was much cheaper than he should have been despite not fitting our system at all. We tried playing him as a pure trequartista, but that fucked our tactics so bad we only started performing well again once we went back to a normal 3-5-2 where Eriksen didn't fit. Conte and Eriksen had a rough time afterwards, and the guy was probably going to be sold... But because of Covid, we ended up keeping him since we wouldn't be able to sell him, only loan him out. And then... He made himself available to Conte. Conte started playing him to the left of Brozovic, and Eriksen started putting in a ***ton*** of work he wasn't really putting in before. He started accepting being more physical... And now he's improving, exponentially. He's been giving us amazing contributions with his fast plays, his amazing first touch, and his tactical vision which lets him see plays others would normally not see. And hopefully, this made him and Conte make up, because I truly believe that if Eriksen makes himself fully available to Conte, he can make him into a world class star again. Him and Perisic proved that Conte can and will accept you even if you'd normally not fit his system, but only if you make yourself available and buy into his tactics. Thank God they both seemingly have done this, because they've basically been reborn as of late.

***Lukaku*** was obviously the one pivotal player Conte needed. And it's safe to say, he always was a beast, but under Conte he's become a monster, improving in many ways and showing Man United what a proper coach can do with a player that has potential. ***Lautaro***, on the other hand, was almost made by Conte. His improvements last year were clearly visible match by match, and despite him having problems with consistency, even to this day, he has grown way, way more. Imagine thinking under Spalletti that Barca would be interest in Lautaro, and for rather big sums of money too.

---

Wall of text? I'm aware. But I wanted to get this off my chest, since in my opinion - as long as things continue this way - there's no doubt in us having to keep Conte next year too. His record with Europe is not good at all, but seeing how much we can grow once we find some tactics to finally stick with and develop... I believe we can even do well there next year, as long as everyone puts in the work needed to do so. There's very few coaches that can improve players you already own like Conte has, and even though we've had our rough patches with him... I think lots of work he's put into the team has gone for granted, while it really shouldn't be.

I also didn't mention this since it should go unsaid, but... Of course, the players get as much praise as Conte does, for making themselves available to the coach and **working hard** to improve and fit into our system. I'm really happy to see where our team is right now, and how we've been growing.",FCInterMilan,[Long Post] A lot of work Conte has put in developing our players tends to go unnoticed.

&gt; ‚ÄúMy players deserve the praise, it was a well-prepared game, they were the absolute protagonists on the pitch,‚Äù Conte told DAZN.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt was a nice game, it was a derby with a lot of pressure because both teams are up there in the table.

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy because we prepared the game well. We were good to make the most of the opportunities against a strong team,‚Äù the coach continued.

&gt; ‚ÄúMilan and Pioli deserve the praise for what they‚Äôve done, we want to dedicate the win to our fans, their welcome at the stadium gave us goosebumps and even more responsibility.‚Äù

Are Inter the Scudetto favourite now?

&gt; ‚ÄúI fear the next two games against Genoa and Parma. That‚Äôs when we must prove we have done a further step to remain on top of the Serie A table,‚Äù Conte claimed.

&gt; ‚ÄúGenoa have only lost one game since Ballardini arrived. Parma are struggling despite having a good team, these two games will tell us a lot about what we can achieve.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe always study how our opponents‚Äô defend in order to enhance the qualities of our players.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt always depends on the characteristics of our opponents. Today we tried to press high on the pitch with Hakimi and Perisic when we had a chance.

&gt; ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the season we were always pressing high up the pitch and sometimes we suffered it, now we are handling these situations much better.

&gt; ‚ÄúSelf-esteem increases when you beat direct rivals. Today‚Äôs win confirmed we are improving, we must continue this path, good results are helping us and it‚Äôs easier for me to make players understand my ideas.‚Äù

How does he explain the development of Eriksen and Ivan Perisic?

&gt; ‚ÄúI believe a coach must improve everyone and let them understand his ideas. We are a team and we have clear ideas on both phases.

&gt; ‚ÄúPerisic‚Äôs and Eriksen‚Äôs improvements make me proud. Barella arrived at Inter and settled in well immediately. Other players need more time, Eriksen needed time too. He has understood our ideas and the same is true of Perisic.

&gt; ‚ÄúLast year Perisic didn‚Äôt have the same commitment, he‚Äôs changed now and today he played a very good game under every aspect. He has an incredible potential and sometimes he should believe more in himself.

That's how we discovered Rannochia, Santon, Balotelli etc.

But Conte is not thinking about the future of Inter at all. He's not promoting any young Inter players. He's always playing his trusted 11-12 players.

Second keeper would always play the coppa italia. Even Milan and Juve played the second keeper resting the first one.

There is a lot of talk about Cragno and Musso in this context, but one thing surprises me. Why is nobody talking about DrƒÖgowski? Looking at his performance and statistics, you can see that he is one of the most promising goalkeepers in Serie A. Additionally, he is (so far) relatively cheap.

Sicilian_Wiseguy,1612126587.0,l9lsls,106.0,6.0,"Ciao fellow Interisti,

I don‚Äôt comment a lot on Reddit, but I wanted some clarification on something. I am half Italian born in the Netherlands, nearby Amsterdam. I study a master‚Äôs degree accountancy, so financial terms are familiar to me.

Yesterday I watched Inter on the Dutch sports channel Ziggo Sport. And Dutch commentators are known to be crazy biased. The guy who commentates Italian football in the Netherlands is called Emile Schelvis and he is a massive fan of Ronaldo and Ibra. Anyways, yesterday he was repeatedly mentioning how Inter is troubled with financial problems. He was even making fun of us saying that ‚Äúof course the players will not play good, if they don‚Äôt get paid haha‚Äù. He said that when Skriniar and Vidal couldn‚Äôt clear the ball, until Skriniar took control again.

However, I think this critique is unfair. As Juve didn‚Äôt pay their players last year, same for Barca. I think he is just putting Inter‚Äôs problems under a magnifying glass. What do you guys think? Are our problems really exceptionally worse (maybe the worst)? Or is this the usual media downplaying Inter.

For more context, he was saying that Milan played better for the most part in the Coppa. And that the red card ruined everything for Milan. He also mentioned a stat that said that Milan finish their chances better than Inter (which may be true, due to Lautaro). He also said that Benevento just played bad, and Inter capitalized on that. Overall, very negative commentator when Inter plays.

Just curious to hear your opinion about it. And maybe someone can explain more about the financial aspect, compared to other clubs in Europe.

Aygor,1615911565.0,m6csa5,41.0,1.0,"With 11 games to go, I figured it is a decent time to have a look at our schedule and compare it to that of our rivals.

Table as of matchday 27:

Team| Played| W| D| L| GF| GA| GD| Points| Max| Elo
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Inter| 27| 20| 5| 2| 65| 26| +39| 65| 98| 1892
Milan| 27| 17| 5| 5| 50| 31| +19| 56| 89|1778
Juve| 26| 16| 7| 3| 54| 22| +32| 55| 91|1863
Atalanta| 27| 15| 7| 5| 63| 34| +29| 52| 85|1827
Napoli| 26| 16| 2| 8| 56| 29| +27| 50| 86|1759
Roma| 27| 15| 5| 7| 51| 40| +11| 50| 83|1772

While Juventus is one game behind, and could potentially leapfrog Milan at 58 points, our lead is currently a minimum of +7 on second place.

It is unrealistic to think any team will go on winning all remaining games, but it is useful to keep the roof our rivals can reach in mind.
This means finishing the season 9-0-2 (92), or 9-1-1 (93) would make it impossible for either to catch up. Easier said than done of course.

Let's have a look at our schedule:


Matchday| Home| Away| Opp. Elo
---|---|----|----
28| *Inter*| Sassuolo| 1650
29| Bologna| *Inter*| 1609
30| *Inter*| Cagliari| 1562
31| **Napoli**| *Inter*| **1759**
32| Spezia| *Inter*| 1515
33| *Inter*| Verona| 1612
34| Crotone| *Inter*| 1482
35| *Inter*| Samp| 1606
36| *Inter*| **Roma**| **1772**
37| **Juve**| *Inter*| **1863**
38| *Inter*| Udinese| 1625

We have 3 big matches left (and Sassuolo), 2 are away (Napoli, Juve). In particular, we will play 2 big matches in the third and second to last game, and it is easy to see how decisive the Derby d'Italia may be this year. 


Milan:

Matchday| Home| Away| Opp. Elo
---|---|----|----
28| Fiorentina| *Milan*| 1624
29| *Milan*| Sampdoria| 1606
30| Parma| *Milan*| 1542
31|*Milan*| Genoa| 1586
32| *Milan*| Sassuolo| 1650
33| **Lazio**| *Milan*| **1749**
34| *Milan*| Benevento| 1535
35| **Juve**| *Milan*| **1863**
36| Torino| *Milan*| 1575
37| Milan| Cagliari| 1562
38| **Atalanta**| *Milan*| **1827**

Milan has 3 big matches ahead, like us, but all of them are away. Atalanta as their last game may be especially tough, depending on the fight for the last CL spot. Lastly, they will play against Juve, to our direct benefit.


Juve:

Matchday| Home| Away| Opp. Elo
---|---|----|----
27| *Juve*| Benevento| 1535
28| **Torino**| *Juve*| **1575**
29| *Juve*| **Napoli**| **1759**
30| *Juve*| Genoa| 1586
31| **Atalanta**| *Juve*| **1827**
32| *Juve*| Parma| 1542
33| Fiorentina| *Juve*| 1624
34| Udinese| *Juve*| 1625
35| *Juve*| **Milan**| **1778**
36| Sassuolo| *Juve*| 1650
37| **Inter**| *Juve*| **1892**
38| Bologna| *Juve*| 1609

Leaving aside the Turin Derby (In its current Serie A spell, starting in 2012-13, Torino only won once -in 2015- and drew twice), Juve still has to face the other 4 top 5 teams, the Derby d'Italia being the second to last game of the season.

The current average elo rating of our opponents is 1641, 1647 for Milan and 1668 for Juve. While the difficulties are comparable, our road ahead currently appears less difficult than that of Juventus, which reflects their 4 big matches.


What would happen if we end the season with equal points against Milan or Juve?


Team| Home| Away| Aggregate
---|---|----|----
Milan| **1**-2| **3**-0| **3**-2
Juve| **2**-0| tbd| tbd

In Serie A tiebreakers look at points in direct matches, goal difference, away goals, total goals scored, goal difference, coin toss.

We already played both games against Milan, and we are ahead.
Juve was scoreless against us, which works in our favour. To win the tiebreaker, they need to beat us 3-0 in Turin. In case the match ends 2-0, Inter currently leads in total goals scored 65 to 54.

Bonus:

Team| Played| W| D| L| GF| GA| GD| Points| Max
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Inter| 3| 2| 0| 1| 6| 2| +4| 6| 9
Juve| 2| 1| 0| 1| 3| 3| 0| 3| 9
Milan| 3| 1| 0| 2| 3| 7| -4| 3| 6

Funnily, if the three all finish with the same points, Milan has a chance to clinch the result. For instance, if Juve edges us 1-0 and they beat Juve 8-0.

Id like to see us offloading pinamonti and maybe getting in another solid experienced striker, for goalkeepers I would say keep padelli as the 3rd choice ,sign Handanovic to another year contract loan out radu and maybe sign Juan Musso and let him learn under handanovic for a year before he takes the starting job (play a few matches aswell)  and even for Stankovic the primavera goalkeeper should be loaned out to maybe a serie B club.

juvedeservesnothing,1615487696.0,m2xac3,70.0,1.0,"I hope Inter Milan wins the scudetto this season and continues to dominate Italy for years to come. I hope Juventus never wins a single trophy ever again. 

They are some of the most ungrateful and arrogant fans I have ever seen. When Ronaldo joined them I wished them the best since I wanted him to win everything with them. The way their fanbase has treated him over the past couple of months and especially after the recent defeat in Europe just confirmed to me they deserve absolutely nothing. The way Ronaldo has become a scapegoat for absolutely everything is just laughable.

The truth is, I didn't even know what/who ""Juventus"" was until the 2017 CL final against Madrid lol. But I knew who AC Milan and Inter Milan were. Two true powerhouses with phenomenal histories.

I remember watching that Inter Milan - Barcelona game in 2010 when I was a child. I remember that brilliant Julio Cesar finger tip save against Lionel Messi's shot. I remember Mourinho's iconic celebration infront of the fans. It was one of my first memorable football experiences. I fell in love with the blue and black kit. 

I started watching serie A when Ronaldo joined and researched more about this club. I remembered that moment in 2010 and understood more about this great club. The juve subreddit makes this club seem like some pathetic small team despite the fact that Juventus themselves haven't won a single champions League in this century lol (25 years I think). Browsing that subreddit just made me realise what a bunch of delusional, ungrateful, arrogant and despicable fans they truly are. Everyone is conveniently ignoring the numerous other problems they have and they are just pinning all the blame on Ronaldo. 

I really really hope he leaves that club and it's disgraceful fanbase in the summer.

I hope Inter Milan (my fav Italian team) wins everything from now on. You guys are definitely going to win the CL before Juventus ever does lol.

FORZA INTER!

vik1980,1615376760.0,m1vqj7,28.0,1.0,"Serie A title is now practically ours, and, thanks to the virus, I have a lot of free time on my hands. I also do believe this coming summer will see quite a lot of turn over in our playing personnel. As such, I thought I'd do a 'Squad Status' for our team, with potential targets for next season.

**Untouchables** :- (Lukaku, De Vrij, Bastoni, Barella, Lautaro, Hakimi) These are players that aren't going anywhere this summer, no matter what the offer. 

**Most definitely staying** :- (Skriniar, Eriksen, Brozovic) These names will stay barring an obnoxious offer. I only include them in this list because the club was open to selling them previously, and given the financial cloud over our (and current owners) heads, we're not in a position to turn down 60+m offers for them. 

**Soldiers** :- (Perisic, Gagliardini, Sensi, Darmian, Sanchez) As such, they still have value, but they're expendable. They could end up staying, but they could also be packaged to get better players, or simply get sold. 

**Expendable** :- (Mario, Dalbert, Vecino, Lazaro) They don't have a future with us. We need someone to present an acceptable offer for them. That's it. 

**Gone** :- (Young, Kolarov, Vidal, Nainggolan, Padelli, Ranocchia) Far too old for bringing any real value in return, and not useful enough to command a squad spot, they'll end up leaving. 

**Young Assets** :- (Pinamonti, Radu, Colidio, Di Gregorio, Mulattieri, Gravillon,) If not now, in the long run, they'll end up as pawns or plusvalenza. i.e.- Assets to be moved for a better player from a smaller club, or book profits.

**Gems** :- (Pirola, Esposito, Agoume, Salcedo, Stankovic, Vagiannidis, Males) Far too young to give up on, &amp; we still believe in their future. They'll only go on loan. 


--

Potential replacements &amp; Targets (with possibility rating)

Maksimovic (Napoli) - Free transfer with wage demand (2.5m/ yr.) in line. Replacment for Rano. (7/10 - we've supposedly reached an agreement already)

De Paul - Hard worker who can dribble, pass or shoot, in addition of playing in a number different positions and tactical set-ups. (7/10 - good chance he comes, only problem being his price)

Musso - Supposedly, our only real target to replace Handa. The other names (Rui Silva, Meret, Cragno etc.) are just smokescreen. (8/10 - same as De Paul)

Damsgaard - flexible attacker/ AM who idolises Eriksen. Floated price of 20m. (6/10 - depending on what Ju**B**e offer, and whether Samp like our young players more, we might get him).

Wijnaldum - All action mid who just turned 30. Conte yearns for him. (6/10- wants 10m/yr. 10m bonus- will go to whichever team matches those demands)

Gaich - Tall young (22) forwards who recently moved on loan to Benevento (who have an option for him). I've seen him in junior WC and he reminded me of Jeko. (6.5/10 - I can see us moving for him and, possibly, using Pinamonti to lure Benevento).

Koopmeiners - Flexible, tall, young (23) left footed mid who can cover multiple positions (CB, DM, CM) &amp; play many set-ups (3 mid, double pivot, holding mid) too. [Advance stats love him.](https://breakingthelines.com/scouting-report/the-best-u-21-defensive-midfielders-in-eredivisie/) (6.5/10 - I could see this happening.)

Milenkovic - We need cover at CB's. He'll be in the last year of his contract next season. If others (PL, Milan) don't jump in, we'll go after him. (5.5/10 - We were very interested, but Skriniar's current form, and our financial woes, and interest in him means we might not get him).

Kaio Jorge - We've always been interested in him. He's off contract in December. We'll definitely attempt to get him to sign a pre-contract with us this summer. (X/10 - As long as we make him feel that we believe in him, he'll come. If he feels it's not the time to move to Europe, he won't).

Mandi/ Mustafi/ N'Koulou - All CB's, all off-contract this summer. Like I said, we need CB covers. (6/10 - We'll get more reinforcement here. Whether it's one of these guys or someone else is up for debate).


--

**Ownership**

I think we'll get sold to BC Partners. The PIF and others are just smokescreen. Supposedly (so I've read), Suning invested in Evergrande at the behest of CCP, and it's hurt them financially (along with the virus). This theory is further substantiated by them not option to enforce a legal demand for their investment from Evergrande (they could've, but chose not to). Subsequently, they sold a small fraction (10-15%) of their website business to the CCP for billions. And the CCP as laid out a directive to kill all footballing investment. As such, Suning will follow, as stated by their owner (Zhang Sr.) on video. Rest (loans, smaller ownership sale etc.) is just smokescreen. The only real offer they have is from BC Partners.

As such, I really do think our cycle is now beginning. We'll tweak the squad irrespective of what happens to the ownership. Also, given Ju**B**e's current status (in shambles), it should be a long and dominant cycle too.",FCInterMilan,Squad Status for next season (and potential summer tweaks),0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/m1vqj7/squad_status_for_next_season_and_potential_summer/,2021-03-10 19:46:00

Any of you guys play Football Manager? I find it quite interesting to think of great players and how they would look in their absolute prime on the most recent edition of the FM series. Even if you don't play Football Manager but know lots about Lothar Matthaus then your input would be appreciated as well

I could go back to the old championship manager games to see what his stats were back in those days. But his prime was surely before the first game was released, and even if it wasn't; the stats have changed so much over time.

Anyway if any of you have lots of free time in quarantine and fancy doing some listing, I would be fascinated to read your input. Presumably his prime would be as a box to box rather than when he was older, moving deeper.

&gt; According to the leaked contracts in Der Spiegel, Juventus would‚Äôve earned more than double the sum given to Milan and Inter in the Super League.

&gt; The project is now practically dead in the water, but the details are still emerging about what the deal would‚Äôve entailed.

&gt; Much has been said about the up to ‚Ç¨350m guaranteed on entry to the Super League for the founding clubs, but it seems there are some very big discrepancies between how much each side would receive.

&gt; Juventus would be either in the second or third tier, earning them ‚Ç¨225-300m on entry.

&gt; That is still less than top tier clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona, who‚Äôd receive ‚Ç¨350m.

&gt; There is a very big gap then to the lowest tier clubs, including Inter, Milan, Atletico Madrid and eventually Borussia Dortmund, who would pick up just ‚Ç¨100m.

&gt; The disparity would continue on the money to be passed out between the clubs after the tournament had concluded.

&gt; Sporting results would count for only 20 per cent of the division of revenue, with the club‚Äôs name guaranteeing them far more.

&gt; La Gazzetta dello Sport claim this would mean a club could earn from a minimum of ‚Ç¨55m to a maximum of ‚Ç¨270m.",FCInterMilan,Super League leaks show that Juventus would receive more than double that of Milan or Inter.

**Spezia game**

Antonio Conte was pleased with Inter‚Äôs performance in the 1-1 draw with Spezia, but while he calls for ‚Äòmeritocracy‚Äô after the Super League fiasco, he also urges UEFA to ‚Äòreflect‚Äô on sharing resources better.

After 11 consecutive victories, this was their second consecutive 1-1 draw, again with a costly Samir Handanovic error. They nonetheless extend their lead at the top to 10 points, as Milan lost to Sassuolo earlier today.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe pressure is inevitable, as let‚Äôs not forget that many players are challenging for something important for the first time. They are doing it very well and I think we could easily have deserved the win,‚Äù Conte told Sky Sport Italia.

&gt; ‚ÄúI was happy with the intensity of the performance, though we could‚Äôve had more quality in the final third, which is why we‚Äôre talking about a draw rather than a win.

&gt; ‚ÄúI saw a lot right and we tried to the end for a winning goal. I am above all pleased with the performance. Inevitably, there are fewer rounds left, we can see the finish line, and the pressure is taking its toll.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe used up a lot of energy tonight and have another physical game coming up against Verona. We had just one day to work on preparation, as after Napoli we got home on Monday. The whole group prepared the game yesterday.‚Äù

**Superleague**

The last three days have been dominated by the chaos of 12 clubs, including Inter, announcing they would set up a breakaway Super League, then scrapping it 48 hours later.

&gt; ‚ÄúInevitably, we also heard all this news that was coming in. As a man of sport, I think we must never forget tradition. This is history and it should be respected,‚Äù noted Conte.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe must never forget the passion for sport and, certainly not least, sport must be meritocratic. We work to win and to earn something. Meritocracy must always be first and foremost.

&gt; ‚ÄúHaving said that, everything which happened shows it‚Äôs only right that UEFA reflect too. They organise tournaments, take all the rights and reserve only a minimal part of that for the teams who are actually taking part in these tournaments.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe players are squeezed like lemons with this packed fixture list and get very little for it. So the organisations need to consider a more congruous remuneration, because clubs invest in coaches and players, so they deserve some of the revenue that they help to generate.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf you get 10 from rights and keep seven of it for yourself, giving out just three to everybody else, that‚Äôs not really fair. I think the split needs to be reconsidered.‚Äù

The new Champions League format will have even more games, as it‚Äôll be two groups of 10 playing home and away.

&gt; ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really reflected on the format. It doesn‚Äôt matter who many are in there, the important thing is that there is meritocracy, otherwise sport loses its meaning. Meritocracy is the most important thing, but also the organisations including those who run the international fixtures need to consider spreading out the resources a little better.‚Äù

I mean they are going to keep the same midweek format and knockout bracket as the Champions League after the league play. If people are worried about the smaller teams being excluded, I think they should maybe include a promotion/relegation system in where teams that perform at the top levels in their country could play in the super league the next season, bumping out the teams that do poorly. Is it because of a potential wealth gap between the top and bottom teams? I mean a team other than Milan, Juve, or Inter hasn‚Äôt won‚Äôt the scudetto in 20 years so that gap has already existed imo. Also, UEFA and FIFA have been corrupt for years, and financial relief would be great after FIFA fucked us for the last decade with FFP.

I'm sorry, but everyone saying ""Zhang is spitting on our history"" simply does not know how the world goes on.

I'm the first to hate this competition, it's unfair and restricted to just 5 teams ""qualified"" and all other teams are always invited, but that's not Steven's fault, neither is Steven disrespecting our history.

It is simply something **too big** to stay out of.  If this League doesn't exist, no one gives a fuck, but if it exists, us, as Inter, can't stay out of it; it would simply be stupid to reject the income it is granting, period.

Also: given that fans complaints will be worth nothing, stop whining about ""I will stop supporting the Team"" or ""Everyone stop being a member or buying the merchandise"".  You can do what you want, but do not influence other people by DAMAGING the Team.

There is no **fault** in what Steven did, he simply aligned to the times that are going on.  Big Teams are carrying the football since 2000s and if he owns a football Teams I guess he will be way more acknowledged on what to do and why.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, we did not win a trophy due to referees' bribery as some other team did, there is no reason to say ""we aren't legal"" or ""we need to be excluded by the A league"".  If you want to stop supporting the team, go on, do what you like, but then don't try to teach the lesson on how to support the Team.  The Team is supported when it's 1st and when it's 14th in the League, when it hires a top player and when it hires a coach you don't like (no one was booing when Conte signed, saying that he was an infiltrator, right? :-) ) otherwise you are only occasionali (casual fans).",FCInterMilan,"90% of negative comments about ""Suning's fault"" on the Superleague are dumb",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/muqyg0/90_of_negative_comments_about_sunings_fault_on/,2021-04-20 22:00:20

There are numerous reasons why such a competition goes against the very principles under which this club was founded - inclusivity and meritocracy. 

The more I thought about it, there was something else that was vexing me, and it revolved around a stat that is unique to Inter in Serie A. As an Inter fan, I am proud of the fact that Inter is the only club never to be relegated from Serie A, something we often use to poke in the face of you know who and who. However, there is a reason why we are all proud of this record - it is because we can and could relegated in any normal season, and so staying up was an actual achievement. Fast forward to this so called ""Super"" league, and that is completely lost as there is no penalty for finishing in the bottom 5 vs. bottom 3. I know that sounds great to the bean counters, but us fans like a fair fight where a bad season means my club has the same chance of going down as someone else.

I was born in a city in the United States with a predominantly Hispanic/Latin American population. I, a Chilean-American, remember the days of my father speaking on the greatness of the sport and my support for Chilean and other Latin American players was a way for me, and I assume many other children of immigrants, to feel connected to my father and our culture. Images of the 94 and 98 World Cup spring to mind. Stories of the Chilean National Team's infamous ban from the World Cup and our redemption in 98 where, although we were never favorites to progress, we fielded two hero's of the game, Marcelo Salas and Ivan Zamorano.

This is what led me to Serie A. Funny enough my family is of Italian decent, just outside of Milan in fact. What a happy coincidence that the captain of the Chilean National Team was playing alongside the greatest forward to have ever lived (fight me on this I dare you) in a region of Italy from where half of my family originated. 

Support for Inter was important to me, not because its my local team, but because it was bound with my cultural identity.

danithaca,1618842367.0,mu1rc0,18.0,1.0,"I think people are overracting to the super league news. Here's why:

1. They just announced the founding of this league. No concrete starting date or anything. I'd say everything is still up to negotiate at this point. Serie A or UEFA won't punish us simply because we are one of the 12 founders -- that'll further push us away and make things worse.
2. I believe Zhang made the right choice. If this whole thing doesn't work out, the other 11 clubs might potentially call it off because they are not stupid. If this thing does work, we'll be missing a huge opportunity not to be part of it. 
3. Ultimately these 12 clubs just want to make more money. I don't blame them since they are also the ones paying the most. If this thing back fires to the point where teams are banned from national leagues and players are banned from World Cup and fans alienated, I don't think they'll still push it forward that'll hurt their own interest.

Looking at our fixtures the difficult games are Napoli ,Roma and Juventus ,we can be in a position where we dont even have to care about this games ,this is why the next game is fundamental.
I am super excited about Wednesday ,i know this team can do it ,dai ragazzi :))

ArminbanVuuren,1622295587.0,nnnou5,17.0,1.0,"I understand we have just won the league, that is great. This is after our coach of 2 years has finally got his system in place for the last 2/3 of the season. And after our players have all cohesively been at their best (remember nearly selling skriniar and eriksen for nickels on the dollar?  Now they were both very valid parts in our title run)

It has taken us a while to get shit together. Let‚Äôs not forget how absolutely pathetic it was to get FOURTH out of our group for CL. That is absolutely embarrassing, and I will say that is at least partially responsible for our title win - most other Italian sides near the top of the table had significantly more squad rotation to deal with. My point is - it isn‚Äôt like we‚Äôre some ‚ÄúBayern in the Bundes‚Äù type side that can sell off players and have replacements step in with little let off. 

The fact that our board thinks we can sell off top players like Lukaku and Hakimi and who knows who else, is embarrassing. Yes, ‚Äúcovid‚Äù I know. You know which other teams have to deal with covid? Every other fucking club in the world. And most of them aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlucky‚Äù enough to have Chinese money backing them. 

I guess at the end of the day it is sad to see this club treated truly like a bottom line business. And I know that‚Äôs all a club is, a marketing brand and a business, but it is frustrating to watch when other clubs are trying to chase titles and competitive squads for Europe year after year, and here we are using our first title win in over a decade to ‚Äúsell our players high‚Äù instead of focusing on retaining/building the team so we don‚Äôt get absolutely fucking embarrassed in CL next year.

Now I‚Äôm very well aware that this won‚Äôt solve our economic chrisis because we still have to pay installments to United and Real but it will surely help, yesterday Bastoni was being rumored to be sold and he renewed, Skriniar said he‚Äôs not going anywhere, so you can expect similar things from other players.

If you're allegiance is to a player or coach rather than a team id be more than happy if you don't support. True Interisti are of the same mindset im sure.

And just so it wasn't clear, I don't propose these suggestions, just think pragmatically as to what the club will do next. Nothing is off the table now.

Now, with Conte having left, and Suning having all but confirmed that they can't invest in thesquad, what're our options now? 

Well, how about selling Lukaku, and replacing him with Vlahovic? We'll save wages, and get a nice surplus on top. Vlahovic is similar to Lukaku in play style, and Fiorentina might take counterparts 

If you didn't like that idea, is selling Lautaro and replacing him with Belotti more your cup of tea. 

Then there's Hakimi. Perfect wing-back, not perfect RB. If a club offers 60-70m for him, we'll need to consider. Replacements could be any one of Dodo (of Shaktar), Emerson (of Betis) or Pedro Porro.

De Vrij definitely has to be on the block. Now because he's bad, or because of his wages, but because at his age (29), it'll be the final time we get a legit offer for him. 

While I doubt we'll sell Bastoni or Barella (young, Italian, Conner stones for our next cycle), I could see our management pondering over Bastoni's sale, and replacing him with Senesi, or Badiashile etc. I doubt this would happen, though.

Whenever there's a disagreement between Conte and the management, the majority of fans always take Conte's side and demonize Suning saying things llike ""Conte is a winner, he wants to win but Suning are holding him and the club back"" are you serious ? fans forget that we are champions thanks to Suning and the management's work in the first place and then thanks to Conte, Suning got us out of the banter era, they have invested a shitload of money in Inter and thanks to their work, a manager like Conte wanted to work here.

Inter is by far the team who has done the most for Conte, more than Juve and more than Chelsea and he won't find a club that would accommodate every wish he has and be at his disposal like Inter, you'll see. And let's not forget that Inter put up with all his tantrums and outbursts and they always praise him while to me he never looked grateful or recognized the club's work and their support. His departure is not the club's fault, they have done everything to keep him, he is the one who refused to work with them.

And about the current situation, what's so terrible about selling a starter ? Juve have sold Pogba and Vidal and they sold Morata even who was pretty good at the time and you didn't see this reaction from them and they still went on to win more titles, the key is to reinvest the money in a smart way. How many big clubs in the world sell some of their players and yet they are still big and competitive, don't get me wrong I would still be very very very sad to see anyone of our starting eleven leave. 

I understand that the media is running away with this, even the foreign media, saying that Inter will sell half the squad and basically be dismantled by next season but come on we know better than to trust these rumors, let's just wait and see how the mercato goes and let's trust the ownership that has brought us this far but even more importantly let's trust the number 1 Beppe Marotta.

This will probably get lost in all the conte content (rip) but I figured we should look forward (though tbh I'm not really looking forward to it) to the future and see how some of the rumored candidates could lineup next season.  Btw forgive my formatting if it sucks lol

&amp;#x200B;

Inzaghi

We will have to sell, and that means (probably) lautaro gone, but if we can get big contracts off (Sanchez, vidal, kolarov, etc) we wont have to sell to many other big names.  Problem is, there arent many people who can replace a CF like him, and lazio want 70m for luis alberto. I haven't seen rumors, but I think Mattia Zaccagni could be an option behind lukaku in Inzaghi's 3511

\---------------------Lukaku--------------------

\-------------------Zaccagni-------------------

Dimarco-Eriksen-Brozo-Barella-Hakimi

\-----Bastoni---De Vrij----Skriniar--------

\--------------Handanovic------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Sarri

Same goes for Sarri, we must sell. We will also probably be switching to a 4-3-3 in that case, which means either moving Hakimi to winger, or possibly selling him in addition to lautaro. In Sarri's dreamworld we would buy Jorginho, but Tuchel loves him and I don't see him leaving. If we sell brozo, though, Locatelli could come in and take that role, and we might add De Paul if the fee isn't too high. I also haven't heard rumors, but with the need to cut wages if a decent offer for Eriksen comes in we should take it to cut wages. Bastoni is not a natural LB but he's left footed and I love our CBs. I think playing him there would allow hakimi to stay and play RB with more space to move forward as well and Basto can rotate with dimarco. We could also buy adama traore to play winger, and with two former wingbacks that work hard we would be covered on the right side.

Perisic----------Lukaku---------Traore

\-------De Paul--Locatelli--Barella-----

Bastoni--De Vrij--Skriniar--Hakimi

\---------------Handanovic--------------

&amp;#x200B;

Ranieri

He hasn't been mentioned in rumors, but if everything goes wrong and we go back into banter era I could see us bringing back Ranieri if for any reason just to have stability. And for this, lets just say Suning has given up, and we sell Lukaku, Lautaro, Eriksen, Brozovic and Skriniar because if they hired Ranieri it means they don't really care about our team anymore and are trying to recoup as much money before selling the team (which is honestly not out of the question). He plays a 4-4-2, and we could be looking at a younger (and cheaper) starting XI

\-------Pinamonti----Raspadori--------

Perisic---Sensi----Barella------Hakimi

Dimarco--Bastoni--De Vrij----Darmian

\----------------Handanovic------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Allegri

This almost for sure wont happen, since he is supposedly already negotiating with Juve (in addition to the fact that Conte left because we wont spend), but I figured id put it in anyway. Allegri likes a 4231, though he is pretty flexible. 

\--------------------Lukaku------------------

Perisic---------Eriksen----------Hakimi

\---------Brozo--------Barella------------

Dimarco-Bastoni-Skriniar-Darmian

\---------------Hananovic--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Eriksen could be brought back to his natural position and Alexis (If he stays) can be played more frequently. I think Lautaro would be very effective on a three prong attack.

The club manages to pay players and staff with its ‚Äúown‚Äù money while Zhang dips off in China. 

Months go by and the news are how Inter is in crisis, too much debt (like as if we were the only ones) as Zhang was looking to sell the club but decides to step back last minute, going for a 275m loan from Oaktree, to maintain control over Inter.

So my point is: You deny us of freedom, someone willing to invest on the club (who was free to, unlike Suning‚Äôs current situation), and im cool with it. Get a huge loan to pay off wages, previous transfer fees, running costs and other stuff but still have the guts to say ‚Äúwe need to sell 80m worth in players, reducing wage bill by 10-20% (which means getting rid deadwoods)‚Äù after the wonderful season done. Why did you get the loan for, to begin with? 

If the Zhang Family isn‚Äôt able to run Inter anymore, thinking about their own wealth before the club‚Äôs why haven‚Äôt they sold it, for god‚Äôs sake, when they had the chance to?

I‚Äôm sorry to take it on you guys, it‚Äôs been some stressful couple of hours. 

Even if we were to be sold to BC Partners or any other fund, they would‚Äôve sold some top players to capitalize instantly, unless we were sold to a Sheikh. But i‚Äôd rather see my club in hands of who can actually run a company than someone  incompetent, during the current circumstances.

What i‚Äôm really afraid of is getting back again to the banter era, after we got outta that shithole 4 years ago, after seeing the club finally lift a trophy.

I started watching Inter since later 2000s, when Inter won the championships regularly. However, as I grow up, Inter started to decline. Even though decline-and-rebuild cycle is normal for a team, a 10-year gap without any championships is too much for clubs like Inter. Many Inter fans could still remember the nightmares from our opponents like Gareth Bale, Ekdal, Kalinic, Higuain, etc. And we may never forget the target-missing long-range shots from Guarin, the terrible crosses from Jonathan and Nagatomo, the errors and mistakes from Juan Jesus. But in the meantime we also witnessed the backheel wonder of Palacio, the bicycle goal from Murillo, the header from Vecino, and many other wonderful moments. No one could ever imagine the days we will have Lukaku, Eriksen, Barella and Achraf in our squads when we could only line up the 36-old Rocchi, Kuzmanovic, Guarin and Jonathan on the same positions.

Speaking of this season, the first half was kind of a disappointment, when we drew against many opponents, got beaten by Bilan and failed to qualify from the group in Champions League. The turning point was the Coppa Italia match vs Milan. I remember that game so well because I watched it on my phone from ESPN after delivering PPEs from my workplace to local hospitals. The goal from Eriksen not only foreshadowed our success of the season, but also gave me the faith that we could eventually overcome the COVID pandemic and embrace the normal life like before.

I feel like Atletico and Inter is somewhat related. They're kind of the underdog these past decade, with modest, and incredible achievements. Atleti and Inter does not have any bad blood and their fanbase is pretty chill. Their team is always underrated by the mainstream football crowd and their defensive- counter-attacking play style is similar to Inter's. Obviously Cholo is their manager and he most likely will be Inter's manager in the future. A La Liga win would build up another layer to Cholo's winning mentality which would probably be great for Inter.

WalterSamuelEtoo,1621554357.0,nhewz0,25.0,1.0,"We need to continuously look at ways to improve the team. Conte would obviously has to tweek systems and likely players around. I want to focus in midfield area. What would you guys think of this idea? Is Brozovic untouchable and can we get a player who would improve our team instead?

Watching Brozovic under Conte, I feel is not a progressive player, his instincts is usually to play it safe, backwards or delay it unnecessarily. The ideal profile of player we should get to improve our midfield and general play is someone who can contribute more to the attacking aspect. Someone who can also speed up the play when we are playing teams that sit deep or hard to break down.

I've been looking at Lucatelli, who is younger with great potential and I think he would fit in perfectly along side Barella and Eriksen/Sensi. He's also energetic with great engine and wins the ball back. He has an eye got goal, more so than Brozovic although Brozo has more assist this season. 

So considering Brozovic is 28 years old, still at his peak and in theory should fetch good value. Cash we can use to reinvest where it won't be a downgrade but a buy on a player who is on the up and transform our tactics.",FCInterMilan,Would you rather we sell Brozovic and get someone like Locatelli instead?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/nhewz0/would_you_rather_we_sell_brozovic_and_get_someone/,2021-05-21 07:45:57

I was wondering if anyone here had any experience when it comes to autographs from players and could answer me a few questions.

  
1. Where would i have to send aE- Mail to? I tried to find anything on google or here on Reddit, but i couldn't really find a specific mail adress where i could ask for autographs or even just a post talking about that. Do they even offer that?

  
2. If they do send Autographs, does anyone know if they are hand-signed or printed onto the card?

did you get the memo? Apparently we are Champions of Italy after winning our 19th Scudetto! YAY!

We have seen celebrations everywhere, including [here](https://it.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/n37x6c/inter_are_champions_of_italy/)! But the best is yet to come, because r/FCInterMilan has another giant surprise waiting for you, a 1000‚Ç¨ (YES!) contest+lottery, which is made possible thanks to the generosity of u/Tranceh our friend and habitu√© of this community.

**What can I win?**

We are going to award a total of 15 gift cards (5x100‚Ç¨ and 10x50‚Ç¨) to be used on the [Inter Store](https://store.inter.it/). Get ready to grab some new Inter's gear to celebrate this fantastic season. In addition to this, there are 4 Reddit Platinum subscriptions waiting for you, for a grand total of 19 prizes (clever, eh?)

**How do I sign up for this?**

Well, it's very easy.

Leave a comment here. Tell us about your celebrations, about how you survived the banter decade, describe us the angry look on your rossoneri/bianconeri friends (we all have them, don't lie!). You know, tell us what this Scudetto means for you.

All kind of original content is accepted: text, pictures, videos, memes, audio...unleash your imagination!

**How are winners selected?**

We as Mod team (and u/Tranceh of course) are going to award five gift cards by selecting our favorite answers, while the rest of the winners are going to be randomly picked with a lottery. We believe this is the best way reward efforts while at the same time reduce bias and personal preferences.

**When are winners going to be announced?**

Subscriptions are open from now until the end of the season. After the match against Udinese, we are going to close this comment section. Until then, you will find this post pinned at the top of r/FCInterMilan. This gives all of you plenty of time to enter the contest/lottery, so start working on your answer and try to make it perfect!

**Are you sure we have actually won the Scudetto?**

We are reasonably sure to the point we want to celebrate with you, however we cannot rule out the possibility of all of us waking up to a Guar√≠n-Kuzmanoviƒá-Obi midfield. Sorry about that.


As you can see the rules are pretty simple. Let's see what you've got!

vik1980,1620388776.0,n6wtdt,21.0,1.0,"Harsh post, but required. 

Right now, I think the No. 1 Expendable Asset in the team is Eriksen. He's 29 yo, and on 7.5m wages. If we keep him another season, we might not get an offer for him. Since he only cost 20m last year, we stand to make a profit if we sell him this summer. 30m (Covid prices), and he could be replaced by a number of players. 

Next, I think De Vrij is another obvious asset. He's 29, and came for free. Another year and his value will tank (like Koulibaly). 40-50m and it's pure profit now. Keeping this in mind, despite his importance, Inter cannot rule out a sale. 

I think these two players can be let go, despite sentiments. The finances dictate that we be ruthless here. 

I think De Paul can easily replace Eriksen, who's had to push hard to fit in Conte's system, while De Paul would be a much more natural fit. 

As for De Vrij, I think we'll face some problems. Milenkovic is the easy answer. However, he's like Bastoni, in that he'd be perfect for the wide CB role, but DV plays the centre CB. Unless we train Skriniar to play the centre CB role, DV will still not be replaced. Personally, I would try and get Andersen, if we can afford him. Not sure if we can. Then, I also really, really* like Ibanez at Roma. I'd love to get him.",FCInterMilan,Expendable assets,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/n6wtdt/expendable_assets/,2021-05-07 19:59:36

steven_echo07,1620357180.0,n6p034,11.0,1.0,"An article written by Matteo Barzaghi on SkySport Italia regarding how Inter will be going forward economically, after today‚Äôs meeting. My take on it at the end. This is translated from Italian to English: 

‚ÄúThe victory of the title in the year of the pandemic, the desire to guarantee the future of the project, the need for a general reduction in the company's costs. The Nerazzurri president illustrated to the managers and staff of the club the guidelines for the future after the moment marked, for the whole football world, by the economic problems due to Covid-19. 

An effort for Inter.  This is the necessary recipe that Steven Zhang explained to the managers and staff of the company on site.  A serious and ambitious cost reduction plan to face the difficult economic moment that, since the beginning of the pandemic, has overwhelmed Inter and the world of football.  A policy that the Italian champions, from the managers to the coach to the players, will be called upon to implement to help the club in this delicate moment for everyone.  Zhang made it clear that he intends to ensure continuity to the project.

The message was direct: a radical policy of efficiency of all costs is needed in light of the understanding of the situation of post-Covid football.  For this reason, the managers and the whole squad are asked to understand the moment and to go individually to the plan studied. Obviously, while always trying to do the best possible, even the objectives will be commensurate with the investments: first of all we will start again to give continuity to the presence in the Champions League, that is to arrive in the top four, and also the coach will be protected regarding the objectives to be  reach, towards the public. The direction is indicated by the president Steven Zhang who has so far invested more than 800 million in Inter, has rebuilt Pinetina and changed headquarters. He took Marotta and Conte to win. He scored the most expensive shot in Nerazzurri history, Lukaku, and thus brought Inter back to victory.  Now after these efforts he asks for a new one. One step back today and then two steps forward in the future.‚Äù 


Ok, here‚Äôs my take: The message is that the upcoming mercato session will be about offloading big wages and managing the contracts of the players that are considered essential. The actual word for us will be ‚Äúausterity‚Äù. 
Without depth, I‚Äôm not sure how we can fight on so many ends, but whatever it is, we will fight and come back, whatever it is! 
This is the last season where we will be playing without fans (probably not the entire season this upcoming season), but we have to deal with this. 
The key moment is yet to come, as the discussion with Antonio Conte did not take place yet and our future will be determined by our coach. If he leaves, so will the staff and Lele Oriali. Let us pray and hope we come out of this well!! 

So, please, if you see stuff such as: Milinkovic-Savic to Inter or other players of his caliber, please don‚Äôt believe it. Follow Fabrizio Romano or Gianluca DiMarzio for mercato news, they are very reliable and they will make you understand if something is true or not. 

Feel free to have your take on this.

* Hakimi's stoppage time goal? Nail in the coffin?

We have a bunch of players that have practically never won a league trophy before within top 5 leagues. Doesn't matter if it's Handanoviƒá finally being rewarded after all this time, whether it's huge names like Lukaku or Eriksen, whether it's memeing with Ranocchia or everyone else such as Lautaro, Barella, de Vrij, Bastoni, ≈†kriniar, Brozoviƒá, etc., etc.

This is the first major trophy for majority of the squad. It's not one of many, that they're used to it. This is where they are rewarded. This will stay with them for a long time. This will create bonds in the team. 

Forza Inter squad.

Forza Conte.",FCInterMilan,"Just something I wanted to share... This Scudetto will be very memorable for our players as almost the entire squad was without a top 5 league trophies before this.

But they‚Äôve been there for Inter and they gave so much for the team at long last it paid off.
This goes to Lukaku after harrasment from English fans during his time in England but he never lost his soul and kept fighting for Inter
Goes to Eriksen who left Spurs because he never won teophies and somehow comes to Inter (why would he expect Inter to win a trophy don‚Äôt know) and had few hard first months but kept on
Goes to Hakimi who could start for almost any team in the world but decided to come to us despite having a bad decade amongst european team
Goes to Conte whom people didn‚Äôt believe him at some point but he made this group a unit which it is today
And it goes to our defensive backline and some other young players who are hopefully going to be our future

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really glad the team and Conte managed to turn the season around after getting eliminated from the Champions League. But I'm skeptical the tactics and playstyle we adopted will be beneficial in our next campaign. I'll try to explain what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

From a tactical standpoint, I see an abyss that separates us from the 10/15 top european teams. While we are great at attacking transitions once we retrieve the ball, beating a high press is something we struggle with a lot, we always run the same patterns so we become predictable.  
We also have issues with pressing high ourselves, even low-tier sides like Spezia break through with no problems at all.

I think the main issue is with the midfielders. They lack the commitment and intelligence to free themselves of the marker and the boldness of playing a difficult pass.   
I don't think we need to revolutionize our team on the market to improve. But Conte has to be aware of this situation and work in the summer to find solutions

r/FCInterMilan need your help. We want to expand our moderation team and hire a new mod.

We are looking for someone passionate about Inter and willing to dedicate some time to this role. If you are an active member of this community and like this idea, this is your chance! 

As it happened in the past, the new mod would initially have limited responsibilities and duties. We are talking about adding flairs to posts, look for off-topic / clone threads, monitor discussion and so on. Summer is a good time to start and get ready for the new season. In addition to this, having some coding skills would help in order to help u/ElectricalForm with the development of the bot.

If interested, let us know something about you. We would especially like to hear:

- how / when you found out about this community;

- your suggestions to improve our subreddit;

- if you have any previous experience with moderation or any skill you think would be useful;

- what time zone you're in.

Please leave a comment here (or contact us via modmail) and we'll get back to you. 

Cheers

For right wingback, with hakimi‚Äôs sad departure, the only 2 real options to come close to replacing him are Dumfries and Lazzari. The other names being tossed around like Zappacosta and Bellerin is a joke. I personally prefer Dumfries the most. Dumfries should cost around 20 Million, while Lazzari can be tough to negotiate due to our bad relationship with lazio‚Äôs president. For Left Wingback, there are a host of options. My preference is actually one that isn‚Äôt really linked to us at all. I would actually really like to have Cucurella from Getafe. He is a really impressive Left WingBack and I think he is the most cost efficient option with the greatest investment in money due to his young age. Other options I consider are: Kostic, Gosens, Alba. However, considering my preferences, signing Cucurella and Dumfries would cost about 20 Million for each deal. That would lead us to spending around 40 Million. I believe we have the ability to make such investment overall. Just these 2 deals then we can close the mercato.

I'm sorry but I get quite angry when I see some of you talk like were about to become the galactic football threat with Hakan as a 10 under Inzaghi, while we couldn't function with a 10 under Antonio fucking Conte.

#CLUB/TEAM NEWS

* Antonio Conte has quit Inter as head coach after a mutual agreement. Simone Inzaghi is the new head coach for 2020/21.

* Christian Eriksen's medical emergency will most likely lead to Eriksen having a pacemaker implemented, meaning that legally he wouldn't be allowed to play in Serie A again. His Inter future is in doubt.

---

#NOTES

* Considering the fact that Inter doesn't disclose signing fees or additional details (sell-on clause, etc.) on announcements, the transfer fee and details are usually taken from most reliable rumors for said transfer.

* Estimated value is taken from Transfermarkt at the time of addition to the list.

* Tables with players are sorted from most valuable to least valuable.

* Transfers for players that have arrived back to us only to leave again will only be recorded in the departures section.

---

#OTHER

* The thread will be sorted by new so you can always keep a on-going discussion in the comments.

ysf02,1624293409.0,o4zbav,9.0,2.0,"Just to provide more knowledge on what Calhanoglu has done for Milan &amp; Turkey in recent times. 

Since football returned from COVID in May 2020 (one year ago), Hakan has scored 15 times and assisted 20 times for Milan. He has scored 3 goals and assisted 6 goals for Turkey. 

In total, including domestic &amp; international level he has scored 18 goals and provided 26 assists since May 2020 (one year ago). 

There are also more analytical stats that suggest Hakan is one of the best chance creators in Europe and the best in Serie A. 

As a player, if you haven‚Äôt watched him, I‚Äôd best describe his qualities as a composed #10 who links up the midfield to the attack and creates very good chances for strikers like Lukaku or Lautaro. Hakan had very good chemistry with Ibrahimovic. Another quality about him that you don‚Äôt find in many other #10‚Äôs is his ability to track back defensively. He‚Äôs not great defensively, but he tracks back a lot and puts aggressive pressure. 

However, he needs protective midfielders behind him who can win tackles and progress the ball, and sometimes he can get lost in a game. Which paints his sometimes, exaggerated, image as being inconsistent. I personally think Hakan will thrive in Inter and will build a solid link up with Lukaku and Lautaro. 

Bonus: if he‚Äôs given enough space, he often likes to take long shots and sometimes he has extremely impressive shots",FCInterMilan,Hakan Calhanoglu statistics:,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/o4zbav/hakan_calhanoglu_statistics/,2021-06-22 00:36:49

But, Hiba talked Augustina (then Lautaro) to change agent, while there was an agreement to renew the contract with old Lauti's agent.

Camano (current agent of our 2 and 10) is playing a little dirt, and thanks to Hiba's help, he doubled his power in our beloved FC inter.

I really can't see us selling just Lautaro or Hakimi + some fringe players and buying replacements for any of these 2.

It appears as if the Inter Store has pulled a fast one by advertising the new kit without a sponsor on their website, but instead will be sending them with the new sponsor. This is not 100% confirmed, but it seems to be all over Twitter and a few other sites. 

I am looking for someone based in Milano who would be willing to go to the Inter store and buy me a kit with no sponsor and then mail it to me in the US. I am willing to find a fair compensation for this person above the cost of the shirt and shipping. 

I am trying to find out if this is possible before I relent to having the kit with the new sponsor. 

Also, if you aren‚Äôt in Milan or can‚Äôt go, but know someone who might be able, I would welcome being connected with them.

Also with new managers like Mourinho and sarri with Allegri returning as well as consistency in Atalanta and Milan with the managers remaining leave everything as open as it is now.


My opinion is depending on who we‚Äôll get for the wingbacks i could adjust the expectations accordingly, i feel we will do better in the champions league as Conte in general always disappoints there, and Inzaghi turning alot of players from nobodys or less known into big names like Lucas Leiva, Acerbi, Luis Alberto, and others.

In Lazio, Inzaghi mainly played a possession-attacking football, but his team were efficient in counter attacks too. 

Do you think Inzaghi will continue using the same tactics Conte used? 

I find it hard to predict since Inzaghi only coached 1 team, and built it from scratch. Until now, he didn't give much indications of being tactically flexible, like Allegri for example. So, I have got an inkling he will not totally stick with the same way Conte played. 

Frankly I hope we try to stick with our identity as much as possible. It's what we are good at anyway, but I won't mind Inzaghi trying new things, hopefully that target our weaknesses rather than replacing our strengths.",FCInterMilan,What do you think Inzaghi will offer compared to Conte?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/ok8v44/what_do_you_think_inzaghi_will_offer_compared_to/,2021-07-15 01:11:59

Hey guys,

Wondering if anyone has had previous experience ordering anything from '[footsoccerpro.co](https://footsoccerpro.co)'?

I was looking to grab this years kit, which I typically get from the official site, or one or two other places, but the shipping cost from the official site is \*really\* expensive to where I'm at, and the others I normally use only have the non-sponsor version at the moment.

'.co' is Colombian, but the site is in French/English, which seems a bit odd.  The site itself looks pretty well done, and there is a bunch of Inter stuff there, and it seems oddly specific stuff too - both old and new things.  They have all the standard socials from what I can see (but are only recently setup from what I can tell). 

The gear itself is apparently from Thailand.  The images they have on the site seem original and look pretty good to me.

Anyone used these guys before or know anything about them?",FCInterMilan,Online kit reseller query,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/pcn5r3/online_kit_reseller_query/,2021-08-27 21:16:51

AlKarakhboy,1630006134.0,pc6ms2,9.0,1.0,"I loved the hyper attacking way we played vs Genoa, building on Conte's work of having bastoni and skrinar push forward and overlapping wingbacks that can receive and feed from the target man but I thought our defence was a bit suspect. Inzaghi's problem with Lazio was their defence, and although he has better players now we looked vulnerable against Genoa who does not have much firepower. We saw Kaloun get two one on ones pretty much as well as a couple of shots that went straight at Handanovic + the clearance of the line from Vanhuadson's shot. 

I only watched the highlights for Verona - Sass and although their defence looked pretty bad, they threatened on the counter and had some beautiful attacks. I also think Verona is much more representative to the average quality of the league (much better squad than Genoa imho) so it will be intresting how our defence deals with it. Of course, we are no strangers to playing against low block Serie A teams which I think the majority of teams will play that way against this season as usual and hoping for the counter-attack, but with Inzaghi pushing more men forward, it will be interesting to see how he handles it defensively. 

We only play Verona and Sampdoria before our first CL game, and we need to have had some sort of idea of how to set up before then, esp if the first game isn't Sheriff.

We still have Latauro, Sanchez, Dzeko, and Hakan who can get us goals, plus whoever stays from Pinamonti, Salcedo, or Satrino.

Meanwhile, our midfield, the weakest point of our squad from last season, has still not received reinforcement.  Vidal is finished and Sensi will inevitably get injured again. leaving us with brozovic and barella playing every game until they're dead. Handanovic is also still a liability and betting on Onana joining us next season is a bit risky when this season could be decided by a Handanovic mistake like what happened with the coppa last season.

But we are definitely still playing our football, and there‚Äôs team play despite different changes in our previous lineup.

I think that without too much injuries, we are able to achieve at least top-4 finish, which is the main objective domestically.

One thing I noticed about Inzaghi‚Äôs football is how much the whole team is involved. We are not particularly dependent on 1 player (ie Lukaku) 

Perisic seems dangerous on the left after being clueless most of the games with Conte. I believe Inzaghi is giving him more freedom to attack.

We play very good possession game, with too much technical players. Inzaghi used 4 midfielders behind Dzeko, which all can keep possession of the ball and create chances. After this game I understand if Inzaghi wants Correa instead of Zapata. Inzaghi has no problem playing with only 1 between Dzeko and Lautaro, and prefers more technical players up front.

We also play too much (directed) long balls, switching the play a lot. Something we lacked with the less-risk-taking approach Conte adopted.

1/Dzeko is meant to be Lukaku's replacement

2/The other striker is a work in progress for now (this part is speculation on my part but don't expect the 2nd striker to be one to one replacement for Lukaku, and either way neither Correa nor Insigne fit that profile)

3/Dumfries means Nandez is no longer on Inter's list

Lukaku was phenomenal when he had to keep the ball using his body; Moreno  can use his passing skills for the same purpose.

I'm watching him against Chelsea: he never wastes a ball.  We need this kind of player: Barella, Brozovic and Lautaro aren't perfect when they pass the ball. We could use somebody more accurate in the last 20 meters, without Eriksen.

asoulinthisworld,1628511533.0,p10bnu,34.0,1.0,"Never posted here before, but i see alot of demoralized interista nowadays. Just wanted to tell you that we are the Italian champions, dont forget that

And talking about departures, we still have the best defense in the league, best CBs, Samir is atleast a top 3. We lost Hakimi but lets not forget that he was benched by Conte because of his defense, offensively it hurts but replacement candidates have great offensive value as well. And for the left wingback we had to play different player every game because we didn‚Äôt have a reliable player, now we have a talent like DiMarco. Brozovic and Barella are the best CMs in Italy, Hakan have great potential and Vidal from his comments look like a man that wants to prove himself and lets not forget Sensi who had more hype than Barella when both joined because of his talent. For the offense we still have Lautaro that can step up and with Inzaghi he is known for making strikers better, and with Lukaku leaving we will bring a starter and depth option which we lacked last season when we played mostly with only 2 when Sanchez was out

With Conte i still remember most interista wanting him out 3 months before the end of the season, before starting the winning streak. He‚Äôs amazing no doubt but its not the end of the world and I believe Inzaghi is the perfect replacement

Lothar18,1628510853.0,p105io,10.0,1.0," I think this definitely slows down our pursuit for Duvan Zapta, and the season starts in 2 weeks. There's no way Atalanta lets Zapata go until they get a replacement, that's exactly what they did with Spurs, they already had an agreement over the transfer of Romero but they wouldn't let him leave until they got Demiral.",FCInterMilan,"According to Di Marzio, Atalanta has pulled out of the race to sign Tammy Abraham",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/p105io/according_to_di_marzio_atalanta_has_pulled_out_of/,2021-08-09 20:07:33
Rezorblade,1628503727.0,p0yjc0,39.0,1.0,"Many are moaning and grunting when reports abound about Dzeko move to Inter to replace Lukaku. I think this one transfer totally make sense regarding our situation and circumstances. Here's why

+ Dzeko comes cheap, his salary also isn't that awful (i think it's 5m per year for 2 years excluding bonus). If we target another striker to come, Operation Dzeko makes sense because it's not cost too much, and Beppe able to conclude this transfer fairly quick and easy

+ Dzeko is class and class is permanent, even tho he's very old now he still one of the best Serie A striker at the moment, he scored 85 Goals and contribute 39 Assist on 199 Roma matches, making him an instant legend for them, one season his record are even better than Batistuta. his G+A record aren't good last season (only 7 goal, 4 assist) but last season he got Covid and there's problem with the coach too. His Europa League record is somewhat better (6 goal, 1 assist) as Roma run to Semi Final of that competition. Statistic wise last season is one of his worst. It's unclear if this because many problems he had or his age finally caught up. Surely a refresh in environment is needed and Inter might be a good place for it

+ Many joking about age in Serie A, Dzeko is 35 but in Serie A that makes him 28 or something, he still got space to play in this competition, even Ibrahimovic still thriving in the age of 40, his vast experience is needed to tutor Lautaro and Satriano. There's also Alexis so with another Striker coming i think our Frontline is complete for now.

+ Dzeko coming means we directly weakened our rival Roma, if our target for next season is Top 4, this is a positive thing, somehow many Roma fans actually cry about this transfer, they are losing a legend, maybe not as mad as we losing Lukaku, but Dzeko so beloved there still

+ Unlike Lukaku, Dzeko actually loves big matches and can be very clutch on it. This is important for our UCL season where we are likely to meet big clubs very early in group stage",FCInterMilan,Edin Dzeko makes sense,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/p0yjc0/edin_dzeko_makes_sense/,2021-08-09 18:08:47

Me personally as a fan, he let me down and disappointed me, after going public in June saying he was going to stay and had already talked with Inzaghi and was excited for the new season and ready to win the 20th scudetto and gain the 2nd star. 

I know most he will never see this post and even if he did he wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck, but I‚Äôll never forgive him for leaving us less than 10 days before the league starts, as a fan always. I don‚Äôt hold any grudges with him, but what he did was really a kick in the balls sort of. 

If he left with Conte and Hakimi after we won the Scudetto, fair enough, but no, he said he was looking forward to the new season. Meaning he left to Chelsea purely for the wage increase, and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong, but to do this after saying all of that, I find it really disappointing, personally.

Also I‚Äôm not an ungrateful son of a bitch, I enjoyed his time here, and I wasn‚Äôt going to say this, but tell me one time we needed him in big matches where he delivered. Exactly. He only showed up vs Borussia Monchengladbach in UCL matchday 5 and only against Milan.

vik1980,1628316944.0,ozo0vb,35.0,1.0,"These days, Suning, Inter Milan's Chinese owners are really under the pump. They've come under massive pressure for basically dismantling a Series A title winning squad after just the first win, leaving a lot of titles on the table. Hakimi (potentially the best RB/ RWB for the next decade) was sold after just one season. Lukaku (consensus Top 5 striker in the world) is next. Conte resigned because he knew what was coming.  All when the squad could've win consistently for the next 5 years, and competed for the next 10. A fairly young starting squad, a dynamic coach, a top notch management team, every fundamental piece was already there. Just the financial requirements were to be met, and it was all there. Right now they look like hawkers holding a garage sale.

However, this was not always the case. At one point, they really seemed like fantastic owners. Outside of being in bed with the CCP, there weren't many 'issues' with them. To understand how serious they were, Steven Zhang (Inter head) is the son of Suning head Zhang Jindong. He shifted to Milano permanently when they bought Inter. They didn't see Inter as a vanity project (to be discarded once they got tired of it), or a vehicle to repair a bad public image. They saw the club as a flag mast for their company, to portray an image of success. They were prepared to invest heavily the club to see it done so, as seen by them spending 200+m in the first two seasons, along with [constructing a new HQ](http://www.marcaenzona.com/en/post/inter-inaugurated-a-new-headquarters-in-the-center-of-milan), and [upgrading the training ground](https://www.inter.it/en/news/2020/07/11/suning-training-centre-new-clubhouse-inaugurated.html). 

However, rather than just spending, they had a real idea, a proper business plan behind it all. Being in the retail sector, they wanted a successful Inter so their could sell a ton of official merchandise (mugs, phone covers etc.) in their stores. And they saw the TV deals as the real money spinners behind football, and secured the rights to broadcast both the Premier League, La Liga &amp; Serie A matches in China. They hoped that the Ad revenue there would not only offset the costs, but turn out to be quite profitable. They also had a Chinese team (Jiangsu Suning) in the Chinese top flight. they wanted to connect it all under the ['**Suning Sports**'](https://www.suningholdings.com/cms/snSports/index.htm) division. Despite Sports not being Suning's core business (it was Retail), it was all well thought out and planned. So, where did it all go wrong? 

Well, it wasn't just a singular reason, despite the pandemic being the obvious answer. [Firstly, they invested in football on the directive of Xi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbrennan/2016/06/07/how-italys-inter-milan-is-now-working-for-the-growing-chinese-empire/?sh=4421dd289729), the Chinese Premier. He wanted to promote football in a big way, and offered lots of financial rewards in this sector. This is what resulted in a glut of foreign stars (Tevez, Carrasco, Paulinho, Capello, Lippi etc.) going to China, and a lot of Chinese ownership in European football. Even before the pandemic, it came out that the Chinese economy was shaking (they never share any figures, so it's difficult to estimate accurately, and is mostly speculation). When [Xi reversed on this initial directive](https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-communist-party-forcing-investors-to-pull-money-out-of-european-football/a-57171818), and ordered all owners to stop funds going out of China in sports; it Inter in a lurch, but still not completely helpless. Then the pandemic happened, and being in the Retail sector in China, they felt this hit much harder than the rest. It really catapulted them to financial jeopardy. But things weren't as straightforward as this.

You first have to understand how deep in bed they were with the CCP. When Xi visited Madrid, Zhang Jindong was part of the travelling delegation (even asking Xi to make a stopover at Milano). At some point between all this, Suning invested (probably at the behest of the CCP) a few Billions Euros in Chinese construction giant Evergrande. When Evergrande tanked, it swept the floor from underneath Suning, leaving them with a lot of liquidity problems. Even then, when other investors demanded their money back from Evergrande (which would've saved Suning, but made Evergrande insolvent), [Suning didn't](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3109148/suning-founder-zhang-jindong-who-helped-evergrande-avoid-cash) (again at the behest of the CCP). To (partly) solve their liquidity problems, [they sold a minority stake in their online portal to the CCP](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3139954/chinese-tech-giants-bail-out-suningcom-us14-billion-government-backed) (for a couple Billions). They also [sold a large stake in their parent company to Alibaba](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-05/china-state-fund-that-includes-alibaba-to-invest-in-suning-unit) (online retailer).

Somewhere during all this, they also ended up defaulting on their payments for the PL deal, which lead to [the PL terminating the contract](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/03/premier-league-cancels-564m-chinese-tv-contract-in-blow-to-clubs-finances). They also, straight-up [closed their Chinese club](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12231456/jiangsu-fc-chinese-football-in-chaos-as-super-league-champions-cease-operations) (Jiangsu Suning). All these lead to a clear indication that Suning was pulling back from their Sports investments. Reports came out that they were looking to sell Inter Milan too, but no acceptable offers were made, and they secured a loan to meet financial commitments for the club. When the ESL project died, a large 'future cash prospect' for the company died with it.

Well, these recent dealings have shaken the company's future so hard that Zhang Jindog has resigned from his leadership position in the company. Steve Zhang is also under so much fan pressure that he's been holed up in China for extended periods now, choosing not to return to Milan (which he left during the pandemic). Now, the recent sales clearly show that they're looking to recoup their investment in the club one way or another, and will probably sell it to a buyer soon, or look to become financially independent (probably like Dortmund, Leipzig etc.).",FCInterMilan,Where did it all go wrong for Suning?,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/ozo0vb/where_did_it_all_go_wrong_for_suning/,2021-08-07 14:15:44
FishNFortnite,1628277127.0,ozddzi,25.0,1.0,"After reading and researching some more about Suning and Zhang's positions in terms of finances, I just dont understand what their plan is.

For those that aren't aware, Suning agreed to a loan worth 336 million dollars from Oaktree Capital. Then a month ago, Suning was bailed out for 1.4 billion dollars by the Chinese govt and Alibaba. This led to Steven Zhang's father stepping down as Suning chairman.

A couple days ago, Suning was sued by creditors in China for 255 million dollars for unpaid debt. Clearly their entire business and revenue was either a sham, massively overestimated, or nearly bankrupted by horrible deals and the pandemic. I just don't see what Zhang's strategy is for Inter, when they clearly are heavily indebted both domestically and internationally. Don't forget that even if they weren't massively indebted, China put the clamps down on foreign investment. 

Suning bought Inter for 307 million dollars. They had various offers to sell the club for more than they paid just 5 years ago before foolishly turning down the offers. If they sells all our players in the next 3 years to repay Oaktree, we are left with a shit club but Suning is no longer in debt to 1 of many companies. However at that point, we will be losing prize money, ticket sales and merchandise from a pissed off fan base. Not to mention Suning still can't invest money (that doesn't exist due to massive domestic debt) from outside China.",FCInterMilan,Suning longterm plan?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FCInterMilan/comments/ozddzi/suning_longterm_plan/,2021-08-07 03:12:07

There are three ways: if the response is positive, Christian will be able to remove the defibrillator and aim to return to the field within at least six months; in the event of a negative outcome, at least in Italy he will no longer be able to play football; and then there is the third possibility with an intermediate response: without a definitive response - the situation improved but with traces of the inflammation still present - we will opt for new tests in the autumn, thus postponing the decision on Christian's future.

Instead, barely two months later, the main protagonists are gone; Conte, Oriali, Hakimi and the symbol of this team, a new bright star in our black and blue sky, being forced out. Was anybody able to enjoy the celebrations?

In a footballing world where loyalty is seemingly a thing of the past, we stand to lose a player, a man, who took on the mantle of a king while demonstrating how human he truly is.

To everyone here that said we should have sold him instead of Hakimi... I agree but these are different situations. We HAD to sell to raise 80 million before the end of june. We had no offers for Martinez at the time, so hakimi was the only option. Sad but we had to do it. Or else we wouldn't have sold him. As for Martinez... Now we are getting some offers. And, compared to hakimi, Lautaro doesn't see Inter as a priority in his career like hakimi saw Inter. Hakimi didn't want to leave. Lautaro does want to leave. We should we keep a player that doesn't see this team as a priority? He would never play at 100% with that mindset. 

Also Lautaro didn't do us any favour either. Yeah he scored 15 goals and some assists, but we all know he could do better. But doesn't. Because he is looking for a better team. But while he is concentrated on finding a better team, his form goes down cuz he isn't concentrated on the field and, as a result, not many teams see him as a great striker. But Hakimi had a Wonderful season. Why? Cuz he wanted to be here. Cuz he loved it here. He felt comfortable and good and didn't want to leave. But because he played at 100%(and more than that) and got these amazing stats... People saw him, loved him, and wanted him on their team. Same goes for Lukaku. That's why chelsea wants him for 130 million. But we ain't selling him. Cuz this time, we don't need to sell him and he doesn't want to leave either. Not like hakimi, that we had to sell at the time. And not like Lautaro, that wants to leave. So i won't blame suning or Mr. Beppe and Ausillio. But i shall blame our Damn luck.
