1ngK,1601226039.0,j0ujy8,6.0,1.0,"Some of you may already be familiar with my habits of making a brief analysis and review after every matches. Today is a special day indeed, so may I create an individual post for that. If anyone have thoughts on the match feel free to write it down below too!

As you can see, today we saw a much more offensive Atleti. We had 56% possession, a figure we don‚Äôt usually see. The biggest change imo is how we attacked much faster during counters. With Carrasco, Felix and Correa, you could notice how quick we transited from defence to attack. Even more so during the second half because you know, Llorente is god damn fast. We are able to control the attacking tempo the whole game, thanks to the fact that Felix is taking well charge of it. He is our maestro, without a doubt. Every attackers looked hungry, even Vitolo and Lemar are doing well today, which is a very, very good look into the season.

The biggest drawbacks are, firstly the penalty missed and the midfield. Saul should do better there, but the fact is we need to make Felix our primary talent because he will be our talisman for year. He needs to take and improves them. 
For the midfield, I‚Äôm not really a fan of the Koke - Saul double pivots. They aren‚Äôt as physical and progressive, that‚Äôs why I think Partey is really needed here. I won‚Äôt mind if they improve in this role, but as of now they aren‚Äôt really that type of player to put here imo, especially Koke. Both of them play much better in an advanced role.

Couldn‚Äôt get the clean sheet is unlucky, but I think this match is more than enough to show we can be a really good offensive side. We need to maintain this performance, and if we do so I‚Äôm sure that we can win titles this year.


**Scoreboard:** 

Diego Costa 1 goal (1 sexy dummy as well)

Joao Felix 1 goal 1 assist

Angel Correa 1 goal 2 assists

Marcos Llorente 1 goal 1 assist

Luis Suarez 2 goals 1 assist

**Individual:**

Costa: Showing a much different character on the pitch today. Making more runs and you can feel his sense gels well with other attackers, especially the dummy for Felix's goal. A drawback is he still getting dispossessed a bit often and he isn't fast enough. Still, a really impressive performance for him which makes us hopeful for more of him this season.

Felix: Basically running the game. Easily MOTM. You can see him became much more confident and he's everywhere on the pitch today. Good interplays, vision, smart passing, and that composure in front of goal. If he maintains this performance this kid is gonna write history here. One thing to note, Felix should be our first penalty taker any time any day.

Correa: Decisive performance, Angel. At first I was confused since he kept giving away possession, but you know, Correa will somehow makes it count. Good cross for Costa, good technique for his goal and good run+good ball for Felix. There's nothing to complain for his performance today with 3 contributions. He was kinda lost after restart last season, but hopefully he can keep his consistency because we all know he is fantastic on his day.

Carrasco: Didn't get onto the scoreboard but still a good performance. His footwork and control really gave us life on the left. Had some good plays with Felix, and is a big threat in counters. I‚Äôm satisfied with his performance today, but he needs to show even more because Llorente is no joke right now. 

Koke, Saul: The duo had a quiet game but acceptable. Today they were better than vs Lepizig, and we progressed the ball better. However, you can still see both of them are much better playing higher up. I hope they can improve in this role because if we‚Äôre playing 4-2-3-1 as our main formation, they will be the pivots since Simeone never drops them.

Lodi and Trippier: Good performance on both ends, but lacking the preciseness in final third. Both of them got some good chances but the deliveries are a bit off. Did well moving the ball and defending though. Won‚Äôt think too much for the first game of the season, as I believe they will do good very soon.

Savic and Felipe: decent performance. I can‚Äôt rate this duo that high because I can‚Äôt really feel the synergy between them. For example the incident between them, they should never go for the ball at the same time. They need to find a way to complement the other instead of trying to be a good stopper on their own in every scenario. I hope they improve as it goes, but you know that Atletico vein won‚Äôt feel good when we concede, even when we‚Äôre up 4 goals, lol.

Oblak: good performance as usual. Had some good saves, the goal conceded isn‚Äôt really his fault. All I say is keep up the good performance, because Oblak is too flawless to be criticised every single game.

Partey: you can see he really progresses the ball with so much ease. The composure and passing are gold, which makes him the perfect player for our pivot. He didn‚Äôt play long so not much to say though, hope we can see him start in the next match. 

Llorente: GOAT. You know he‚Äôs gonna score once he came on lol, and he did so within a minute. His pace is out of this world which makes him so hard to mark, and you can see his delivery and composure are on point as well for Suarez‚Äôs goal. Not to mention his finishing are good af. Such a joy to watch. 

Vitolo, Lemar: I have to say, they had a good display. They seem more involved, and actually doing dangerous plays, such as Vitolo‚Äôs pass to release Llorente and Lemar‚Äôs through ball to Vitolo. I hope they can keep this up, because we all know they have the qualities in them, they just need to show it consistently.

Suarez: well, the best is for the last. What else can I say? 3 contributions in 20 minutes, and he could‚Äôve got two more goals if he‚Äôs luckier. The impact he had on the team is insane. Look at that movement in the box, it is what we‚Äôve been missing. He knows how to be the focal point of the attack, and I just can‚Äôt wait to see him pairing up with Felix. 

Conclusion, I can‚Äôt believe this is Atleti. I‚Äôm so impressed by literally every players, and I‚Äôm convinced that we can have a wonderful season coming for us. All it takes is, well, Cholo don‚Äôt revert to a defensive setup which sees us losing points stupidly again. Though, it‚Äôs barely the first game, we need to see more of this display in upcoming matches to see.

**Match Facts**

 * Atl√©tico Madrid established themselves as a sharp starter last season, finishing the 2019/20 La Liga (LL) campaign as one of six clubs to not only score first in the majority (11) of their home games - six of them inside the first 30 minutes - but also remain undefeated (W9, D2) when doing so.

 * Despite conceding four equalisers at home across the season, Atl√©tico also finished their LL campaign as one of just three teams to have not lost as a home favourite. Their 66.67% win rate from such games (W12, D6) was above the league average. A solid defence, which accrued ten home clean sheets, restricted 63.16% of their games to under 2.5 total goals.


 * Two from two to start this season, Granada have nonetheless suffered defeat in every competitive trip to Atl√©tico this century, and won only one of 24 such trips since the birth of LL (W1, D3, L20). Notably, ‚ÄòEl Gran√°‚Äô have scored in both halves of each of their last four competitive away games, though their last away defeat in LL saw them draw a blank vs Atlet√≠ (W4, D3 since).


 * The visitors have already secured their best run of wins in LL this century as they aim for a fifth straight victory. A patient strike force has hit goals beyond HT in each of their last nine LL matches since a 0-0 draw at Leganes. Consequently, 36 of Granada‚Äôs last 56 scored LL goals have come beyond HT (64.29%), including three of four scored this term.


 * Players to watch: √Ångel Correa recorded five goals and seven assists for Atl√©tico last LL campaign, with all five goals being their first of the game.


 * Roberto Soldado has already opened his account for 2020/21, after scoring in four of Granada‚Äôs last seven games of the 2019/20 LL campaign.


 * Hot stat: All but one of Granada‚Äôs last nine away games of the 2019/20 LL season produced at least five total cards (average: 7.0 per game).

&gt;  
&gt;*- Gabi will continue training in Madrid to become a coach.*  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, **Gabi Fern√°ndez** will not return to **Atletico Madrid** this summer to become part of **Diego Simeone**'s coaching staff. It was an option that was evaluated and was on the table. What's more, everything indicated that it would happen. But finally, Cholo will complete their staff with Argentinean **Hernan Bonvicini**, who was already assistant to **Nelson Vivas** (who will now be second in command) on the Estudiantes bench.  
&gt;  
&gt;The former Colchonero captain met with **Simeone** in March, before Atletico travelled to Liverpool for the second leg of the Champions League. The footballer encouraged his former teammates and talked with Cholo about the possibility of working together, performing a function similar to that once performed by **Vizcaino** or **Tiago**, now head coach of Vitoria de Guimaraes.  
&gt;  
&gt;But **Gabi**'s return will have to wait. Once his adventure in Qatar is over, the Leganes native will return to Madrid and plans to continue training to be a coach, something he already started in the Asian country while playing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Madrid-born player will continue to learn a profession that he already aimed at when he was dressed in red and white, and he will surely have the opportunity in the club of his loves, either in the first team or in the lower categories.

OLEDJesus,1598948624.0,ikgi7k,13.0,6.0,"**Atl√©tico Madrid 2020-21, pre season**

*There are few teams as consistent as Atletico Madrid. In 2019-20, they qualified among the top three in La Liga for the eighth consecutive season. A run of seven wins and four draws after the restart of the competition in May took them from sixth to third place at the end of the season.*

They did so with their usual style of play. Diego Simeone's team defended in a compact mid-low block and protected their goal well. They received a below average amount of shots, while the average quality of these shots was the lowest in all of La Liga. They conceded only 27 goals, the second best figure in the division. At the other end of the field, they attacked in a precise way, prioritizing the quality over the quantity of the shots. Only Barcelona and Alav√©s created chances of higher average quality.

https://preview.redd.it/yblutl3ashk51.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41b53de1b152e5147a7d3328fcd4aa18f022ef97

It was the same Atl√©tico as always, despite the changes in the squad. Antoine Griezmann, Diego Godin, Filipe Luis and Rodri, four of the eight players who had played the most minutes in 2018-19, went out. Also, Juanfran and Lucas Hern√°ndez, two of the first 15, left. Eight players arrived as replacements for an amount close to 250 million euros.

It was not a total revolution. Simeone gave 65% of the minutes to players who had played in 2018-19, the pink ones in the graph below, but some of the new players received significant amounts of minutes. Felipe, Kieran Trippier and Renan Lodi played over 2,000; Jo√£o Felix, over 1,800; and Marcos Llorente, almost 1,500.

https://preview.redd.it/duuzkybfthk51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6258b88f0075c834755147baf11c46f3fc664813

The assumption was that Atl√©tico needed time to integrate the signings well and the reality was so, at least in terms of results. After winning their first three games of the season, they won only three of the next 13, along with eight draws and two losses. At the beginning of December they were in seventh place.

However, the underlying numbers told a different story. At that time, Atl√©tico had a goal difference (not counting penalties) of five goals, but an expected goal difference (xG) of 9.53. That is, it was more than four goals below the expected.

The results began to improve from there, although the actual numbers took even longer to resemble the underlying numbers that were always among the best in La Liga. This graph compares the goal difference with the xG difference throughout the season, using a moving average of 10 games. The purple zone represents underperformance; the green zone, overperformance.

https://preview.redd.it/rqdqit1auhk51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dee2e371b89af776c4e3b6ca1e154ea792f89c80

There were times when the narrative seemed to be that Simeone's methods were running out, something that resurfaced after the sluggish Champions League elimination against RB Leipzig. It is true that it was an acceptable season rather than an excellent one and that Atl√©tico achieved its lowest points total (70) of Simeone's time. However, the team fulfilled the expectations in what was a transitional year in which they had, on a weighted minute basis, the third youngest team in La Liga. When the actual numbers resembled the underlying numbers, it was the third best team in the division.

Felix was the star signing, with a high cost of 126 million euros. The price clearly conditions the conversation, but if we leave it aside we see a player who combined a very showy style of play with very acceptable numbers for a first season in La Liga given his age (20) and the approach of Atl√©tico.

https://preview.redd.it/u32nd3m7whk51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6c314c6f043fdc09a899e824d1b72d4832046c

In common with all Atletico's strikers, the former Benfica player started the season with a bad streak that lasted until the end of January, but between his return from injury in February and the end of the season, he scored four goals that changed the perspective a bit. However, given his talent, a step forward is expected in 2020-21.

https://preview.redd.it/2xjfh2chwhk51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f474aeb28cffb29d612be02304e9800ec34e45ca

Simeone never seemed totally happy with his options in attack. He wanted Rodrigo Moreno from Valencia, but he never came. Many different players played minutes between the two forward positions and the more offensive side in his usual 4-4-2: Felix, Alvaro Morata, Angel Correa, Diego Costa, Thomas Lemar, Vitolo, Yannick Carrasco (who returned on loan in January and could continue with the club this season) and even Llorente, a midfielder reconverted to second forward. Of all of them, only Correa and Morata played more than 2,000 minutes and even they played less than 2,300 even though they each only lost four games due to injuries or sanctions.

The numbers showed that the best forward duo would be Felix and Morata. They contributed more xG and xG assisted for 90 minutes than their teammates. Morata has his detractors but he is a striker who always has the ability to manufacture good quality chances.

Llorente impressed in his more advanced role after the break, often acting as an accelerator and energizer of the team's attacks, and it will be interesting to see if he is able to maintain such impressive creative numbers in a larger sample.

https://preview.redd.it/ma5olms0xhk51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a5ab06e85be8535120571c9f61cd283423c3e0d

Between the injuries and his poor production on goal (he has scored only one goal for every 464 minutes on the field since his return from Chelsea in 2017), Costa is no longer the player he once was. He is in the final year of his contract and if he stays it should be mainly as a revolver.

In midfield, Koke, Saul and Thomas Partey consumed the vast majority of minutes. There is still the possibility that Partey will come out, but anyway, Simeone wants a positional midfield to reinforce this area. It seems that Marc Roca is the chosen one. He had a quiet season in the relegation of Espanyol, but he has a sufficient talent base to become a very useful player in Atl√©tico with time to settle down.

There are no problems in the center of the defense. Felipe enjoyed a good season after his arrival from Porto and between him, Jose Gimenez and Stefan Savic the area is well covered. Mario Hermoso could go out for lack of minutes and in that case another option would arrive.

There are more doubts in the side positions. On the left, Renan Lodi had a good first season in La Liga but did not have a replacement of the same quality. On the right, Trippier played most of the minutes. He started the season well, exhibiting his great set-piece and also played an important role in advancing the ball into the box, but as with Tottenham Hotspur, doubts arose about his defensive fitness as the season progressed.

Along with Santiago Arias and ≈†ime Vrsaljko, Trippier is one of Atletico's three experienced right-backs. According to reports the club is willing to sell any of the three if a good offer comes in.

Overall, it looks like it will be a relatively quiet transfer market for Atl√©tico. The only arrival so far is Ivo Grbic, a Croatian goalkeeper who will replace the departure of Antonio Adan. Apart from the possible signing of Roca, the rest of the reinforcements will probably arrive in the form of a loan. Players such as Lemar or Vitolo could leave, who could create space for youngsters like V√≠ctor Mollejo, who made an interesting campaign in Deportivo La Coru√±a playing both as a winger and as an attacker.

In general, Atl√©tico seems to be in a good position for the new season. There are some weaknesses and problems to solve, and it is unlikely that they will compete for the title, but they have the talent to turn the third best budget in La Liga into a Champions League position again. It could be that Sevilla FC or another team like Real Sociedad or Villarreal will have a fantastic season to be among the first three, but it is unlikely that two of these teams will be able to surpass Atl√©tico. Regularity has its benefits.

**Match Facts**



 * Osasuna host Atl√©tico Madrid after three successive clean sheets (W2, D1), averaging 1.0 goals per match, and with either a goal or an opposition red card coming between the 76th minute and FT. Further to that sense of consistency, a 1-0 win vs Athletic Bilbao in the third game means that Osasuna have seen each of their last 22 La Liga (LL) victories produce a one or two-goal margin.

 * Last season‚Äôs corresponding H2H took place in June, with Osasuna‚Äôs 5-0 defeat sparked by the ever-dangerous Jo√£o F√©lix‚Äôs double. That match contributed the most to an average of 3.80 goals conceded across their last five home league defeats, and their average losing margin across the last four H2Hs overall is not far behind, at 3.25 goals.

 * Atl√©tico Madrid have mimicked Osasuna somewhat lately, averaging exactly 1.0 goal per match across their last four LL outings (W2, D2), while scoring late (beyond the 89th minute) in both wins. In relation to that, they have averaged 2.0 goals beyond the hour mark across their last three league victories.

 * Across all of their league wins attained so far this season, the ‚ÄòRojiblancos‚Äô have won the second half by an average margin of 2.33 goals. They are expected to win again here, but Atl√©tico have notably drawn exactly 50% of their LL away matches entered as favourites (W7, D9, L2) since the start of 2019/20.

 * Players to watch: Rub√©n Garc√≠a netted from the spot in Osasuna‚Äôs win vs Athletic Bilbao. Both of his prior goals this term have arrived between the 76th-90th+ minutes of play.

 * Atl√©tico‚Äôs Jo√£o F√©lix was also at the double in midweek vs Salzburg. Two of his three prior LL away goals have each made the scoreline 2-0 at the time scored in their respective games.

 * Hot stat: Osasuna have taken just one point from their previous six LL home games vs last season‚Äôs top three (D1, L5) being outscored exactly 5:1 therein (GF 4, GA 20). However, none of those ‚Äògoals against‚Äô came inside the opening 20 minutes.

**Match Facts**



 * Atl√©tico Madrid started their UEFA Champions League (UCL) campaign in the worst possible way, falling to their joint-biggest defeat under manager Diego Simeone as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayern Munich. That game also saw them concede twice before HT for the first time in a UCL match since September 2014, a fixture that saw keeper and club stalwart Jan Oblak make his Atl√©ti debut.

 * A win is needed for the Spaniards, who are on the verge of losing three UCL games in a row for the first time ever. However, considering they‚Äôre unbeaten in all eight previous European games versus Austrian opposition, 16 competitive fixtures at home, and ten UCL home matches (W8, D2), it‚Äôs little surprise the hosts are favourites here, although only four of those recent eight UCL home victories saw Atl√©tico lead at HT.

 * A 2-2 draw with Moscow earlier this month keeps Salzburg‚Äôs entertaining run of UEFA matches going - their last five have now witnessed both teams score and other 2.5 goals, whilst three saw both teams score in the first half! Their last three European trips to Spain have also seen both teams score and goals in both halves, with two ending in a 2-2 stalemate.

 * The visitors travel here on an 11-game unbeaten away streak in all competitions (W10, D1), netting a remarkable average of 4.0 goals per match across that period. 
 
 * Across their European away games since the beginning of 2018/19 they‚Äôve netted a healthy average of 2.2 goals per fixture too, which actually rises to 2.67 when considering only UCL group stage away games.

 * Players to watch: Atl√©tico‚Äôs Luis Su√°rez has scored five goals across his last five games for club and country, netting three after the 80th minute.

 * Dominik Szoboszlai has scored between the 40th-50th minute in Salzburg‚Äôs last three UCL fixtures.
Hot stat: Nine of Salzburg‚Äôs last ten European away games saw both teams score.

**Match Facts**


 * Returning To League Action After A 4-0 Hammering At Bayern Midweek, Atl√©tico Madrid Improved Their 2020/21 La Liga (LL) Win Rate As A Favourite To 50% With A HT/FT Double At Celta Vigo Last Round, Notching Up Three Consecutive Clean Sheets In LL Competition In The Process (W1, D2).

 * Their Last Home Game Was The 13th Of 21 LL Home Fixtures Since The Beginning Of 2019/20 To Feature Two Or Fewer Goals, Which Sets This Contest Up For Yet Another Low Scoring H2H Affair. All But One Of The Last Eight H2H LL Meetings, Including The Last Four Hosted By Atl√©tico, Have Produced Under 2.5 Goals (Average 1.25 Per Game).

 * Real Betis Are Yet To Defeat Any Club That‚Äôs Sitting Above Them In The Table At The Beginning Of The Round, With Two Of Their Three Defeats Coming By A Three-Goal Margin. The Visitors Continue To Struggle To Exceed Expectations On The Road, Now Having Failed To Win All 17 LL Trips As A Travelling Outsider (D7, L10) Since The Beginning Of The 2019/20 Season.

 * Having Failed To Score In Six Of Their Last 11 LL Away Games, And After Failing To Score In Their Last Four LL Trips To Atl√©tico, Betis Are Unlikely To Challenge The Aforementioned Pattern Of Few H2H Goals. Such Scoring Woes Have Been Particularly Prominent In The First 45 Minutes As Of Those 11 Previously Mentioned Away Games, Betis‚Äô Most Recent Win At Valencia Was The Only Occasion In Which They Recorded A First-Half Goal.

 * Players To Watch: With The First Goal Of The Game In Atl√©tico‚Äôs Last League Fixture, Luis Su√°rez Also Became The First Atl√©tico Player To Score In Two Separate LL Matches This Season.

 * Similarly, Cristian Tello Is The Only Betis Player To Score In Two LL Games And Net A Match Opener In 2020/21.

 * Hot Stat: Betis Have Taken The Most Corner Kicks In Eight Of Their Last Nine LL Matches (W3, L6).

We can barely even attack weak teams not to mention do any better in our UCL matches (excluding the Liverpool match up) but even then that was there goal keeper who slipped up giving us those chances. I‚Äôm guessing the board just believes Simeone is going to figure this out eventually with our 442 line up every damn single game. This can‚Äôt be the way we just crumble down. Costa needs to be gone already. He‚Äôs injured practically all year with some signs of flair but even then that‚Äôs RARE.

Resident-Tackle-2606,1603112407.0,je16if,5.0,1.0,"Atletico performed much better against Celta than in their previous two matches, which were disappointing draws because Atleti couldn't break through the defence and provide the strikers with enough chances. 
But even after their match against Celta, there is still a lot to be desired, both in attack and defence. It should have been 2-0 long before the 90th minute. Even the defence wasn't as impenetrable as we know Atletico for, as they have conceded quite a few chances both against Celta and Villarreal, and were only saved by Oblak in goal.

I want to be optimistic in the upcoming game against Bayern, but Atletico will likely be missing some key players - namely Gimenez in defence and Costa in attack. I really hope their defending will be a lot more solid against Bayern than in the previous 2 games, and that the midfield, with the introduction of Lucas Torreira, will be able to link up with the attack.

As for Bayern's current form: they had an embarrassing defeat against Hoffenheim due to player fatigue from the previous Europa Supercup (they apparently had only 1 day to rest), and lack of squad depth to replace those fatigued players.
But since then, they have acquired quite a number of new players, and thus have won ever since. Their form is undoubtedly good.

* Saturday 17/Oct/2020 16:00 CET

* Referee : Jos√© Luis Munuera Montero 


**Match Facts**


 * After a 3-0 home defeat to Barcelona a fortnight prior to the international break, Celta Vigo now have a mixed record of: W2, D2, L2, as a La Liga (LL) home outsider since the beginning of 2019/20. Notably, they did take points from three of their four LL home clashes versus the top four clubs of last season (W1, D2, L1), including a 1-1 draw with Atl√©tico Madrid late in the season.


 * That draw was one of seven occasions in which Celta dropped points from the 13 LL games in which they opened the scoring (W6, D5, L2) - one of the worst conversion rates of the season. A second-half LL goal difference of -4 in 2020/21 doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence in an improvement upon those numbers in this new campaign.


 * Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs unhealthy addiction to low-scoring draws continues throughout 2020/21. 'Los Rojiblancos' endured 13 draws of under 2.5 total goals last LL season, eight of them on the road, and have followed it up this time around with consecutive 0-0 results prior to the international window.


 * As a result, they finished 2019/20 with a win-rate of just 37.50% as a travelling favourite (W6, D8, L2), and will be desperate for their maiden away victory of this LL season. However, scoring in all but one of their last nine LL away fixtures could help them find their first LL win at Celta since 2017/18 (L1, D1).


 * Players to watch: Iago Aspas remains Celta‚Äôs only goal scorer this LL season, adding two team opening goals to the seven he accrued in the 2019/20 LL. Meanwhile, Atl√©ti‚Äôs Luis Su√°rez opened the scoring for Uruguay during the international break.


 * Hot stat: Both teams have scored in just two of the last 11 LL H2Hs, with ten of those producing under 1.5 first-half goals.

filipeluis3,1602241826.0,j7wzue,8.0,1.0,"There's obviously different opinions on the Arsenal/Partey situation and that we now more or less have Torreira in his place. Of course I too think it's a great loss we've suffered. At the same time, we have seen before what Cholo can bring out of his players, even though they are not always considered top talent by their previous clubs. So I think we have good reasons to believe that Torreira can develop real nice in Madrid.

Well. 

1. Considered my (and your) thoughts about this, do you really think atleti need to panic sign a replacement player for Partey? Personally I'm not too keen on Kondogbia but can't really come up with another good CDM alternative. Maybe we better save the money for now. 

2. Also, I've tried and failed to figure out; is this kind of post-transfer window signing required to be a player in the exact same position? Specifically when the release clause have been triggered(not the exact same scenario that Bar√ßa had last season with Dembel√©/Braithwhatever) 

3. If not, what position and/or other player from LaLiga/free agent do you think is a good prospect?

The main fact that we lost Thomas Partey hurts. He has been the heart and soul of our team for the past few seasons. It might be hard to read, but Thomas gave his all on the field and deserved to be captain. I could say Thomas was in contention for man of the match for every game that he played for us and he is heavily under rated. We have squad depth issues (1LB for 3 competitions) and a lot of our underperforming players are over paid and we can't move them either. Thomas has bled red and white and to see him be underpaid and leave out the back door makes you wonder what's going on with the club. We are paying the likes of Vitolo, Lemar, Herrera, Costa all huge wages. We have Correa who every year I hear the same ""this will be his best year yet"", but has yet to improve for as long as I can remember. As a supporter I can name more bad transfer decisions that El Cholo has made than good ones. Barcelona has had a more difficult time with transfer fails, but at the same time they've had a lot more coaches departing. At the end of every loss or tie Koke, Saul, and Simeone all repeat the same thing in every interview. We are so predictable and our lack of adapting our 4-3-3 is partially why. In the end It'll be interesting to see what Thomas has to say about the departure, because to me the way he left was a slap to the face and I can't blame him.",atletico,Is Cholo to blame?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/j5vdzd/is_cholo_to_blame/,2020-10-06 08:34:49

RoadsterIsHere,1601942230.0,j5ut0e,56.0,1.0,"This was a bad day. Atleticos saw their club get humiliated, and this has nothing to do with Arsenal or Partey. The Atletico board did this to themselves, and they did this to us. It should be known. Is it completely black-and-white? Of course it isn't; however, the club thought he was expendable and their bad decision making and lack of foresight bit us in the ass. 

This isn't to say Partey was a saint in the scenario, but it's important to have perspective, and it's perfectly fine to have more than one perspective. On a black-and-white note, seeing that Partey is a worker that needs to do the very best for himself and his family with the limited time a footballer has, it's perfectly respectable that he left his terrible Atleti contract to make more than quadruple what he was earning here. He got his bag, and that's to be respected. 

However, the other perspective is that of the fan, the ones who are the reason why our clubs can pay these players. Partey led us to believe he sincerely loved Atletico, and he may still love Atletico, but it has left a sour taste in the mouth. He talked about how Cholo was like a father, how Atletico was like a family, how he wanted to retire here, and stay here. Whilst it's perfectly respectable to get your massive payday, it also disappoints me (and I'm sure many) that he left us in such a lurch. Six hours before the closing of the window, the transfer wasn't by LaLiga confirmed until 30 minutes remained. This includes the fact that he never notified the club. We are in a financially difficult situation, and we just lost one of our best players for peanuts with no time to find a replacement. It was an awful way to end the relationship, without a doubt. Partey's fault lies there. 

It shouldn't come as a surprise either, star players that developed at Atletico think that they're bigger than us and are perfectly fine trampling over what we hold dear for their own sake. Griezmann, Rodrigo, Arda, Lucas and now Partey; we shouldn't be surprised. We should just be aware that what Atletico means to us won't mean the same to everyone, especially in a footballing landscape where a loyal player is even harder to find than a world class superstar. 

Like I said, It's been a dark day for Atleticos all around the world, to see what has happened on the deadline day and to see the clear demarcation of where the cartel clubs are and where we are. There is a lot of room to make-up, and it's hard to tell what it will take to get there, but the fact is that this is Atletico de Madrid. Some people may not like it, but this cycle of work, success, disappointment and failure is what's engrained in the Atletico DNA. We've suffered a lot worse, we've suffered a whole hell of a lot worse, but the fact is that our duty has loyal fans is to be there for the team and for the club. It doesn't matter about what Gil Marin, Cerezo, Berta and the board *could've* done, all that matters is what we *should* do. We shouldn't let this tank us nor should we stay hung up on this. We should continued our support and we should be even more loyal, passionate and vocal than before. We should make Torreira feel at home. This is a footnote in the history of Atletico, it's nothing more than a reminder of where we came from; it's a reality check. 

I know some people might not like it, but I just wanna show appreciation to Cholo Simeone. The talent he has, the vision he has, the passion he has, the love he has for this club is immense. There's nothing else that can drive a man of his talents to stay at the Gil Marin/Cerezo dumpster fire if it wasn't for his belief. If they did this to Simeone, you can imagine what circus it would've been if it were someone else. Simeone's role in this club is beyond that of a coach or a manager, he protects fans, he keeps Atletico's self-destruction at the hands of The Bozos away. I respect him, and regardless of your opinions, I think he should be appreciated for this, and I have 100% confidence that he'll A.) Turn Torreira into a monster and B.) Find Partey's replacement, and fill this gap and make Partey nothing more than a memory.

nsaha234,1601892796.0,j5gtbh,5.0,1.0,,atletico,H√©ctor Herrera does not consider leaving Atl√©tico de Madrid,1.0,https://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/mexicanos-mundo/2020/10/04/5f79efdd22601dab548b4580.html,2020-10-05 18:13:16
Yung-Pepe,1601887461.0,j5fwp6,12.0,1.0,"i was looking at la liga table and our direct rivals have made a solid start. Sevilla look very strong and they pushed us to the max this season and i think they will push us even harder now. Real Madrid is solid as ever, I saw some of their games. The thing is when they play bad they win and when we play good we draw. I think it‚Äôs a mentality problem, we need to grab the game by the throat and win it. Cholo can‚Äôt be blame for everything because at the end of the day it‚Äôs just luck and players. He can plan all he wants but it‚Äôs just up to the football gods. 

To my point, the rivals are getting stronger. But we have only played 3 games without a pre season so I won‚Äôt judge yet but i will judge end of the season. And if results are unsatisfactory I would hypothetically tell Cholo ‚Äúsir you can go or you can stay one more season but you have to know that the team hasn‚Äôt been the same since end of 2016‚Äù. 

We need direct changes and our competition is getting so tough now. Teams like Sociedad, Getafe even Granada are very strong so we need to be aware of this. We play amazing against big teams i.e Real or Barca because we always give our all but we struggle a lot against small teams. Atleti and its fans need to know that we are a big club now easily top 3 if not top 5 in Europe so we need to change the underdog mentality to ‚Äúbig dog‚Äù.

I think we will do amazing this season. When everyone writes atleti off we get back up and absolutely smash any negative judgement. Cholo has proved this as soon as he walked in thru door. 2011,2012,2013 all the way to 2020 we have beaten the best and shocked the world. I am pleased, we just need to keep going. I don‚Äôt care for draws so much i‚Äôm only scared of going back to the old atleti, the atleti that scared no one and now we scare the bigs boys i.e. Bayern munchen (he will beat them at least one in UCL). 
Also, our group stage in UCL is hard AF so we need to be careful that we don‚Äôt full another Qarabag. But I am happy; this season i expect top 4 finish and maybe quarter to semi final in UCL and final if not semi final in copa del rey. But as always we will see how we go game by game, partido a partido. Aupa atleti! always supporting you from the land down under! üá¶üá∫

**Match Facts**



 * Five straight La Liga (LL) games that have seen both teams score, means Valencia have witnessed a league-high 70% of their fixtures feature over 2.5 goals, although that hasn‚Äôt helped them much in the win column (W3, D3, L4). In fact, in only two seasons since the turn of the century have Valencia lost more games at this stage than this term, which will no doubt be a worry as they take on a side, Atl√©tico Madrid, that they‚Äôre winless against in 11 consecutive H2Hs (D5, L6).

 * Whilst the hosts have conceded an average of 1.6 goals per LL home game, they remain unbeaten in four of five matches played here (W2, D2, L1), despite scoring the opener in just two home games. However, it‚Äôs their come-back-ability that has shone through, as no LL team has won more points (eight) from losing positions than Valencia this season (home/away).

 * Yet even the hosts might not survive an Atl√©tico opener, considering the visitors possess the best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions after conceding an average of just 0.25 goals per LL match. That defence helped Atl√©ti to a 1-0 win over Barcelona in their last league outing, in turn extending their club record unbeaten LL run to 24 games (W15, D9) - the fourth-longest streak in the tournament‚Äôs history.

 * Clinical Atl√©tico have capitalised at all opportunities this season, netting a league-high three goals from goalkeeper errors alone. However, two consecutive two-goal margin wins on the road this LL campaign - both of which they led at HT - shows it isn‚Äôt luck that‚Äôs driving this team‚Äôs early title charge.

 * Players to watch: Manu Vallejo‚Äôs league-high three goals from the bench has been invaluable to Valencia. Meanwhile, Jo√£o F√©lix has scored either side of HT in two of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last three LL games.

**Match Facts**



 * Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs UEFA Champions League (UCL) group stage draw at Lokomotiv Moscow earlier this month was the only fixture from their previous six in all competitions in which they failed to claim all three points. However, after notching up their fourth consecutive home clean sheet this La Liga (LL) campaign, they should provide a sterner test for the Russians in Madrid.

 * In fact, the hosts have conceded in just two of their eight LL fixtures at any venue this season, but have failed to elevate that sound defending to the continental stage, having now conceded in five straight UCL fixtures.However, their last two UEFA matches at home to Russian opposition - both against Lokomotiv Moscow - produced wins ‚Äòto nil‚Äô after the three prior failed to do so.

 * Lokomotiv have now scored in 11 consecutive fixtures in all competitions (W5, D2, L4), scoring exactly one goal on nine occasions during that period. However, despite recording goals inside the first half hour in two of their three UCL 2020/21 group stage matches, and losing just one half of football, victory has eluded them in this edition (D2, L1).

 * This will be the Russian outfit‚Äôs ninth trip to Spain for a UEFA engagement, and they remain winless in their eight previous trips (D1, L7), having lost all since a 2002/03 draw at Real Madrid. Notably, they failed to score in all seven defeats.

 * Players to watch: Jo√£o F√©lix (ATM) has found the back of the net in five of his last eight appearances for club or country.

 * Anton Miranchuk‚Äôs (LOK) first-half goal in the previous H2H was one of four occasions in which he has registered Lokomotiv‚Äôs only goal across his last five club appearances in all competitions.

 * Hot stat: The second half has been the highest scoring half in six of Lokomotiv‚Äôs previous eight UEFA matches in Spain.

Atleto average more than 2 goals per match and are playing much more offensive than before, whilst defending well still.

I want to ask a simple question: who was your personal favourite player from the squad that won the 2013/14 season, and why? The polling limits the choice to 6, so feel free to post in the comments on who your favourite player was if you choose ""Other"".

My personal favourite was Diego God√≠n, who to this day is one of my favourite players of all time. Some people made find this rather surprising because forwards get nearly all the fame in football, but during the limited time when I played amateur football for my local town, I was never much good on attack and hence much better at defending - my favourite position was either CB or CDM.
As a result, I looked up to God√≠n as one of my football idols - a model of a good defender.

**Match Facts**



 * La Liga‚Äôs (LL) only remaining unbeaten team, Atl√©tico Madrid, face a tough test here as they take on a Barcelona side that, although disappointing this season, are still unbeaten in ten of the last 11 competitive H2Hs (W5, D5, L1). However the hosts have an ace up their sleeve - an exceptional defence that‚Äôs conceded a league-low two goals so far, and subsequently the best concession rate (0.29 per fixture) across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions ahead of this gameweek.

 * That‚Äôs been backed up with an attack that has netted an average of 3.0 goals per LL home game (W3, D1), helping Atl√©tico clear a -1 handicap in all three of their wins. In fact the hosts are unbeaten in 18 straight competitive home matches (W14, D4), and impressively conceded the opener on just two occasions during that period.

 * Sitting in a disappointing eighth place despite thrashing Betis 5-2 in the previous round, the last time Barcelona had precisely 11 points after seven games was back in 2002/03, a season in which they finished in sixth - their joint-worst league position since a 12th placed finish back in 1941/42. Still, they travel here unbeaten in four competitive matches (W3, D1) after netting the opener before the 25th minute in three.

 * On the road, however, they‚Äôve conceded the opener in two straight LL games, and will be desperate to rectify that here as the team that‚Äôs scored first has gone unbeaten in Bar√ßa‚Äôs last ten LL away matches, and the last six H2Hs held here.

 * Players to watch: In-form Jo√£o F√©lix has scored six goals across his last four appearances for Atl√©tico - as many as he netted in the 26 prior. Meanwhile, former Atl√©tico man Antoine Griezmann has scored after HT in Barcelona‚Äôs last two LL games.

 * Hot streak: Atl√©tico‚Äôs unbeaten 23-game LL run (W14, D9) is their best ever, and the fourth-longest run in the tournament‚Äôs history.

Strange_Quark_9,1605740593.0,jwqndi,12.0,1.0,"It has been a very difficult time over the course of the international break, with Hector Herrera getting injured and being out for a month and Su√°rez receiving a confirmation of being Coronavirus-positive.
As if that wasn't bad enough for the upcoming league match, Lucas Torreira most recently was tested positive for Coronavirus.

This many unavailable players at once shows exactly why this season, more than ever before, squad depth is crucial for the continuity of the club.

Hence for the upcoming league match, assuming a 4-4-2 formation with Koke at CM, Correa at RM and Carrasco at LM, who should start at the other CM spot from a choice of either Sa√∫l or Kondogbia?

I know many people may immediately opt for Sa√∫l due to him being a club favourite among the community, but he is still recovering and hence may not be in the best form to play against Bar√ßa from the start.
But since Sa√∫l is a long-standing club icon, he knows his teammates more and has more club experience.

The case for Kondogbia: Barcelona isn't known for being the most physical team in La Liga, so starting someone as big and strong as him would not only give us defensive solidity in midfield, but would also exploit Bar√ßa's weakness and potentially allow us to dominate the midfield in aerial situations. He would also be a significant aerial threat during corners, and greatly help out in defending crosses and corners.
The one disadvantage may be that since Kondogbia is a new player in the club, he may not have as much chemistry among the players that Sa√∫l has.

Who do you think should be the starter in midfield, and why?

Here comes my personal opinion. 

Out:

RB - Vrsaljko
Decent player, but kind of always injured. 

CM - Herrera
Great attacking initiative, but too sloppy ball handling and very risky decisions in defence. Would probably make a better place in a club that doesn't rely on defending so much. Too old to get more patience. 

ST - Saponjic
Let's face it, he will never be a starting player for Atleti. Probably better for him to leave as well. 

ST - Diego Costa
How I love this guy. What a character. Probably amazing support in the locker room as well. But yeah, you know. Old, injurie stacking up and high salary. He would still leave with honor and respect, if he does it now. 

In: 

ST - Richarlison, Everton
Tall, physical striker that seems to have a humble attitude on his future. It would be great if we could sign a striker that doesn't see us as a career stepping stone. He haven't had an exploding curve in EPL, but likely a high potential player. Would be really interesting to see what Cholo could turn him into. 

CB - Upamecano, Leipzig
If we keep using Hermoso as LB, which seems to work pretty well at least for defending purposes, we should consider a youngster with good growth potential CB. Upamecano has a crazy work rate and has really proven himself in CL. Felipe and Savic is doing a good job, but they are not getting any younger. Also, Gimenez has a tendency to get injured a bit more than the average. If we want Upamecano at a reasonable price, now is the time.

RB - Emerson, Real Betis
Next Dani Alves, right? Can't see any weak points with him, he works hard and delivers in every aspect. Trippier wasn't amazing lately, but still a solid player for us with a great attitude towards the club. Price for Emerson will also continue to increase if we can't get him now. 

On the fence:
LM - Vitolo
Didn't turn out the way we wanted, and would do better in other clubs. Too old for more patience. Could still work as a rotating player. 

LM - Lemar
Had a real struggle ever since arriving at the club, but as of late he seems much more confident! Maybe a bit more patience with him? Maybe a central position would work better for him, like in his Monaco days. Kind of-sub for F√©lix?

For the rest of the squad, I think we are more than fine.

Strange_Quark_9,1605208934.0,jt1601,15.0,1.0,"Let me start off clarifying that this discussion is only hypothetical - Messi has teased that he might want to rejoin Su√°rez in the future, but it's only that - a tease, nothing official. It's become public knowledge that Messi has been unhappy with Bar√ßa for some time now, and despite their desperate attempts to make him stay by increasing his wages, this is not sustainable for Barcelona's future due to their financial trouble, so he would have to take a pay cut if he wanted to stay.

Since then, many big rich clubs have taken interest in potentially signing Messi, namely Manchester City which would offer him lavish wages and bonuses. So if Messi wanted to rejoin Su√°rez at Atletico, he would have to choose friendship and personal preference over money and bonuses, because Atletico simply doesn't have the funds to match Man City's offer.

For the sake of this post's discussion, let's imagine Messi were to sign for Atletico on a free transfer once his Bar√ßa contract expires over the summer. Over the course of this time, the Atletico squad would be subject for potential changes. But for the sake of simplicity, let's assume Atletico would retain their most prominent players by the time Messi would arrive - Jo√£o F√©lix, Luis Su√°rez, Marcos Llorente, etc.

If Messi were to join Atletico and their squad remained mostly unchanged from present, how would he fit into Diego Simeone's tactics and formation? Or would he actually fit into the squad at all, and would it mean that he would have to directly compete for starting place with others?

The problem with fitting Messi into the squad would be the fact that Messi plays either centre forward (CF), which is fundamentally different from striker (ST) or central attacking midfielder (CAM), or right winger (RW), which is also different from right midfielder (RM). After all, Messi is classed as a forward rather than a midfielder. 

Changing to a winger or centre forward based formation would require Simeone to tactically reinvent his entire team (again!), and would thus have a risk associated with it. Hence, a better compromise would be to change to a more CAM or forward based formation like 4-1-2-1-2 narrow (like has been played before) or a more attacking one like 3-4-3 as seen in the C√°diz match.

But even then, if Messi were to fit into the squad, it would inevitably lead to competition with the likes of Su√°rez, Jo√£o F√©lix, etc. Furthermore, Messi is unfortunately an aging player like Su√°rez, so he wouldn't be able to provide as many runs as the younger players and probably wouldn't play for very long. It is thus wise to invest in the younger talent and hence give the likes of Jo√£o F√©lix more playtime.

Thus, it would definitely feel satisfying to acquire a player as prominent as Messi and it would serve as a status symbol to the world that Atletico Madrid is a big club, similar to the case of Su√°rez. It would feel satisfying to poach a key player from a rival club - a sweet vengeance for Barcelona poaching Griezmann.

But if you put the emotional factors aside and solely focus on the logical aspects - would Messi actually be beneficial for Atletico, or would he have diminishing returns?",atletico,"If Messi were to join Atletico, how would he actually fit into the club?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/jt1601/if_messi_were_to_join_atletico_how_would_he/,2020-11-13 03:22:14

_Irrelevant_dude,1604435345.0,jni5d3,12.0,1.0,"This is my thoughts on how to make atleti consistent again: (this is just a fan's opinion so its not 100% correct):

1- Full Backs. Since trippier and lodi like to stay in advanced positions to pass/cross they are sometimes vulnerable in defence. When trippier for example crosses the ball he sometimes loses the ball, and he needs to go back down to defence to defend the counter attack. But being 30 years old and not naturally very fast he naturally cant sprint fast enough to regain the ball. This was especially seen on Bayern-Atleti game where when coman would get the ball from Trippier he would run like flash and get to our box, and we would concede. Thiz doesnt strongly apply to lodi as he is younger and faster than trippier but its still a visible problem. *Hox can atleti fix this?* This takes us to the 2nd problem we are facing;

2-Formation. 442 doesnt seem to do the trick anymore, because our opponents have figured the way how to counter our tacticts (again seen in bayern-atleti and Huesca 0-0 Atleti). My opinion on the best formation is 352, because trippier and lodi can freely play as lwb/rwb or lm/rm. Im sure they would get used to play in those positions because they already are attacking minded players. Playing lwb or lm would allow them to play attackingly freely without the fear of losing the ball and the opponent to start a counter attack. The plan is that even if they lose the ball the right/left centerback would come to play lb/rb untill our team regains the ball, while the other 2 centerbacks continue marking the main striker/s from any cross from the flanks. This would also allow us to use all ouf our midfielders since our midfield is stacked with good players in comparison to our attack and defense. This formation is also great in attacking terms as we would have greater freedom and scoring goals would be easier for felix, suarez and costa because they would get more support from the midfield. Players like carrasco, saul, llorente and etc could very well join the attack at times as their positions would be secured by more defensive players like kondogbia and torreira. The formation would look something like this:
    
                        Felix                  Suarez
 
     Lodi           Saul                   Koke      Trippier      
                                   Kondogbia
                 Hermoso   Felipe   Gimenez
                                      Oblak


3- Players. This is the final problem i wanted to talk about. We need a total revolution on our squad. Our main problem imo is our wingers. While carrasco, correa and even llorente are good, they all lack pace. I know this isnt fifa, but since we are a team that attacks by counter attacks we need fast players for those counter attacks. Look at bayern for example, when bayern starts a counter attack players like gnabry sane and coman run like lighting to the opponent's goal. We need something similar. In my 352 formation i did remove the wingers for lodi and trippier but we still need wingers to substitute lodi and trippier or if simeone changes formation midgame. We normally need players like Douglas Costa, Son, etc but those are not realistic. In my opinion Szobozlai, Saint Maximinim and Iaoze Perez are our best shots. If we could develop Roro Riquelme into a world class winger that would be even better. Next we need a promising rb. Since we still have trippier, we shouldnt spend a huge chunk of our budget on a new rb, rather we should sign a promising rb for the future. At this im going to leave it to you guys to comment a promising rb we could buy, but trippier is 30 years old, he will be at his best for 2 years max, and he even wants to retire at burnley (im not sure about the team) so we need to think for a new rb. We also need a new profilic striker as suarez is a great player, but he is a short term solution only. If we could sign someone portugese, to link up perfectly with Joao Felix that would be perfect.  In short this is my plan: Spend hella lot on a already proven good winger, get a long term promising rb, cb and sign a good striker with potential to become better when suarez declines.

 * Tuesday 03/Nov/2020 18:55 CEST

 * Venue: [RZD Arena
](https://www.google.com/search?q=RZD+Arena+(Moscow)&amp;oq=RZD+Arena+(Moscow)&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)

 * Referee: Beno√Æt Bastien (France)



**Match Facts**

 * A 2-1 defeat at the weekend gave Lokomotiv Moscow a third consecutive loss by that scoreline, and strangely, the previous time they lost three games in a row (December 2019) they also met Atl√©tico Madrid in the fourth, losing 2-0 after conceding in each half. That forms part of a run of four straight losses versus the Spanish outfit that started in March 2018, all of which saw a 2+ goal margin.

 * Although they‚Äôve finished bottom in their last two UEFA Champions League (UCL) group campaigns, and lost 12 of their last 15 group stage games (W2, D1), Lokomotiv did manage to challenge Bayern Munich in their last UCL match, before conceding a 79th minute winner. However that eventual 2-1 defeat was their seventh consecutive UCL game in which they conceded exactly two goals (D1, L6) - a run that started in the last H2H held here.

 * Comfortable favourites Atl√©tico saw their 3-1 win over Osasuna at the weekend extend their unbeaten start to the La Liga (LL) campaign (W4, D2), and made them one of just two teams across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions to not yet trail in a domestic league game during 2020/21.

 * However they aren‚Äôt impenetrable, as shown by the 4-0 defeat at Bayern in their first UCL away game this season - the joint-heaviest European loss in Atl√©tico‚Äôs history. In fact that made it four losses from their last five UCL games outside Spain, albeit they‚Äôve never lost versus Russian opposition in Russia in continental competition (W5, D2).

 * Players to watch: Anton Miranchuk scored Lokomotiv‚Äôs consolation goal after the 60th minute in their last two matches.

 * Jo√£o F√©lix keeps impressing with a brace in Atl√©tico‚Äôs last two matches. He netted the opener in the previous two H2Hs.

 * Hot streak: Atl√©tico are enjoying their best-ever unbeaten LL streak (W13, D9), and the division‚Äôs joint-fourth longest run.

**Match Facts**




 * Atl√©tico Madrid still lead the way in a tight race, with the Rojiblancos‚Äô win rate of 76.92% from their first 13 league games not far behind that of the title-winning 2013/14 campaign (84.62%). Impressively, they have been beaten just once in their last 29 league outings (W19, D9, L1), winning by a two-goal margin in seven of the last 11 wins therein.

 * The hosts have also won the second half and scored exactly twice beyond the interval in four of the five straight LL home wins that precede this clash. They form the tail end of Atl√©tico‚Äôs current 41-game unbeaten LL home run against teams from outside the consistent top three of 2012/13-present (W32, D9). Their average winning margin across the last five wins in that run is 3.00 - up drastically from 1.56 across the first 27.


 * Though victorious against C√°diz in their last LL away trip, Getafe have still failed to get on the scoresheet in eight of their last ten LL away games. Eight of their last nine away league defeats have produced an odd-numbered margin, with one half being specifically won/lost 1-0 in each of the eight applicable losses.


 * Getafe‚Äôs history in LL away H2Hs vs Atl√©tico suggests further misery, with the ‚ÄòAzulones‚Äô failing to score and losing after trailing at HT (average HT margin: 1.44 goals) in each of their last nine such clashes in succession.

 * Players to watch: Sa√∫l has scored in three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five LL home finales of a calendar year, including a 2-0 win (vs Osasuna) in 2019. Hoping to be a hero himself, Getafe's Cucho Hern√°ndez accounts for his side‚Äôs last decisive awayday winner. Five of his last six career goals have come in the first half of play.

 * Hot stat: Each of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five LL home finales to a calendar year have ended in victory after a drawn first half.

Seeing atleti's growth throughout the years astounds me, with this year being a big turning point in style of play. We dont just launch the ball up, get a cheeky goal, sit back, and go for the 1-0 anymore. We play with such a beautiful quality. Tocando muy bien el balon, as the spanish would say.

Despite this, there have definitely been some amazing players in the past years. Amazing strikers like aguero, forlan (&lt;3) , el ni√±o, falcao, costa, grizzi (:/). Even Mandzu was solid. not to mention the likes of Arda Turan and Gabi; the whole backline of 2014 was so incredibly beast.

It honestly just astounds me to see the players we have right now when I physically remember sitting at the calderon as a kid and watching the likes of Fran Merida, Mariano Pernia, Sinama Pongolle, Mista, Pichu Cuellar, Paulo Assuncao, Ujfalusi, Reyes and Cleber Santana (RIP) 
and Luis Perea who my family and I once met in a Toys R Us. He was looking for a gift for his kid and he didnt know what to get so we recommended him Bionicles Legos, he ended up buying it lol.

**Match Facts**



* Now enduring a five-game winless La Liga (LL) run (D3, L2), Real Sociedad‚Äôs early title challenge looks to have run out of steam. An average of just 0.8 goals scored per fixture across that five-game run, compared to 2.1 in the opening ten rounds, is the clear reason behind that downturn, and will be a considerable worry as they take on LL leaders Atl√©tico Madrid.


 * Two consecutive 1-1 draws here has Sociedad sliding down the home form table too (W3, D3, L1), although they have scored before HT in five straight LL home fixtures showing their early attacking threat. However H2H history indicates they won‚Äôt record another stalemate as 19 consecutive competitive home H2Hs have featured a winner (W12, L7).


 * Atl√©tico grabbed their ninth win of the LL campaign at the weekend, and their sixth to see them lead at HT, as they continued their title push. An average of 2.0 goals scored per LL match has been useful, but what‚Äôs really driven them along is their defence which has conceded an average of just 0.42 goals per match - the best across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions.


 * The visitors did lose their first away game of the LL campaign in their last top-flight road trip though (W3, D1, L1), in what was the only time they‚Äôve conceded an opener on the road in LL so far, and the only time they conceded before HT. Atl√©tico don‚Äôt score many first-half goals themselves though, and have actually netted four of their six LL away goals after the 60th minute.


 * Players to watch: Sociedad‚Äôs Alexander Isak scored last time out, in what was his second match opener this LL campaign. Atl√©tico‚Äôs dangerman will likely be Luis Su√°rez who played his 200th LL game at the weekend, and netted his 23rd LL brace in the process.


 * Hot stat: There‚Äôs been five first-half penalties across Sociedad‚Äôs last five LL home games.

**Match Facts**



 * A Madrid derby defeat last weekend was more bitter than ever after Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs city-rivals Real ended Atl√©ti‚Äôs unbeaten club-record La Liga (LL) run. Still despite that 2-0 loss, Atl√©tico‚Äôs defence remains the strongest across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions after conceding an average of just 0.36 goals per game, helping the Madrid outfit to secure a clean sheet in six of their eight LL wins this season.

 * An unbeaten LL run stretching back over a year still exists at home though (W13, D4), and includes five wins (from a possible five games) against sides promoted to the top-flight within the last two seasons - four of which saw Atl√©tico win despite a -1 handicap. Expect more of the same here considering Atl√©tico have won 11 straight top-flight home H2Hs, nine despite a -1 handicap.

 * Elche journeyed to Atl√©tico for the first time nearly 61 years ago to the day, falling to a 5-1 defeat on December 20th 1959 - twenty top-flight away H2Hs since and they‚Äôre still searching for a first victory at Atl√©tico (D3, L18). To their credit they‚Äôve been hard to break down this season, losing just three LL games so far (W3, D5, L3), but a joint-league low tally of nine goals scored (0.82 per match on average) isn‚Äôt likely to give Atl√©tico nightmares in the run up to this match.

 * The visitors shouldn‚Äôt be daunted though after starting every LL road trip this season as an outsider, but still managing to achieve an 80% unbeaten rate (W2, D2, L1) - one of the division‚Äôs best as an away underdog.

 * Players to watch: Luis Su√°rez has scored four goals - all after HT - across Atl√©tico‚Äôs home wins this season. Josan‚Äôs last strike also arrived in the second half, as he netted Elche‚Äôs consolation goal in their only LL away defeat.

 * Hot stat: Atl√©tico haven‚Äôt conceded before the 85th minute in 11 straight LL home matches.

Nobody played like they wanted this win. I get it, players are exhausted but not trying to overcome on a 1-0 score? Against our rivals? Where are the colchonero cojones? Where is the Atleti that fights?

**Match Facts**



 * A 1-0 win in the last La Liga (LL) round has kept Real Madrid in touch with the top three, but six points behind city-rivals Atl√©tico Madrid - who also have a game in hand - and makes this one of the most significant Madrid derbies in recent years. Real at least bring an eight-game LL H2H unbeaten run into this clash (W3, D5), but with topsy-turvy five-game league form (W2, D1, L2), this match is anyone‚Äôs guess.

 * Yet to record consecutive LL home wins this term (W2, L2), and with just 1.5 goals scored on average per home match, it‚Äôs been an uncharacteristic season for the defending champions who have conceded the opener within 20 minutes in both losses here. In fact, their 2-1 defeat versus Alav√©s in their last LL home game gave Real a third defeat of the campaign - the same number they recorded in the entirety of last season.

 * Unstoppable Atl√©tico‚Äôs club record unbeaten LL streak was extended to 26 games in the last round (W17, D9), and boasting the best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions this season (0.2 goals conceded per match) has been a huge factor in that success, and has seen Atl√©tico equal the LL record for least goals conceded after ten rounds. However an average of 2.1 goals scored per match has also fired Atl√©tico to a win despite a -1 handicap in six of their eight LL victories, and to a HT lead in five.

 * Three straight LL away wins will have Atl√©tico primed to go for their first LL victory at Real since February 2016. However just two league goals before HT on the road so far, and two goalless first halves from four LL away games (W3, D1), means this game might start slowly.

 * Players to watch: Karim Benzema has scored before HT in his last three competitive home appearances for Real, whilst for the visitors, Jo√£o F√©lix has scored in both halves in two of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five LL wins.

 * Hot stat: Six of the last seven LL derbies were goalless at HT.

**Match Facts**



 * Salzburg (W1, D1, L3) can qualify for the UEFA Champions League (UCL) knockouts for the first time by winning here. Even if they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll still reach the UEFA Europa League should Bayern Munich avoid defeat. All seven of their UCL games this term (including qualifiers) produced over 2.5 goals and saw both teams score, while their last five UCL victories came despite conceding, so entertainment looks likely here.

 * However, with just one win from their last five UCL home games (D1, L3), the omens aren‚Äôt good. Furthermore, they‚Äôve never kept a clean sheet in UCL group stage action here (W1, D1, L3), conceding an average of 3.0 goals per match. Interestingly, they have scored in each half during all three European home games this term (W1, D1, L1).

 * Atl√©tico Madrid (W1, D3, L1) can reach the knockout stages by avoiding defeat, and encouragingly, they enter this match on the back of a ten-game unbeaten streak in all competitions (W7, D3). They opened the scoring in nine of those matches, including October‚Äôs 3-2 win over Salzburg.

 * Boasting a perfect UEFA European record in Austria (W3), each of those three fixtures featured three goals. However, the Spaniards have won just one of their last ten European away games (D2, L7 ‚Äì outcomes at 90 minutes) with only two fixtures therein goalless at HT.

 * Players to watch: M√´rgin Berisha has bagged four goals across Salzburg‚Äôs last three UCL games, and scored his side‚Äôs opener in all seven of his competitive goalscoring outings this term.

 * Two of Jo√£o Felix‚Äôs three UCL goals this term for Atl√©tico came after HT. Seven of his eight competitive club goals this season arrived after the 25th minute.

 * Hot stat: Salzburg have never drawn a European home game against Spanish opposition (W3, L4), conceding exactly one first-half goal in each of their last three such matches.

Na, fuck that, I‚Äôve been a lifelong Liverpool supporter, I haven‚Äôt an ounce of likeabilty towards your club, and when you lot knocked us out the CL last season bitter and saltiness don‚Äôt even begin to describe the shit I would talk about your club for at least the next month.

HOWEVER, based on an accumulator bet I made a couple months ago, Atleti winning the league (along with three other events simultaneously happening) would net me a far-from-significant prize purse.

I am now obviously a massive Atleti supporter this is season, while obviously still early, I was
Hoping to maybe get a couple of unbiased views on my likelihood this season from those of you that eat/sleep/breathe Atleti/La Liga.

How are Suarez and Felix getting on together? Hows the midfield coped without Partey? Oblak will obvi always be Oblak. Im going to be buying  some sort of membership to watch every league game.

Anyway, I know this was long-winded and probably cringey at points, but it was potential to be life-altering money, and this was the only place I could think to ask!

PS. If i win this bet anyone who responds to this thread gets championship memorabilia of their choosing on me.

**Match Facts**



 * Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs unbeaten La Liga (LL) march goes on with their 1-0 win at Valencia in the last round making it nine games unbeaten this term (W7, D2), and a club-record 25 undefeated stretching back into last season (W16, D9). With Atl√©tico enjoying a 79.07% win-rate at home in top-flight H2Hs, and currently sporting the best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions (0.22 goals conceded on average per match), their exceptional run is surely set to continue.

 * To further strike fear into the hearts of Real Valladolid fans, Atl√©tico are unbeaten in 21 straight competitive home matches (W15, D6), after conceding the opener on just two occasions across that period. Furthemore, they‚Äôve led at HT in three of their last four games here - including against European heavyweights Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

 * However underestimate Valladolid at your peril, as the visitors have hit good form at the right time picking up 70% of their points this term across their last three games (W2, D1), whilst a 62.5% unbeaten rate as a LL outsider this season (W2, D3, L3) shows they‚Äôve got the capacity to challenge.

 * The fact remains though that Valldolid have just one win on the road this campaign (W1, D1, L3), albeit that was an impressive 3-1 HT/FT victory over Granada in their last outing. They‚Äôve not been outclassed away in recent games though, conceding over 2.5 goals just once across their last 16 LL away matches.

 * Players to watch: Jo√£o F√©lix has scored in three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five home matches, twice netting the opener. Meanwhile, Marcos Andr√© has scored in the 15 minutes following HT in Valladolid‚Äôs last three games.

 * Hot streak: There‚Äôs been 4+ yellow cards in eight straight H2Hs. The last three witnessed 6+.

 *Leading the pack in the race for second after matchday four, Atl√©tico Madrid are unbeaten in 12 UEFA Champions League (UCL) home games (W9, D3). Six of those nine wins came against opposition from a top-five European domestic league, ending 1-0 or 2-0 (average margin: 1.67 goals).

 * Half of the Rojiblancos‚Äô ten goals scored across those six wins against such ‚Äòelite‚Äô opposition came between the 76th-90th+ minutes of play. Against all opponents, meanwhile, three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five UCL home victories have seen their deciding goal come in that same late period.

 * Bayern‚Äôs record-breaking run of successive UCL victories was extended to 15 by a 3-1 ‚Äòcruise‚Äô vs Salzburg on matchday four. In turn, they remain set to become the first team to attain perfect UCL group stage returns in successive years, having beaten the -2 handicap in six of their last nine outings in this competition.

 * Unlike the reverse meeting, this could be close, as five of Bayern‚Äôs last seven competitive away games vs Spanish teams (W2, D1, L4 - 90 mins) have yielded a single-goal margin. Bayern‚Äôs ten-year group stage away record vs pot 2 teams in a UCL group is also in negative territory: W4, D1, L5, with ‚ÄòDie Roten‚Äô conceding an average of 2.40 goals across the defeats.

 * Players to watch: Jo√£o F√©lix hit a second-half double in Atl√©tico‚Äôs last UCL home win. He has since reached 50 career goals, of which 30% have proven decisive.
 
 * Bayern‚Äôs Kingsley Coman scored first and last in the reverse meeting (W 4-0), meaning that his team has beaten the -2 handicap - and recorded a clean sheet - in 40% of his prior goalscoring UCL appearances.

 * Hot stat: The first eight meetings between pot 1 and pot 2 teams in this UCL group stage averaged 2.63 total goals per game.

&gt;  
&gt;*The 19-year-old Brazilian striker will join Atl√©tico de Madrid this summer.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*A formula that has already worked for the club on several occasions*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Atl√©tico de Madrid** already has the first reinforcement for the 2021-22 season. It is **Marcos Paulo**, a 19-year-old striker from **Fluminense** who can play both as a second striker and as a winger, and with whom the Atl√©tico has reached an agreement to defend the shield of the bear and the strawberry tree starting next season.  
&gt;  
&gt;This summer he will arrive in **Madrid** so that **Diego Pablo Simeone** can see him first hand and then make a decision about his future. If he does not stay, he could leave on loan to get minutes in **Europe**. He has a Portuguese passport and that makes him a much more desirable player for all teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;[This is how the new Atl√©tico de Madrid signing Marcos Paulo plays](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/videos/mas-videos/20210121/6667271329371971/asi-juega-marcos-paulomp4.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent years, **Atl√©tico de Madrid** has worked on attracting talent outside Spain by signing very young players at a low price and then getting a high return. In this sense, Marcos Paulo will have two mirrors to look at when he lands at the Metropolitano: **Correa** and **Gim√©nez**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eight million euros was paid by the club to **San Lorenzo** for the incorporation of **Correa** in 2014. Although his appearance in the first team was slow in coming because he had to undergo surgery for a heart problem and was a whole season in the dry dock. From 2015 onwards, he began to have minutes in the team. Until becoming one of the most used players of Cholo in recent seasons. He has already played 258 games as a colchonero.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Atletico Madrid** paid one million euros in 2013 for **Gimenez** to **Danubio**. He arrived at the age of 18 and in his first season he only played two games. But little by little he was getting minutes to the point that he was discussing the position to a colchonero legend like Miranda. The Brazilian ended up leaving, while **Josema** was taking his place in the team until he became one of the four captains. On Three Kings Day, he reached 200 official matches, almost nothing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the colchoneros are repeating the formula with Marcos Paulo. And in recent years they have used it to sign players who have turned out better or worse, such as **Nehuen**, **Nico Ib√°√±ez**, **Werner**, **Nico Schiappacasse** or **Henrique Caio**. But of course, the new colchonero striker knows who to look at.

OLEDJesus,1611907655.0,l7n4dn,6.0,1.0,"&gt;**Carrasco opens the door to the eleven for Lodi**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Atl√©tico de Madrid's Brazilian fullback has gone from being a regular to hardly getting any minutes*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Against Valencia, Diego Pablo Simeone found a solution with which Renan could get more minutes*  
&gt;  
&gt;This season, **Diego Pablo Simeone** has been making changes until he has found his favorite eleven. A perfect eleven that, due to the change of system, has no place for **Renan Lodi**. The Brazilian player has gone from being a regular in the line-ups last season to playing residual minutes this season.  
&gt;  
&gt;In spite of everything, **Cholo** is happy with his work as he acknowledged in the press conference before the match against **Valencia**: ""It is clear that the system has made him compete more with **Carrasco** than with **Hermoso**. He is a guy who at no time created any uncomfortable situation by not playing. In the eleven there are players who are better suited to one system than another. Soccer is changeable"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, just against **Valencia** it could be seen that the same player who closed the door to enter the starting eleven could now be opening it wide. It is **Yannick Carrasco**.   
&gt;  
&gt;The Belgian became the fifth player that Diego **Simeone** has tried as a replacement for **Trippier**. And the solution worked out well for Atletico Madrid, because after moving him to the right, the best minutes of the red and white team were seen in the visit of Valencia. **Yannick** is ambidextrous and had already played on the right on other occasions but always as an interior or winger.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that **Vrsaljko**, the player he had relied on until now, has not adapted to the position of fullback because it is very difficult for him to have the offensive contribution that the Englishman was having. This is normal for a player who has been out of action for almost a year and a half. Before the **Croatian**, **Ricard**, **Llorente** and **Gim√©nez** also played on that side, but none of them have convinced Cholo.  
&gt;  
&gt;This change of flank may lead in the coming weeks **Renan Lod**i to return to the prominence that we saw last season in which he was one of the most used players of **Simeone**.

I just looked up Real Madrid from last year and their player of the season was Karim Benzema, I would have thought Sergio Ramos. But it was clearly going to be one of those two. In prior years it was always going to be Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. There was always that one standout where everyone says, ""it's gonna be him.""

And that brings us to our current team. Who would be our player of the season? I don't think I've ever seen a team where I'd have such a hard time giving the award. Suarez is the obvious candidate given that he's joint top scorer but I'm probably not the only one who laughs that Suarez does nothing for 88 minutes but scores two goals with two touches in two minutes. His impact goes beyond his goals, of course--he's changed the way we play and our attitude, so for that, I think he's our POTS.

But ... Marcos Llorente has been absolutely unstoppable since Anfield, and he's provided crucial goals, assists, blocks, tackles, passes, energy, etc. If you said that you thought it should be Marcos, I wouldn't argue.

And while Koke hasn't registered a goal or assist year this season, you need look no farther than the Cornella and Eibar matches to see how important he is to the team. The team's the orchestra but Koke's the conductor. So I can see if you make a case for him.

Then there's Kieran Trippier who dictates play from right back in a way more reminiscent of Dani Alves than Juanfran. When I heard of the possible transfer I thought, ""ummm English players usually don't do well in Spain"" but Trippier has just been such a hit with us. He was terrific last season but this season he's been even better. When he was first suspended I was really worried but the team's made light of his absence in a way which actually reinforces my point, that there's no one standout.

And of course there's also Oblak between the posts. His mere presence puts opposing players off--they snatch at their shots, try to be too precise, and while Oblak does get beaten from time to time, many of his goals have been flukes (own goals) or wonder strikes (tonight's delightful finish from Racic).

Oh, and there's Yannick Carrasco who seems to have come back from China with an appreciation of how good he had it in Madrid and a determination to never leave anything on the pitch. He has been outstanding all season too.

And how about a little love for Stefan Savic, who seems to be channeling more and more of Diego Godin with each passing match. You can't play wingers as wing backs and get away with it if you don't have superb central defenders, and Savic has played more matches for us than any other centre-back.

Simply put, the only player who's not playing at the expected level is Saul (which is painful to watch). Beyond him, it's difficult to find anyone who's not contributing at the appropriate level. You have to look at our fringe players (Kondogbia, Vitolo, Torreira) and youth (Ricard, Manu Sanchez, etc.) before you start thinking, ""must contribute more."" Now that someone's found Thomas Lemar's power switch and taped it in the ""on"" position, there's no one in our typical XI who isn't playing well and contributing weekly. 

If I had to vote right now, I'd have Suarez, Trippier, Llorente, in that order. But that's what I'd have right now. Ask me in 10 minutes and it might be Suarez, Koke, Carrasco. It's just that hard to select a standout player from this team right now. They're all shining bright.",atletico,POTY conundrum,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/l4dd6m/poty_conundrum/,2021-01-25 10:03:27

I'm a big fan of your football and I'd love to see you get a fine striker to replace Suarez once he's gone.

Ideally you'd get Haaland but I can't see him not joining Real or City, all tho I might be wrong.

Jovic is clearly a great striker and he just picked the wrong club with a wrong manager. Not to mention Atletico seems to be turning former Real/Barca players into super saiyans.

 * Venue : [Wanda Metropolitano](Https://I.Imgur.Com/N2bWRQ4.Jpg)

**Match Facts**



 * With the gap at the top continuing to widen after Atl√©tico Madrid registered a sixth consecutive La Liga (LL) win last time out, the ten-time Spanish champions will now believe their first title since 2013/14 is a real possibility. In fact they sit top after 17 games for the first time since 1995/96 - a season in which Atl√©ti won the title - and have the best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions to partially thank for that (0.41 goals conceded on average per LL match).

 * That average drops even further to 0.22 when playing at home, where Atl√©tico remain unbeaten this LL season (W8, D1). A league-high six HT/FT wins at home shows their dominance here, as does an 11-game unbeaten H2H home streak across all competitions (W7, D4).

 * Valencia don‚Äôt appear in good shape to end that run, as 1982/83 was the last season in which they picked up less than their current tally of 20 points after 19 rounds. They travel here on their longest unbeaten run of the season though (W3, D2 - in all competitions), which includes scoring the opener and winning all three away games during that period.

 * Subsequently the visitors have lost just one of their last five LL road trips (W1, D3, L1), although they remain one of two teams yet to lead at HT away this LL season (HT: D6, L3). They haven‚Äôt led at HT in a competitive H2H at Atl√©tico since September 2006 either (HT: D11, L6 following).

 * Players to watch: A Luis Su√°rez brace earned Atl√©tico‚Äôs latest LL win - he‚Äôs been their first goalscorer in three of the last four LL matches he‚Äôs scored in. Similarly, Carlos Soler‚Äôs last two LL goals were match openers - including one in Valencia‚Äôs last LL road trip.

 * Hot stat: Ahead of this weekend, no team has scored in both halves more times than Atl√©tico (eight) this LL campaign.

**Match Facts**



 * Eibar‚Äôs 2-1 defeat to Levante (Jan 10) edged them ever closer to the bottom five of the La Liga (LL) table. The three defeats within their five-game league form (W1, D1, L3) have all seen both teams combine for three total goals inside one half alone, and they conceded an average of 1.00 goals per match beyond the hour mark across that trio.

 * The hosts‚Äô ‚Äòwinning start‚Äô to this year marked their sole LL home win in nine attempts (W1, D4, L4). Each of those four defeats saw them lose the first half, with the last two of them seeing ‚ÄòLos Armeros‚Äô concede exactly twice before HT, via goals conceded less than ten minutes apart.

 * After beginning Monday four points clear at the top, and with two games in hand over nearest title rivals Real Madrid, Atl√©tico Madrid are in imperious form. They have taken 12 wins from their last 13 LL outings, winning the second half in nine (75%) of those victories.

 * Across all of their league wins attained so far this season, Atl√©tico have won the second half by an average margin of 1.31 goals. They are expected to win again here, and the ‚ÄòRojiblancos‚Äô have notably won 50% of their LL away matches entered as favourites (W11, D9, L2) since the start of 2019/20.


 * Players to watch: Bryan Gil‚Äôs second-half double vs Granada (Jan 3) gave Eibar their year-opening win. Likely to upstage him, Atl√©tico‚Äôs √Ångel Correa was the opening scorer in his previous league outing (W 2-0), and each of his last three decisive LL goals have come inside the opening 20 minutes of either half. Additionally, both of his prior goals vs Eibar have come during wins by a 2+ goal margin.


 * Hot stat: Eibar have conceded beyond the hour mark in eight of their last nine LL home defeats to see both teams score.

Nuuuuuuu!!! Please reconsider this Simeone.

We are on top of the league alot, we are 4 pts ahead of Real. And still have 2 games in hands. Meaning we can be up to 10 TEN pts ahead of Real if we win are games in hands.

Maybe Simeone just don't priority the cuppa this year. He wants to concentrate on win La Liga this year and do well in CL.

I mean I would do the same thing too if I was the coach, hell if I'm on top of La Liga table, I better find a way to reserve that spot. So I'm willing to sacrifice cuppa if needed.

**Match Facts**



 * Although Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs last match saw them eliminated from the cup by a third-tier team for a second consecutive season, their fans will claim they have more important matters to attend to - such as maintaining their lead at the top of La Liga (LL). With three games in hand over their nearest rivals and the best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five leagues (0.4 goals conceded on average per match), Atl√©tico are in exceptional form this campaign.

 * They‚Äôve been unbeatable at home this LL season (W7, D1), keeping six clean sheets so far, and leading at HT in five of their seven wins. An average of 2.38 goals scored per LL home game, coupled with an average of just 0.25 conceded, has been devastating for opposition teams and sets them up nicely to extend an 11-game unbeaten top-flight H2H home run over Sevilla (W5, D6).

 * However, they may be about to meet their match in a Sevilla side that‚Äôs gone unbeaten in nine games across all competitions (W7, D2), and that‚Äôs scored in seven straight competitive H2Hs at all venues (W2, D4, L1). The sixth-placed visitors will look to cause a second-half shock to their hosts, and are certainly capable considering a mammoth eight of their nine LL victories this term actually involved a level HT scoreline.

 * A Sevilla win will put them fourth and into the UEFA Champions League places, and while the odds are against them here, they do travel to Atl√©tico on a four-game unbeaten LL away run (W3, D1). Any Sevilla surge will likely come late though, as they‚Äôve scored five of their nine LL away goals after the 75th minute.

 * Players to watch: Luis Su√°rez scored the decisive goal in three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last four wins. After scoring a hat-trick last time out, Sevilla‚Äôs dangerman could be Youssef En Nesyri.

 * Hot streak: Eighteen straight top-flight H2Hs have featured 6+ yellow cards.

**Match Facts**



 * Despite a shock midweek loss in the Copa Del Rey, league leaders Atl√©tico Madrid extended their winning La Liga (LL) run to four games at Alav√©s (W 2-1) last Sunday. They‚Äôve been beaten just once in their last 31 LL fixtures (W21, D9, L1) whilst they‚Äôre also yet to lose in 42 LL home games against teams from outside the consistent top three of 2013-2020 (W33, D9).

 * The hosts have won the second half and scored exactly twice beyond the interval in four of the six straight LL home wins that precede this clash. Expectations for Atl√©tico to also dominate after HT here are further underlined by H2H history, with a 54.0% majority (27) of their last 50 LL home H2Hs vs Athletic Bilbao seeing them win the second half.

 * Athletic are still just a short run of good form away from being genuine contenders for a UEFA Europa League spot. However, their seven-game winless run in away league action is a concern (D3, L4). Each of those four defeats saw them lose one half by a precise 1-0 scoreline, with an average of 1.00 ‚Äògoals against‚Äô beyond the hour mark per loss.

 * The visitors‚Äô five-game LL away form against the consistent top three of 2013-2020 reads: D1, L4, with their last away league win against such a side coming in January 2011 - actually against Atl√©tico. Of their nine goals conceded across the four defeats, just one came before the 40th minute.

 * Players to watch: Luis Su√°rez was the final scorer in Atl√©tico‚Äôs 2-1 win at Alav√©s, while five of his seven prior career goals vs Bilbao have come in the second half of play. Opposing forward I√±aki Williams‚Äô fond memories of a double here in Nov 2018 (L 3-2) may spur him on to score his club‚Äôs 250th all-time league goal vs Atl√©tico.

 * Hot stat: Bilbao have averaged 1.50 ‚Äògoals against‚Äô per match beyond the hour mark across their last four LL away losses vs the top three of 2013-2020.

[Second yellow card for Ricard. Its a stupid move from Ricard but as per the video he only hits the goalkeepers glove (the white thing) and not his head. Could it be a second yellow?

[Offside call on Vitolo. Odd how its offside since hes on Atleticos half](https://i.gyazo.com/0756698f18c6cf64476bce40cfd6fc5a.mp4) 

[Elbow on Torreira. Player looks at him and then goes in first with his elbow. Yellow card maybe? Not even a foul was given. Deliberate elbow.](https://i.gyazo.com/7b7f218a80715257740315d17d4553f0.mp4)

[Ricards first yellow card. The yellow is deserved for the push, but does the Cornella player not impede him?

ForgetHype,1609791145.0,kqgsd1,9.0,1.0,"Hi everyone a few days ago I posted our first monthly survey where I asked what was your GOTM, POTM and MOTM (match of the month) and we got a good amount of responses. 

Now unfortunately the website I was using did not allow me to see all the votes because it only limited to a certain amount due to me using the free version and it would cost way too much to upgrade ($32 a month) just for me to use it for this. I will be looking for other websites for the next months but if you guys have any suggestions please let me know. The reason I picked the website I used was cause it allowed me to hyperlink the goals so that you guys can check it out easily while voting. 

Was it helpful for you guys to see the goals right there? Or did it not matter much and I should just use any website even if it doesn't allow me to hyperlink in the choices. 

Also I'm not very good at graphic design or anything so if someone who is decent at presenting data please message me and we can work together to put out his info in a better form. 

Anyway here are the results for December.

The goal of the month is [Richard Sanchez's goal against Cardassar!](https://streamable.com/9ysqd2)

**Match Facts**



 * Deportivo Alav√©s have a tough start to 2021 as they welcome title-challengers Atl√©tico Madrid, a side they‚Äôre winless against in ten H2Hs (D4, L6), although to their credit just two of those games saw the teams separated by more than a margin of one goal at FT. In fact the hosts have made themselves a nuisance as an outsider this season, and at home have put together an 85.71% unbeaten rate as a LL underdog so far (W2, D4, L1).

 * Although enjoying a four-game unbeaten run at home (W1, D3), Alav√©s have scored first in just three of their eight LL home matches so far. Achieving that again will be important if they have any hope here, as with just 1.63 match goals scored on average per LL home fixture, goals have been at a premium this term.

 * Atl√©tico‚Äôs title credentials keep getting stronger, and is driven in part by a defence that‚Äôs conceded just 0.36 goals per LL fixture - the best such average across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions. With experienced coach Diego Simeone and his 60.2% win-rate in all competitions as Atl√©tico manager behind them - the best win-rate of any permanent Atl√©tico manager - the visitors look primed to continue their unbeaten H2H streak here (ten).

 * Their one and only LL defeat this term came on the road though - albeit to Real Madrid - but other than that, Atl√©tico have been strong away (W4, D1). However they‚Äôll be disappointed by their average of just 1.33 goals scored per LL road trip this term.

 * Players to watch: Lucas P√©rez has scored a penalty in three of his last six Alav√©s‚Äô appearances. The visitors‚Äô in-form player is Luis Su√°rez who has scored a first-half opener in two of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last three games.

 * Hot stat: Atl√©tico have secured a HT/FT double in a league-high 50% of their fixtures.

He‚Äôs slow when we want to counter attack and it shows. Any time there‚Äôs a through ball sent to him he either gets caught up by the defenders or he tries to get a foul to allow a free kick. We picked up Dembele and I think he should at least get to sub for Suarez to allow us to have more variety in our counter attacks. Yannick is essential on the left and it shows heavy as well Trip on the RB but we can‚Äôt be this broken with them out for injuries or ban.,atletico,Suarez is too slow when it comes to our counter attacking.

 * Saturday 20/Feb/2021 16:15 CET

 * Venue : [Wanda Metropolitano](Https://I.Imgur.Com/N2bWRQ4.Jpg)


 * Referee : Mario Melero L√≥pez



**Match Facts**



 * Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs title march continued with a 1-1 draw at Levante - and an 11th straight unbeaten La Liga (LL) game (W9, D2) - but with no clean sheet in six outings, and two draws across their last three, the league-leaders‚Äô championship charge appears to have encountered some friction. Indeed an average of 1.33 goals conceded per match across their previous six LL fixtures, is a significant increase on the 0.38 in the 16 prior.

 * Still, they remain unbeaten at home this LL campaign (W9, D2) after leading at HT in six of those nine wins, and scoring an average of 2.36 goals per match here. Another game against 
Levante might not excite neutrals after their delayed round 2 midweek clash, but it appears a good fixture for Atl√©tico considering their 11-game winning H2H run at home against the visitors.

 * Levante showed they are tough customers in that midweek draw though, a result that means they‚Äôve lost just once across their previous seven LL matches (W2, D4, L1). In fact, they‚Äôve lost only one of the last 17 LL games in which they got on the scoresheet, which shows their ability to grind out a result when their attack is on form.

 * Sitting comfortably in midtable, thanks in part to a 54.55% unbeaten rate on the road this LL campaign (W2, D4, L5), 
 * Levante will look to their last LL road trip - a 2-1 win at Real Madrid - for inspiration as they look to gain their first-ever top-flight win at Atl√©tico after a wait of nearly 60 years.

 * Players to watch: Marcos Llorente scored during the midweek H2H and has now netted Atl√©tico‚Äôs first goal in consecutive games. Similarly, Enis Bardhi also scored in that H2H and has been Levante‚Äôs first goalscorer in both matches he‚Äôs netted in this calendar year.

 * Hot stat: Five of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last six games saw both teams score before HT.

Sorry it's a bit late I was hoping to get a 100 responses (we got close 94!) but then after I got a bit busy. Next month I think I'll try to display the results a bit nicer. Also as always any feedback or suggestions would be very welcomed!



Goal of the Month:

1. [Luis Suarez 1st goal vs Cadiz](https://streamable.com/j44r7e)
2. [Saul vs Cadiz](https://streamable.com/yaqv66)
3. [Luis Suarez vs Valencia](https://streamable.com/qh9vmu)


Player of the Month:

1. Luis Suarez
2. Mario Hermoso, Thomas Lemar, Angel Correa 

Match of the Month: 

1. Away at Cadiz
2. At home for Sevilla
3. At home for Valencia


Some fun facts for you guys. Suarez had an incredible month for us not only winning GotM with almost 45% of the votes but also dominated the PotM vote as well with 81.9% of the votes going to him. Just show what a special player he is not only can he get goals after goals he can do it in style as well. 

2nd place for PotM was tied between 3 players with all 3 players receiving 3 votes each. If it wasn't for Suarez you could easily see any of these players with more votes.

The votes for MotM was pretty close between 1st and 2nd it seemed like some went for what was the more exciting match vs others going for the match where we beat a much larger team.",atletico,Atletico Monthly Survey Results,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/lj2vzr/atletico_monthly_survey_results/,2021-02-13 23:47:28

OLEDJesus,1612438920.0,lcdwoo,3.0,38.0,"&gt;**""I'm going to give myself my first chance on the bench in Spain, I've earned my credibility"".**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Simeone's former assistant at Atletico Madrid is still amazed at how the club treated him.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""I haven't seen such a farewell to an assistant coach in football,"" said the Argentinian.*  
&gt;  
&gt;The name of **Germ√°n Burgo**s has been marked by fire in the history of Atl√©tico de Madrid, not only for everything he provided as a footballer in his time in the red and white goal, but also for his almost ten years as **Simeone**'s assistant in this brilliant era of the club, which since last year has continued without the presence of the 'Mono'.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's why, every time he speaks, what he says resonates in the Colchonero world. On this occasion, the former goalkeeper gave an extensive interview to the programme '**S√∫per Deportivo Radio**' in which he referred, among many other topics, to personal issues, his idea for his first steps as head coach, his relationship with '**Cholo**' and his affectionate bond with the **Atleti** fans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Below, we review the most outstanding phrases of the talk that the Argentine coach had with the prestigious journalist **Emiliano Nunia**, host and leader of the aforementioned cycle:  
&gt;  
&gt;**FAREWELL TO ATL√âTICO**  
&gt;  
&gt;""I can say that I have never seen in football a farewell like the one **Atl√©tico Madrid** gave to an assistant coach. I have never seen in my life what they have shown me. It is unbelievable. What happens is that you give, and when you give, people receive and also return. They are like energies. You have to balance the emotions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**NEXT ADVENTURE ON THE BENCH**  
&gt;  
&gt;""What is clear to me is that I'm going to give myself my first opportunity in **Spain**. My first dream is to coach in **Spain**. It has to be here, because I have the credibility to get started. I've already had offers but I've had to turn them down.  
&gt;  
&gt;**RELATIONSHIP WITH CHOLO**  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are always in contact. We have been friends for a long time. I have more lunches and dinners with him than with my whole family, and that's true, because I spent eight years in the national team, four years at **Atl√©tico Madrid** and ten years as his assistant. We are friends and that made everything easier"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**HOW TO WIN OVER THE FOOTBALLER**  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think that winning the player's heart is achieved by transmitting honesty. From the first day you arrive at the club you have to be honest with the player about whether you are going to count on him or not. You know how you respect the player? By making him work and train. The best way to convince and win the player's heart is with work. To be a coach you have to think big. You realise that the player gives you his trust when he trains as if he were playing a game. When the competition inside makes you better prepared for the competition outside. You always look for that competitiveness. With 'Cholo' we made the player at **Atl√©tico Madrid** feel that every training session was a final. We put the necessary pressure on them so that they can handle the competition and not wait for the match. Every day our training sessions were finals"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**PLAYER PREPARATION**  
&gt;  
&gt;""Let them prepare themselves. For example, there are players who know three or four languages. That's what I would add, because the player trains two hours a day when he doesn't have a pre-season. He has 22 hours free to prepare. 22 free hours is a lot of time. So let him prepare himself in something to have a tool to help him communicate. If you have 22 hours a day free as a player, take advantage of it, learn something. That's the thing, prepare yourself for life after football.  
&gt;  
&gt;**BEING GERM√ÅN BURGOS**  
&gt;  
&gt;""What I like most about **'Mono' Burgos** is what people don't know about me. For example, yesterday I stayed up until five in the morning to watch three simultaneous football matches. I have that possibility. That's who I am, I'm a football man. I try to transmit what I feel, what I have felt as a player, what **Bielsa, Griguol, Gallego and Luis Aragones** taught me. They were the pillars on which one bases oneself to transmit to those who will be coached by me. I always say the same thing. I'm a football guy, a work guy. In my life I've tried to balance everything. Balancing in order to establish bonds, that's what's important in life and in football"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**GRIEZMANN**  
&gt;  
&gt;""He's a sensational kid. Players have moments and adaptations, and he's going to make it because he has his abilities. Then there are the interests of each one, and when you have to face him, you don't want him to do well (laughs)"".  
&gt;  
&gt;**RIVER AND THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL TEAM**  
&gt;  
&gt;""The idea of coming to **River** is in my mind, because it's simply my home. Now there is a friend like **Gallardo**, an extraordinary coach, and also **Francescoli**. Football stories are long and I'm sure that one day it will happen, because it's my dream. That's exactly what I tell young people, not to stop chasing their dreams. I am a dream chaser and **River** is one of my dreams, just like the **Argentina** national team.  
&gt;  
&gt;**LEARNING AND LESSONS LEARNED**  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'm not afraid of anything. I was always a fighter. Overcoming cancer has taught me a lot. You always have to give people hope - I would like that as a coach, one day the players will talk about me like I talk about what I have learned.

OLEDJesus,1612336154.0,lbi1qn,5.0,73.0,"&gt;**Coach, I'm still mad at you**  
&gt;  
&gt;Coach, **yesterday was seven years since you left and I'm still angry with you.** It is inevitable. I always will be. Two weeks before your departure we spoke on the phone and you didn't tell me anything, I was taken by surprise by the news. I would have liked to say goodbye and encourage you and your family in those last days. But I already told you in the letter I wrote to you in 2014: I understand you, it is normal, you would be incapable of complaining.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seven years have passed in which the world has changed a lot. We have a new home, now five changes are allowed in the games. **I don't know if you are aware of these new video refereeing technologies up there.** I would have loved to hear his opinion. I can perfectly imagine him saying ""Neither VAR, nor VUR, nor VIR, that's a penalty like a house"".  
&gt;  
&gt;In this time the great **Cholo Simeone** has taken his baton to lead **Club Atl√©tico de Madrid** to the best period of its history, fighting toe to toe with the two sharks and all the greats of Europe. To give you an idea, as I write these lines, we are ten points ahead of the Merengues and the Cul√©s...with one game less! Apart from the fact that we have the current Pichichi and Zamora in the team. **His Atleti is very Atleti.**  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm afraid it's not all good news. **I would love to tell you that if you were among us I would take you to Neptuno in a few months**, but it would not be possible. The world is facing a global pandemic because of a damn virus. In these tough times I can imagine that you would have encouraged people **""By civil or criminal means we will defeat covid""**. We could have used your motivation Coach.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to remember a story of yours that I don't think I've ever told: **the warm-up at El Plant√≠o against Real Burgos**. Precisely on February 1, 1992. The famous match in which you led the warm-up dressed in your coat and dress shoes, looking like a dandy.  
&gt;  
&gt;People took that as a joke, as an eccentricity of yours. The reality could not have been further from the truth. The team was going through a delicate moment and his figure as coach was in danger. To motivate us all about the importance of the game, he said: **""This may be my last game with you, so I'm going to warm you up as a farewell"".**  
&gt;  
&gt;What better way to commit ourselves to our coach than that? To be aware that his future was in our boots? That we had to go out and die on the field if we had to? **We tied 1-1. I scored the equalizer in the 66th minute and ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with you.** You stayed on the bench and a few months later we became kings of Spanish soccer against the eternal rivals at their own home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, Coach, seven years have passed but there are some things that do not change and I must finish this letter in the same vein as the previous one. I still remember our wars. How many times you told me after our quarrels: **""Portuguese, one day we are going to lock ourselves in a room with gloves and we are going to beat each other up""**. I always replied: ""Whenever you want"". It never happened because we are good people.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm in no hurry to visit him, **but I hope he's taking a boxing class in the meantime.** It's pending. Wait for me up there. Rest in peace, Coach.

 * Wednesday 17/Mar/2020 21:00 CEST

 * Venue: [Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)

 * Referee: Daniele Orsato ( Italy )




**Match Facts**



 * Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has won/drawn all 12 of his prior games as the Blues‚Äô boss, with his charges conceding just 2.00 shots on target per game. However, Chelsea have not recorded a shutout in any of their last six UEFA Champions League (UCL) Round-of-16 home legs against a club from one of Europe‚Äôs five biggest leagues (W1, D2, L3).



 * The first goal matters greatly, but a late twist can never be ruled out, with five (55.56%) of Chelsea‚Äôs last nine UCL games against seeing over 1.5 second-half goals. In addition, a 62.5% majority (five) of their last eight UCL clashes to produce over 0.5 goals have seen at least 50% of the match goals arrive beyond HT.




 * Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs average of 3.50 shots on target per game (90 mins only) across their last four trips to England in major competitions will likely take a significant cut here. The Rojiblancos‚Äô 1-0 defeat in the first leg saw them fail to register a single shot on target against Chelsea, and it was the first time they had failed to do so in any UCL game since March 2019.




 * The first-leg result also extended the Spanish club‚Äôs winless run in UCL action against opposition from a top-five European domestic league (D1, L4 - 90 mins). They conceded an average of 1.50 goals per game inside the 61st-75th minute period across the last two losses in that sequence.




 * Players to watch: Chelsea‚Äôs Olivier Giroud netted the winner (68‚Äô) in the first leg, meaning that four of his six prior UCL goals this term have come beyond the hour mark. In opposition, Koke was part of the Atl√©tico squad that last won inside 90 minutes on English soil back in April 2014 - four of his five all-time UCL goals have been decisive openers.




 * Hot stat: Under the current UCL format, 48 (88.89%) of Chelsea‚Äôs 54 all-time UCL home games won/lost (W45, L9 - 90 mins) have favoured the first scorer. This includes qualifiers.

I get that the last 8 matches or so have been frustrating, and it would be soulcrushing to not win the title. But what is the point in wasting energy being negative? We can't affect the outcome, there is nothing to be gained from panicking

At the end of the day if we win the title all this worrying will have just been wasted energy, and if we lose the title we can lick our wounds when the season is over and it is confirmed. Right now we have 11 games left and if we have a 4 point cushion at worst, it's a position that we would all have dreamt about at the start of the season.

**Match Facts**










 * After collecting just four points from the last 24 available, Getafe are starting to look like relegation candidates at the wrong time. However H2H history indicates there will be no bounceback here, as Getafe have failed to score a single goal against Atl√©tico Madrid for 18 consecutive meetings - a period that spans close to a decade!


 * A 3-0 win over Valencia in Getafe‚Äôs last home game will give them hope they can end that horrendous H2H record, although that victory witnessed nearly double the match goals seen on average per La Liga (LL) fixture here this season (1.62). That‚Äôs a joint-league low average, so it‚Äôs little surprise that Getafe have scored in both halves in just one of 13 LL home matches this term (W5, D3, L5).


 * League leaders Atl√©tico have an 11th top-flight title in sight, and with their league-best defence conceding an average of just 0.69 goals per game - an average only two teams can beat across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions ahead of this weekend - they look in great shape to record a seventh consecutive H2H win ‚Äòto nil‚Äô here.


 * That winning run actually started in the last season Atl√©tico won the league (2013/14), a season in which the visitors picked up an average of 2.16 points per LL road trip - albeit that pales in comparison to the hugely impressive 2.42 Atl√©tico are averaging this season! Subsequently they travel here unbeaten in seven LL away outings (W6, D1) after scoring during both halves in four.


 * Players to watch: Mauro Arambarri scored in Getafe‚Äôs last home game - all three of his LL strikes this term came at home as his side‚Äôs first goalscorer. However Atl√©tico‚Äôs Luis Su√°rez may beat him to the first goal after netting a first-half opener in the reverse fixture, and doing the same against Real Madrid earlier this month.


 * Hot stat: Six of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last ten LL games saw both teams score before HT.

Aeorith,1615423265.0,m2dnm7,22.0,1.0," I for one believe we lucked out this time, but moving forward I'm hoping (against hope):

* we continue pressing and attacking **even after we have the lead**,
* make it **at least** 2-goals advantage,
* make full use of Demb√©l√© (fatigue will eventually catch up on Su√°rez), and then
* start dropping real deep and defend around the 85th minute.

This last match just gave me lots of heart-stopping moments, I can't even count the number of times the hairs on the back of my neck and skin stood up.  


P.S. I really do hope Cholo doesn't intend Demb√©l√© to be the next ≈†aponjiƒá, because as we all know, there's only one Lord ≈†aponjiƒá.

He didn't get many minutes under Lampard, started twice since Tuchel took over. Question is though, would Cholo give him minutes right away after arrival? I guess it would be a dealbreaker for him at this point of his career if he can't slide right into the starting XI.

demodocus8,1619527995.0,mzns5f,30.0,1.0,"With all the doom and gloom we're all feeling at the moment, I thought it would be nice to maybe have a bit of a discussion about things which aren't directly related to points and trophies. 

And I guess something I have been wondering/thinking about recently is the team's make-up long term, particularly in regards to our long term striker. I am extremely happy about 10 of the players we have in the starting squad for the next few years (obviously we need some more reliable depth, RB cover, Saul to hopefully get his mojo back etc), and there seems to just be that one main long term question mark. 

I adore Suarez for what he's done this year, and all the goals he's scored, but that role is obviously something we need to think about, IMO even starting for next year where I think in an ideal world Suarez would be a super-sub/second option depending on what that particular game called for, rather than somebody we rely on to start every game.

As hugely important as his goals have been, there have been a lot of games (even earlier in the season before the pessimism set in), where it did feel a bit like we were playing with 10.5 men on the pitch, that Suarez wasn't contributing enough, and that other players would have to step up and take responsibility to cover for him (and then of course he would score two goals from two chances to win us the game). In particular I think the lack of pace has killed us on the counter where we just have no threat, meaning that when teams have pressed us high and intensely they've been able to do so without any danger, without us having any threat, and it's completely stifled us (Chelsea game was a prime example). In the Eibar and Elche games I think we all loved seeing how fluid and quick the team could be in transition, in passing and movement, though despite the scores it was also clear that the team lacked a focal point, and a 'finisher' in the box, which was to our detriment massively against Bilbao. 

I guess then the question is, who do we see in that role, to take over from Suarez for the long term? I unfortunately don't see that being Dembele (and it's fairly clear Cholo doesn't either), and I don't think he's worth the ¬£35mil which I would prefer we invest elsewhere. World class strikers are extremely rare (which is what I think we need to aim for to step up to the next level), I think it's pretty clear players like Haaland won't be coming to us, and so the main option I see being mentioned is Andre Silva, who for whatever reason I just don't see being the answer. 

Something I have wondered about before is whether or not Llorente could take that role. He's insanely quick, strong, very direct in his running with and without the ball, and great finisher with both feet in and outside the box, great football IQ and decision making in terms of making passes to set up team mates for easy goals, and is great at playing low cut-backs from the edge of the area. The idea of having him and Felix as our starting strikers, Felix drifting left and playing as a second striker, playing through balls to Llorente making runs behind from the slight right, and Llorente playing cutbacks to an oncoming Felix sounds great to me. Llorente would have the energy to press constantly and capitalise on any mistakes, the pace to destroy teams on the counter from through balls, the overall play to contribute hugely to more possession based games, and great finishing, and it could allow us to have a world class striker who fits our team perfectly and allows us to play any style the game needs. 

There's obviously a lot of questions around that though - is his positional awareness in the box good enough, is he good enough in the air, would he suit playing on the last defender or is he better from deep etc. Furthermore, he has shined so much in that RCM role - his relationship with Trippier is amazing, his energy is an asset all over the pitch, his runs from deep add a whole new dimension to our attacking play, etc, so I'm wondering what other people's thoughts are on that. Do we want Llorente as close to the opposition's goal as possible, or do we want Llorente everywhere on the pitch at all times (Give me 11 Llorentes and I will win the Champion's League). 

Also, if Llorente were to hypothetically make that move up, who would take over his spot (assuming we stick with our 3-5-2)? For me, we do need help in the midfield as well, to take over control of games and have somebody really pulling the offensive strings. Koke is great in that Busquets type role, making himself available and recycling possession well, dictating the tempo from the DM role. Lemar has been great in his close control, through balls, and quick interchanges. But somebody who can really dominate a game, ala Kroos, could still be amazing. Otherwise somebody insanely strong and agile could also help keep control, maybe even playing DM with Koke as CM. Saul really getting his mojo back and hugely stepping up would be a dream come true, but its not something we can rely on. Bruno Guimar√£es has been talked about, and he sounds great, but I haven't personally watched him play much. Here again, any thoughts are great. 

So yeah, any thoughts would be really interesting to hear, and I'm really curious how we all feel. Who do we see eventually replacing Suarez, who do we see as the 11th starting first-team playing to take this team forward long term? Are there any other positions you think need strengthening? If so where? Do we see a different formation being the long term answer, and what would that look like?",atletico,Thoughts on Atleti's Long Term Striker?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/mzns5f/thoughts_on_atletis_long_term_striker/,2021-04-27 20:53:15

Obviously there are other things to blame, like poor defending and not being consistent enough through 90 minutes of matches. But the fact is that Dembele has contributed basically nothing overall, and Suarez has suffered due to being played into the ground. Both in terms of his performances tailing off and getting injured

Say what you want about Costa's disastrous return to the club, but he was doing better this season and at the very least has a strong mentality and will never crack under pressure. I am convinced that he could have got us 8-9 goals over the season as a substitute, which could have given us the extra 3-4 points that we need.

Ashitakaa,1619290210.0,mxq9by,27.0,1.0," * Liga Santander [Matchday 32](Https://Www.Laliga.Es/En/Laliga-Santander#Box-Resultados-Competicion)
 
 * Sunday 25/Apr/2021 21:00 CET

 * Venue : [Estadio San Mam√©s](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mam√©s_Stadium_(2013))

 * Referee : Pablo Gonz√°lez Fuertes










**Match Facts**










 * Mid-table Athletic Bilbao remain hard to beat despite only two La Liga (LL) victories in 11, as this includes a whopping eight draws (L1). Winning just two of 16 H2H LL battles since the beginning of 2013 does little for their rapidly fading European aspirations (D3, L11), with this season marking their lowest points tally at this stage of any of their last seven campaigns.











 * Whilst it‚Äôs six LL home fixtures without defeat for Athletic (W2, D4), they kept only one clean sheet during that run - the same amount they‚Äôve managed over the last eight H2Hs here. Nonetheless, they‚Äôve conceded less than a goal-a-game here over the LL season, with just five games producing over 2.5 match goals.











 * Embroiled in a four-way battle for their first La Liga (LL) crown since 2013/14, back-to-back wins without conceding has put Atl√©tico Madrid back in control of their own destiny. Unsurprisingly, they top the league charts for clean sheets with an impressive 50% success rate after 32 matches, yet they‚Äôve failed to achieve that in seven of the previous nine H2H duels (W6, D2, L1).











 * For the first time this season, Atl√©tico have gone three LL away clashes without winning (D2, L1). The title contenders have, however, conceded just an average of 0.73 goals per LL away game in 2020/21, yet they‚Äôve won just one of their latest eight LL away battles when scoring one or less (D5, L2).












 * Players to watch: √Ålex Berenguer has scored three of Athletic‚Äôs last seven LL home goals, two of which were the final match goal. Whereas Atl√©tico winger Yannick Carrasco has three goals in as many games, and scored the last time his side won an away H2H back in September, 2017.











 * Hot stat: All four of Athletic‚Äôs LL meetings versus the ‚ÄòBig 3‚Äô (Atl√©tico Madrid, Barcelona &amp; Real Madrid) this season produced over 2.5 goals with both teams scoring.










 * Jose Maria Gimenez out due to yellow cards. Suarez and Joao return.

**Match Facts**








 * After a potentially seismic few days for European football, would-be ‚ÄòESL‚Äô members Atl√©tico Madrid start this La Liga (LL) round top of the table, despite taking just two wins across their previous five LL fixtures (W2, D2, L1). Ahead of kick-off, they still possess the lowest ‚Äògoals against‚Äô average in the league (0.65 per game).










 * The side from the Spanish capital has been particularly imposing in the 15 minutes either side of HT this season. In this period, they‚Äôve scored 24 goals - including four across their last three home league games (W3) - whilst conceding only once all season in response.









 * Huesca are still fighting to avoid relegation back to the Segunda Divisi√≥n, with only one defeat across their previous four LL matches (W2, D1, L1). Finding the back of the net more often has been key to their upturn in form, and their average of 1.63 goals across the previous eight LL matches is a notable increase on their season average of 1.00.











 * Despite their improving form, Huesca have only won one of their previous five LL away games (W1, D1, L3), conceding after the 80th minute in three of the previous four. They are also winless against any side starting this game week inside the league‚Äôs top seven (D3, L8).













 * Players to watch: Atl√©tico‚Äôs Marcos Llorente has scored three goals across his previous three home league appearances - two of which came in the 15 minutes on either side of HT. Huesca‚Äôs Rafa Mir has scored six goals across his previous six LL appearances, and the previous four arrived by way of two braces with a goal scored either side of the break.













 * Hot stat: Atl√©tico have won half (eight) of their home LL matches ‚Äòto nil‚Äô this season - only Sevilla have secured more such wins.









 * Felix and Suarez out

enzo_marco1,1618959063.0,mv2kvu,16.0,1.0,"&gt; In 1992 Jes√∫s Gil, helped by Enrique Cerezo, took his 95% of Atletico's shares ... without paying  
&gt;  
&gt; Justice warned of the illegality of the process once the crime had already been prescribed  
   
&gt;  
&gt; In 1992, all First and Second Clubs staged a race against the clock to adapt to the requirements of the new Sports Law,  which required all teams that they had losses to convert into a private  limited liability companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Atl√©tico was one of those teams which suffered the most to achieve this, since it took them until the last day to collect the 2,060 million pesetas necessary to meet the capital stock.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Jes√∫s Gil, its president since 1987, together with Enrique Cerezo (his vice president at the time), gathered the money at the last minute with the support of Dorna, owned by Banesto. This consisted of two loans to Atl√©tico for 1,300 and 650 million pesetas through Banco de Vitoria and Credit Lyonnais that prevented the club from relegation to Second B and with which Gil became the team's largest shareholder. A few days after the conversion was effective, the leader requested by letter the return of the money by entering the account of the entity to a personal account, and then to the banks that had lent these amounts. Then, and thanks to a private agreement, Gil acquired the shares of Cerezo (although that same November he would sell 9.46%) to keep 95% of Atl√©tico ... without paying anything!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; It took seven years for this to reach the national courts, under the nickname of 'Atl√©tico case'. In 1999, the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office filed a complaint that lead to the judicial intervention of Atl√©tico, which lasted until 2004, the year in which the National Court recorded a crime of fraud and another of misappropriation by Jes√∫s Gil , with Enrique Cerezo as a necessary cooperator and Miguel √Ångel Gil, CEO at that time, also a participant in a crime of fraud by simulating a contract.  The Supreme Court, however, declared the misappropriation prescribed (the complaint was filed two years after the statute of limitations), so neither Cerezo nor Gil Mar√≠n, with Gil already dead, had to return the 236,056 shares in their possession.

Aggressive-Attempt54,1618878558.0,muekqu,106.0,1.0,"Here's my story as an Atleti fan:

Over 10 years ago I switched from being a Real Madrid fan (my family is all  real madrid fans from Madrid) to being an Atletico Madrid fan (shocking I  know).

That summer, Florentino  Perez became president, signing every player in Europe (Ronaldo, Kaka,  etc) and already starting to agitate for more money for the top 2 in  Spain, as well as a European SuperLeague (This is an old idea).

As  someone who identifies with working people, I thought this was  disgusting and as a young person I started to question this club that I  thought I was a fan of. I figured I was only glory-hunting by watching  this team and that its values didn't actually bring me any joy.

I  started to watch Atletico Madrid from then on, and watched through  Quique Sanchez Flores, Manzano, and then Simeone becoming more and more  enamored with the idea that we fought like hell and that we were proud  of not being like Them, meaning we didn't think that winning at all  costs was the way to live.

Today  I'm disgusted because we are like Them. There is literally no difference  other than the fact that they have an order of magnitude more money and  fans. Today I renounce myself as a fan of this club since it is no  longer representing what I fell in love with.

I can understand that Atletico may be in a slightly different boat than other clubs because of how much pride has been built on the authenticity of the culture. But I find it hard to imagine jumping ship based on the actions of the guys in suits. Hell, I already dislike the owners of my favorite baseball and basketball teams, welcome to the club Atleti.

It's been made quite clear throughout Europe that these decisions all seem to have been made exclusively behind the scenes. Some situations have even showed a glaring level of intentional deceit to hide it from staff and players. It seems safe to assume this would be true of our situation as well, to some extent. I can't imagine any staff or players are on board with this.

There is an argument for dropping support for the club on a moral basis, and that is a totally commendable and understandable decision, but not everyone shares in this opinion.

Some people will want to continue supporting the club, in terms of supporting the players and manager. The squad itself won't change, and Simeone is still (as of now) the manager. They aren't involved in this decision and I don't doubt there are limitations in place to stop them talking out.

Can we not vilify these people for continuing with their support? I've seen vitriolic comments calling fellow fans ""not true fans"" and blaming them for the ESL situation. Why become divisive in our own fanbase because of an act of the ownership of the club?

AbhishekSinghal98,1618807491.0,mtt9r9,9.0,1.0,"Did you see the game yesterday between Real Madrid and Getafe? These two were incredible, the pressing, the work rate, the creativity, Getafe should have actually won the game, if it wasn't was for poor finishing. Cucurella seems like a perfect Cholo player, he was running up and down on the left flank all game long. He would fit in both of our formations either as LWB or LM or even a LB.

Arambarri pressed so well, in the middle, he was one of the main reasons why Getafe enjoyed so much possession, he put in an absolute shift.
And it's not just the workrate, they hardly put a foot wrong all game.

I'm talking about these two, because both were linked with Atletico at some point. Arambarri should have been brought instead of Torreria or Kondogbia, after Thomas left, he would have been a great replacement, he's also Uruguayan!

Vitolo should be replaced by Cucurella and Lucas with Arambarri.",atletico,Atletico should target Cucurella and Arambarri,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/mtt9r9/atletico_should_target_cucurella_and_arambarri/,2021-04-19 12:44:51

 * Sunday 18/Apr/2021 18:15 CET

 * Venue : [Wanda Metropolitano](Https://I.Imgur.Com/N2bWRQ4.Jpg)


 * Referee : C√©sar Soto Grado


**Match Facts**









 * After a recent blip, the only way Atl√©tico Madrid can ensure they remain on top is with victory here. Yet despite winning just two of their last seven competitive games (W2, D3, L2), Atl√©ti are fully expected to still have the title race in their own hands by FT, as they face a side they‚Äôre unbeaten against in six La Liga (LL) home H2Hs (W4, D2).













 * Whilst they maintain LL‚Äôs strongest home record (W11, D3, L1), three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs only four games in which they failed to win here, came across their last five home league outings (W2, D2, L1). Atl√©ti conceded first - and within 30 minutes - in three of those matches, after conceding the opener just once in their ten LL home games prior!












 * Although rock-bottom Eibar are currently enduring their worst-ever winless LL run (D4, L9), the congested bottom end of the table will give them hope coming into this final stretch. However, the ‚ÄòGunsmiths‚Äô have not been firing lately, with five HT/FT defeats from their last seven games leaving them with their lowest-ever points total at this stage of a LL campaign.











 * Three of Eibar‚Äôs four league victories came on the road though, although their last such victory was back in November (D4, L6). Interestingly, the visitors have scored first in eight of their 15 league trips so far (52.33%), but failed to win five when doing so (W3, D2, L3).











 * Players to watch: Yannick Carrasco returned from suspension with a bang last time out, slotting Atl√©ti‚Äôs fastest goal of the season in just four minutes and 36 seconds. As for Eibar, Kike Garc√≠a has contributed to 45.45% of their LL goals this season (eight goals, two assists) - four of his strikes were equalisers when 1-0 down.











 * Hot stat: Atl√©tico manager Diego Simeone has lost just one of 16 personal H2Hs vs Eibar manager Jos√© Mendilibar (W12, D3, L1), yet his last five victories came by a slim one-goal margin.










 * Joao Felix, Luis Suarez, Kieran Trippier are out.

Since arriving, we were very excited to get a top player in a position that we have been lacking any quality in for a great many years.  It seemed as though our prayers have been answered, until he picked up a series of injuries shortly after arriving.  After his most recent setback, his performances have been rather uninspiring.  Losing challenges against smaller players, poor short/long passes, dispossessions in very dangerous areas, wayward shooting (without a man on), basically everything I believe he had previously excelled in.  Im just wondering if there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that if we might just see the best version of him, because at the moment, he is not looking like a 50 million euro player, let alone what his actual worth was when we activated the clause.  Am I wearing rose colored glasses hoping he will improve, or is this the player he's been all along, and just picked up a patch of good form for you.",atletico,Has Thomas Partey ever had an extended period of poor form when he was at Atletico?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/mnhivi/has_thomas_partey_ever_had_an_extended_period_of/,2021-04-09 21:45:07

Odriozola (probably will never happen, but he is a great rb)
Lucas Hernandez (gave us 80 mil, so I'd take him back for 30mil)

You must not forget that we have money from Thomas, Kondogbia cost us a surprising 17 mil, we got 9 mil from Morata's loan and a possible extra 9 mil if they keep him for one more season or 45 mil if they buy him.

If we win La Liga (uncertain at this point) we get 150 mil, which is why I included hopeful signings.

OleoleCholoSimeone,1617889492.0,mms41s,10.0,1.0,"I know these types of posts are posted here ad-nauseum but I just wanted to give a different angle and hopefully help someone gain just a little bit of hope. 

Atleti are currently on 66 points, we would need 21 points to reach 87. 87 points has been enough to win the title in the last 2 seasons.
So in that scenario we can afford to drop 6 points from 27, if we can avoid another loss that is 3 draws and 6 wins in 9 games. Will be very hard, but not exactly impossible is it?

We have the best defence in the league which often means that a team wins the title. And we have scored as many goals as Real Madrid, so if we can tighten up a bit more and keep our defensive record as the best, the statistics are in our favour!

El Clasico next week. We have to win against Betis at every cost, but we know that at least one of our rivals will drop points. So that's something.

And maybe the biggest one: All eyes and expectations will be on Madrid &amp; Barca now, since everyone assumes that we are already out of the race. This could benefit us, the team did well in the first half of the campaign when they were flying under the radar, but have dropped off when the spotlight has been shone on them. We all know that Simeone's big strength is cultivating a strong underdog mentality and that should be a lot easier to do now compared to when we were 10 points ahead

First is lack of clinical finishing in front of goal, we squander many chances each game which has been a theme in the last 2 months. It's costing long term with the amount of points we dropped. Second is not having a press resistant DM I hope we can solve this with the signing of Bruno G, maybe even a Partey return? Third, to be play through a press exactly like Sevilla, Chelsea did. 

Overall, am I disappointed. But I saw it coming before understanding the circumstances of both teams. However, going forward with 9 games remaining and the game at Camp Nou just became a must win, it was never going to be easy let's keep believing. For me, I know we can do it we've been top spot for 22 match days I really don't want to see that change

I've just started to make videos about our beloved players on youtube and would appreciate some feedback. My main idea is to make a highlight video of Atl√©ticos ""man of the match"" every week and likely also F√©lix highlights if he gets enough playtime. 

As you might know, there are strict copyright rules, which makes it difficult to show clips longer than 7 seconds, clips in chronological order and the full screen. So I naturally have to work around that.

I would be interested to know if you have any specific video ideas, opinions on choice of music, video duration and so on. Here is a link to the latest video of Oblak's perfomance against Deportivo Alav√©s that I made.

**Match Facts**











 * Only once across the last seven decades have Sevilla had a better return after 28 top-flight rounds than they‚Äôve managed this season (W17, D4, L7), so they‚Äôll be hoping the time is right to end an eight-game winless La Liga (LL) streak (D4, L4) against a high-flying Atl√©tico Madrid side seeking their 11th title.












* Five wins ‚Äòto nil‚Äô from Sevilla‚Äôs last six LL home games, and subsequently one of the division‚Äôs best home defensive units (0.64 goals conceded per match), has the hosts in the sort of form that Atl√©tico are used to experiencing themselves. However, a first top-flight H2H home win since October 2016 may be reliant on a strong second half, as 60% of Sevilla‚Äôs LL home victories this season featured a level HT scoreline.













 * With ten rounds to go, Atl√©tico‚Äôs first title since 2013/14 is in sight thanks to losing just twice this LL campaign (W20, D6, L2), but is by no means guaranteed. The second best defence across Europe‚Äôs top five divisions (0.64 goals conceded per match) has propelled them to the top, but an attack that‚Äôs scoring 1.82 goals on average per fixture is keeping them there.












* Having already achieved more LL away wins this season (W9, D3, L1) than they‚Äôve managed at the end of their last two campaigns, this is a visiting side full of confidence and that‚Äôs conceded just three openers on the road this top-flight season (W1, D1, L1) - albeit they‚Äôve done just that in their last two trips here (D2).












 * Players to watch: Youssef En Nesyri has scored the opener in two of Sevilla‚Äôs last three LL matches - they‚Äôve won ten of the 11 league outings in which he‚Äôs netted this term. However Luis Su√°rez is arguably in better form, scoring in three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last four LL outings and twice netting the first goal.












 *Hot stat: Six of the last seven H2Hs featured 6+ yellow cards.

Mirel_Axinte,1622227750.0,nn4q0m,3.0,1.0,"I started supporting Atleti after my favourite team, Rapid Bucharest, went bankrupt and disbanded. Rapid is considered an bohemian team, used to losing titles at the last minute, the team of the working class, railway workers, poets, actors, gypsies, philosophers and pickpockets, persecuted by the authorities during the interwar period, but also during communism (not infrequently, whether in the 1930s or the 1950s, players were arrested by the authorities because they did not accept losing a match against the team of an inter-war minister or because they did not want to transfer to the team of a communist minister). It didn't win many trophies, unlike Steaua (the army team) and Dinamo (the police team) but for a long time it was the team with the most and most fanatical supporters. Rapid was in all its history the team that specialized in making its supporters suffer. Well, from that point of view, Atleti didn't let me down.

What I was going to say is that I wouldn't trade the madness of the last 25 minutes of the Osasuna match for Real/Barcelona -type triumphal marches.

I hope I don't break any rules. These are the Rapid's fans

AbhishekSinghal98,1621844870.0,njszwf,25.0,1.0,"Dembele will be returning to Lyon, so here are some of the options Atletico have,

1. Morata comes back, and plays backup to Suarez. This could probably work, I like Morata's passion, he's obviously talked a lot about his love for the club, but as a player, idk, he was the main striker in 19/20 season, he had an average season, he's a good player, but he's not been quite convincing, he's not world class, I gusss. He had a good season with Juve though, he has over 30 G+A in all competitions for them. Let's see.

2. Juve buy Morata, this would be the ideal scenario, Atletico will have some funds to bring in a new striker. Here are some of the players that could be brought in-:

2a) Lautaro Martinez, he's been linked to Atletico, it's been reported that his agent has met with Atletico, and his valuation comes around 80 million. It's very optimistic to be honest, he's a really good player, and would be an absolutely serious signing, if Atletico actually pull this off. But very difficult to afford him.

2b) Griezmann-: Cerezo last week said that he would ""love to have Griezmann back"", but feels Barca wouldn't want to sell him, although it's reported that Barca will hear offers for Griezmann. Barca have already brought in Aguero, and also talking with Depay. With Messi also expected to be staying, Griezmann could be offloaded with his ridiculous wages and an expected abundance of fowards. Very complicated, Barca are obviously going to be careful after what happened this season. Griezmann is valued around 50-60 million, if Atleti do go for him, his wages will need to fall off a cliff, and another issue with Griezmann is, there is no resale with him as he's 30 years old. He also didn't end on good terms with Simeone.

3. Morata gets loaned back to Juve, this is the worst case scenario to be honest, because then Atletico would not have Morata or neither the money to buy a decent forward. Can't expect Suarez to play 50 games throughout the season. This is unfortunately the most probable scenario, and idk who Atletico will buy if this happens, it will be interesting to see.

All I can say is that things are much better than they were in the summer of 2014, after a title winning campaign, we ended up losing a lot of players, with Thibaut's loan ending, Villa basically leaving for free, Costa and Luis leaving for Chelsea. Not only did we lose half our main eleven, we lost them for very little money. Simeone was left with a forced transition.

 This time, things are better, players who wanted to abandon ship, already did the same when things got difficult for Atletico. Whether it was Thomas, Rodri, Lucas, Griezmann etc.

The players who won the title, are players who stuck by the club when Atletico were going through tough times. I'm sure they'll stay during the good times.",atletico,Who replaces Dembele as the other number 9?

**Match Facts**










 * There‚Äôs plenty at stake at both ends in this one! For Valladolid, they need a win against their title-chasing visitors, and defeats for Huesca and Elche - or a draw for the latter - if they‚Äôre to pull off a miraculous La Liga (LL) escape. The prospects look slim though based on their current form of no win in 11 league matches (D6, L5). The final three of which ended in defeat by a margin of 2+ goals.











 * A positive for the hosts is that they do tend to find the back of the net regularly at home, scoring in five of their previous six games (W1, D3, L2). However, their issues lie in that only one side has conceded more home goals than they have (1.56 per game) this season. A high proportion of those goals (64.29%) arrived after HT.











 * The task is simple for Atl√©tico Madrid, win here and they secure their first LL crown for seven years! But anything less opens the door for neighbours Real Madrid who hold the H2H advantage in the event of tied points. They should feel confident after five wins in their previous seven LL games (D1, L1), yet their fans aren‚Äôt likely to relax with more late drama potentially on the horizon, especially as there‚Äôs been seven goals after the 75th minute across Atl√©tico‚Äôs last six matches.











 * Another nervy facet for the visitors is that they have drawn three of their seven away games vs sides currently 13th or below (W4). Furthermore, the four victories they did manage went right to the wire and were ultimately settled by a one-goal margin.











 * Players to watch: Whilst goals have been in short supply, Shon Weissman has two after the 60th minute across his last five Valladolid appearances. Atl√©tico‚Äôs Marcos Llorente scored in the last H2H, and also netted three across his previous seven appearances. Three of those four combined goals arrived after HT.











 * Hot stat: Atl√©tico are the only LL side yet to lose after scoring first this season (W21, D2).

**Match Facts**










 * Atl√©tico Madrid are close to being crowned Spanish champions for an 11th time, and a H2H record of nine victories from the last ten meetings vs Osasuna should help settle any nerves. So will possessing the second best backline across Europe‚Äôs top-five divisions after conceding an average of just 0.64 goals per LL match.











 * The stakes are high, but history suggests a potential banana skin here. Atl√©tico have been involved in a score draw in their previous three final home games of a LL campaign, and the last time they faced Osasuna in a home H2H during May they lost! However five straight home wins coming into this clash, including the last three at HT/FT, shows why they're huge favourites here.











  * In a way Osasuna are the perfect opponent for Atl√©tico as they‚Äôre already safe from relegation and out of the European race, a reality that comes across in their last five matches (W2, D1, L2). However, having no worries appears to have allowed Osasuna to lace up their shooting boots as they‚Äôve scored 2+ goals in five of their last seven LL matches - as many as in the 28 prior!











 * Sporting a three-game winless away run (D1, L2), whether Osasuna can continue that attacking prowess despite a poor average of 0.83 goals scored per road trip this top-flight campaign, and an average of only 0.69 in LL H2Hs at Atl√©tico, is yet to be seen. Especially after Osasuna struck just once before HT across their previous nine competitive away games.











 * Players to watch: After scoring last time out, √Ångel Correa has now netted four first-half goals across Atl√©tico‚Äôs last six games - they‚Äôve never lost in LL when he‚Äôs scored (W28, D4). Osasuna‚Äôs Ante Budimir also scored during midweek and has netted after the 70th minute in his last five LL goalscoring games.











 * Hot stat: There‚Äôs been four missed penalties across the last five H2Hs!

(Only considering scenarios of what we have to do to win the title)

No matter what, if we win at least 1/2 remaining games, Barca cannot beat us in la liga. 

If real win 2/2 remaining games we have to win 2/2 remaining games or win 1 tie 1 with a greater goal difference to guarantee la liga. 

If real win 1/2 remaining games we have to win 1/2 games to win la liga. 

If real win 1/2 and tie 1/2 remaining games we have to win 1/2 games to win la liga or tie both remaining games with a greater goal difference to win la liga. 

Obviously a best case scenario is both Barca and real lose their remaining games. I think personally a best case would be real do not win 1/2 remaining games, then we have to win 1/2 remaining games. 

I believe in us, we can do this!

Our final 2 games are:
Osasuna at home, who are in 11th and we haven‚Äôt lost to since 2014 (only 5 meetings since then) (we also possess the best home record in the league this season. Ranking the la liga table off of home performances only we are leading by a good number of points). 
Real valladolid away who are 17th and haven‚Äôt won a la liga game in 10 matchdays, and we haven‚Äôt lost to in 11 previous meetings (since 2010)

Barca:
celta de Vigo at home who they are a bit dodgy against and happen to be on a very good run of form 
Eibar away who they either thrash or play weird against

Real have 2 games left:
athletic bilbao away who are shitheads and they are dodgy against
finally Villareal at home who they apparently tie at home to and beat away.. lol

**Match Facts**










A perfect three-game finish guarantees Atl√©tico Madrid an 11th La Liga (LL) title, but the class of 2021‚Äôs route to immortality starts from the backline, which still possesses the lowest ‚Äògoals against‚Äô average in the league (0.63 per game). That strength is particularly evident in the 31st-60th minute period (GF 25, GA 1).











The hosts are enjoying a streak of four straight home victories, and in relation to the above, eight of their ten goals scored in that run came in the 15 minutes either side of HT. Those goals all went unanswered after being scored, ensuring that none of their last seven home victories have seen them concede later than the 21st minute.











Real Sociedad cannot end this round anywhere other than fifth, but they may well see the gap from their 6th/7th placed chasers shorten, after taking just one away point from a possible nine vs current top-four teams this term (D1, L2). Both defeats saw the decisive goal come in the ten minutes either side of HT.











Additionally, the visitors ended the last round as one of just four teams winless from 3+ LL away games entered as outsiders, and a return of five defeats ‚Äòto nil‚Äô across their last seven LL away H2Hs adds further distress. They lost by an average margin of 2.40 goals across those five, of which four saw a 1-0 HT scoreline.











Players to watch: √Ångel Correa accounts for three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last five home goals to arrive in the 15 minutes either side of the interval. Hoping to disrupt all expectations, Portu gave Sociedad the lead in their last away game vs a current top-four side - six of his seven career goals against such opposition have come beyond HT.











Hot stat: Twenty (62.5%) of Atl√©tico‚Äôs 32 post-war LL home H2Hs to see them lead ‚Äòto nil‚Äô at HT have yielded a FT clean sheet.

macklpie12,1620495954.0,n7ug7v,1.0,1.0,"This was an okay performance from the team. I predicted that we would have a good first half. It was better than I expected, actually. Even though we didn‚Äôt have much possession, our build-up plays energized our attack, with superb passes into the box. The final touch just ran away from us, and Ter Stegen‚Äôs gloves kept the game zero all. Carassco could have had better shots and passes. Suarez drew some fouls, but he wasn't really a consistent threat against his old defense. Llortente, who gets our assists, had no space to run through for the entire game. Correa had our most clear chance in the game with his powerful shot, but Lenglet annoyingly got in the way. As for our rivals, Busquets‚Äô head injury really affected them since they couldn‚Äôt get solid possession. In the first half, Barca‚Äôs attack was basically Messi vs. Atletico/Oblak. I'll talk about his impresive dribble later. The second half was exactly what I expected. We could not move the ball past Barca‚Äôs midfield. We conceded silly yet somewhat vital fouls right at the edge of the box. We started collecting yellows like Infinity Stones. Barca had open headers in front of Oblak‚Äôs net. But I think we figured out how to defend somewhat decently. Despite Barca‚Äôs good attack in the second half, I don't think Griezmann had many chances, so that‚Äôs another positive. I guess the draw was a fair result, considering we went the extra mile to keep Barca goalless.

Speaking of defending, Jan Oblak. Thank God for our goalkeeper. When I saw Messi weaving through our defense in the first half, I said, holding my head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs done.‚Äù I knew I was witnessing the goal of the season. My first thought was those Barca propaganda pages on the Internet. We all now how they kiss up to Messi. They would surely play this goal for years and years to come. But Atletico never fails to surprise me this season. I didn't know what to do when Oblak saved the shot. I was so prepared to yell at the TV, but the replay left me speechless. Most people are talking about the run, but that save was the real shocker for me. I may be biased but the amount of times Oblak has saved us from blushes this season. Someome give this guy a Ballon D'or ASAP. Don't argue with me on that, because I won't hear it: Oblak is simply a rare talent. In this new age of football, Oblak has been able to adapt but still retain his skills. The best keeper in the world, without question. Messi had like what, 3 freekicks? None of them went in! Honestly, that‚Äôs a trophy in and of itself. Oblak is my player of the season and that's my opinion. 


As for the bigger picture, well, La Liga hasn‚Äôt completely slipped away. Our next three finals will determine if we are champions. Those are all must wins. We always wanted the three points, but this draw is crucial. We have an edge over both Barca and Sevila, but I admit that the title has tilted in Real‚Äôs favor. We might need a little help from Villareal, Granada, Sevilla, and Athletic Bilbao. If Real draws one of those tough games, and we win all our finals...well, then, Atletico would be crowned La Liga champions. We can‚Äôt think too much about that right now, however. This race will go down to the wire. Whatever happens on the final day, we must be comforted by the fact that the team fought fire and wind for this title. Win or lose. 


As fans of the club that we love, we must continue to support our players, staff, or anybody a part of the team. Yes, we are entitled to our opinions and constructive criticisms of the club. However, hate and any other offensive comments or actions should not be tolerated by any loyal colchonero. I see so much of that on this reddit. We already get enough of that from everyone else. Lets be mindful of what we say to the team on the Internet. Some ""fans"" have become really bold behind the keyboard. Just a reminder: WoRDs MaTTeR. The moment our words harm our players and El Cholo Simeone, then we have already lost the competition.

 * Saturday 08/May/2021 16:15 CET

 * Venue : [Camp Nou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou)

 * Referee : Antonio Mateu Lahoz



**Match Facts**










 * This game has the makings of a title decider as Barcelona can leapfrog into first place - at least for one day - if they can end a three-game winless H2H run vs current La Liga (LL) leaders Atl√©tico Madrid. In their favour is an attack that‚Äôs scored more league goals (80) than all but one side across Europe‚Äôs top-five divisions, averaging 2.35 per game.











 * However a 2-1 defeat in their last home match ended a 13-game unbeaten LL run here (W10, D3) and showed there‚Äôs chinks in Bar√ßa‚Äôs armour. They‚Äôve now conceded two goals in consecutive LL home matches (W1, L1), putting them on the brink of conceding 2+ for three in a row for the first time since 1982/83.











 * With Atl√©tico scoring 2+ goals in two of the last three H2Hs, there‚Äôs the real chance that could happen too, although with their first LL title since 2013/14 within sight, the visitors‚Äô may foster a cagey affair. That‚Äôs worked for them in the past, and an average of just 0.65 goals conceded per top-flight match this season is identical to their last title-winning campaign at this stage, so their division-best defence could be the key to becoming Spanish champions for an 11th time.











 * That title-winning season also saw Atl√©tico register a 1-1 draw at Barcelona in May, a result the visitors may take again considering they‚Äôve won just one one of their previous six competitive road trips (W1, D2, L3) after scoring the opener just twice.











 * Players to watch: Lionel Messi scored his 50th direct free kick for Barcelona in the last round, and may get another here as he‚Äôs scored more goals against Atl√©tico (32) than all teams bar Sevilla. The visitors‚Äô hero and sole scorer last time out was Marcos Llorente - Atl√©tico have never lost when he‚Äôs scored (W14, D2).











 * Hot stat: Barcelona‚Äôs average of 6.59 shots on target per LL game stands far above the division‚Äôs second highest average, which is held by Atl√©tico (4.82).

**Match Facts**










 * Elche‚Äôs vital 1-0 win over Levante (April 24) boosted their La Liga (LL) survival hopes having previously gone seven games without victory (D3, L4). With ten of their last 14 league halves featuring exactly one goal, alongside four of the last six halves in competitive H2Hs (D1, L2), this tough clash vs title-chasing Atl√©tico Madrid could be closer than the odds suggest.












 * Belying their lowly league standing, Elche haven‚Äôt lost in six home league outings (W3, D3), scoring exactly one first-half goal in the last three. Furthermore, they‚Äôve only lost once after netting the opener in home LL games this term (W4, D3), suggesting a good start might be their best chance of a shock result.











 * Atl√©tico‚Äôs 2-1 defeat to Athletic Bilbao saw them miss the opportunity to go five points clear at the top of the table but thrillingly for neutrals, it means the top four go into this round separated by just a few points! Interestingly, they‚Äôve given almost nothing away just before and after HT, conceding just once whilst scoring 25 times between the 30th and 60th minute in league action this term.










 











 * Stuttering four-game LL away form (D2, L2) is a concern, as is scoring just one first-half goal therein. However they‚Äôve been stronger this season during the second half, having scored 14 (60.87%) of 23 away league goals after HT. Furthermore, going unbeaten in 86.67% of LL away matches entered as favourites this term is encouraging (W9, D4, L2).










 * Players to watch: All five of Elche winger Fidel‚Äôs LL goals this term came at home, none later than the 55th minute, and the last four in score draws. Another potential first scorer, √Ångel Correa has scored three goals in as many games for Atl√©tico, each coming between the 35th minute and HT.











 * Hot stat: No team has won a higher first-half corner average on the road than Atl√©tico (2.88) this LL campaign.











* Our last away win is from 28th February, against Villareal.

Lavonbatis,1623679699.0,nznlua,18.0,27.0,"This season we had a lot of youngsters loaned out in other clubs, so I thought it could be beneficial to sum up what the future might hold for them.  
Manu Sanchez (LB, Osasuna). After impressive end of the season in Osasuna, it's no surprise that Manu is one of the hottest players of our academy. The player stated that he would love to play in our side, but he and the team understands, that at this stage of his career he needs more playing time than we could offer. Loan back to Osasuna is the preferred destination for the player. If he will continue to grow, in a year or two he will be fighting for a place in our squad in both LB and LWB positions.  
Francisco Montero (CB, Besiktas). Despite the fact that he was only a rotational player in Turkey, Simeone wants to take a look at him and will give him a chance to fight for the place in a team. Napoli wants to buy him, so there is a chance that he will move to Serie A this summer.  
Victor Mollejo (RW, LW, Getafe, Mallorca). After spending all the summer fighting for the spot in Atleti squad, Mollejo had a tough year: he couldn't get any minutes in Getafe, so he moved back to LaLiga2 and won the promotion with the Mallorca side. Even though he got limited minutes there too, it seems that he is staying at Mallorca for one more year of loan with one more chance to prove, that he is ready for La Liga.  
Nehuen Perez (CB, Granada). Defender from Argentina got some international experience with Granada side playing in Europa League, but he couldn't win a solid place in starting 11. There are rumors that he was offered to Udinese as the part of Rodrigo De Paul deal, but he will probably end up loaned of again. Real Betis and Ajax already contacted Atleti for the chance of bringing him on the loan.  
Ivan Saponjic (ST, Cadiz). Super Sapo loan to a Cadiz was a strange one. He got some chances early on, almost scored against us, but then he was benched for quite some time. Atleti had a clause in a deal with Cadiz, that he must play 45 or more minutes at least five times or they will have to pay for the loan, so after Cadiz secured position in the league, the club fulfilled the clause by making Saponjic their starter for three of the last 4 games. He scored once (penalty) and recently stated, that he felt good in their squad and would love to come back next year. We might finally unleash Sapo and sell him.  
Rodrigo Riquelme (RW, LW, Bournemouth). Really strange year for RoRo in Championship. He was widely praised by coaches, had some great performances of the bench, but he barely got any starts, and never really got the trust of the team to get constant playing time. All those things aside, Atletico loved his development and Riquelme is coming back to Atleti and will start a pre-season with the first squad.  
The youngsters loaned to LaLiga2 sides: Cedric (LW, Real Oviedo, Albacete), Juan Manuel Sanabria (CM, Zaragoza), German Valera (RW, Tenerife), Borja Garces (ST, Fuenlabrada).  
It seems that Borja Garces finally left the injuries behind him and shined in his time with Fuenlabrada. He scored 7 goals there and became main striker in the team. Out of other players, only Cedric struggled to find quality minutes - other players shortly proved, that they can play in this level. Sanabria will soon sign new deal with Atleti and he will get loaned to Zaragoza for one more year and the future of the other boys is still unclear. German should get a lot of offers, so as Borja, but with the current situation with our strikers, I wouldn't be surprised if Borja would win his spot in our roster for the next season.",atletico,The present and the future of our loaned youngsters,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/nznlua/the_present_and_the_future_of_our_loaned/,2021-06-14 22:08:19

AbhishekSinghal98,1623217444.0,nvodvc,36.0,1.0,"I'm going to go through the squad, position wise and see what our club's major priorities should be, and some potential exists and rumors.

GK-:Oblak/Grbic
No need in any changes here, it's almost certain that Oblak is staying, the rumors have stopped. Grbic might be used in Copa games, this position is not a priority.

RB/RWB-:Trippier/ Vraslijko
Trippier has been linked with a move away to clubs like United, Arsenal and even Everton. But it's important to note that all these rumors have been made by low tier journalists. English media like The Mirror has had a field day with this rumor, with headlines like ""United looking to raid on cash strapped Spanish Club"", ""Arsenal looking to swap Bellerin for Trippier"". Fuck off man, why would we swap arguably the best RB in La Liga last season for a dude who can't even take throw ins. They have also have the audacity to put his price around 15 million. Even if Trippier leaves, don't think it'll be less than his release clause around 33 mil.

CB-:Savic/Felipe
CB-:Gimenez/ Hermoso
This is applicable for a 4-4-2, but if Atletico play more often with a 3-5-2, Hermoso becomes a starter, and we only have one reserve CB. I personally feel, we should also keep Montero or N.Perez to cover for our CBs, give them a bit of game time. Don't think Atletico should spend money on this position, all our CBs are solid.

LB-: Lodi/?
LWB-: Carrasco/?
In a 4-4-2, Lodi is our only traditional LB, and in a 3-5-2 only Carrasco is able to play the LWB role. Hermoso can't be used as a LB, as he can't run down the flanks, Lodi struggles in the LWB role. The answer to both the problems is *Cucurella*. He can fit in both roles, give competition to Lodi for the LB role, and play as a LWB, and allow Carrasco to play further forward in the team. This should be our first priority as we need the added depth on left side. He is young, Spanish and almost a perfect Simeone player, only problem is, I still haven't seen any concrete reports of him being targeted by Atletico.

CDM/RCM-: Koke/Herrera
CDM is for a 3-5-2, and RCM for a 4-4-2.
Koke is a level above Herrera or Kongdobia in the centre of the pitch, so Koke has to basically start all the time, but Herrera is a good player, hence we don't really need to buy another player to be playing the same role, don't think there'll be any reinforcements for this defensive role.

LCM-: Saul/Kondogbia(4-4-2)
LAM-:Lemar/Saul(3-5-2)
Saul is still pretty important in a 4-4-2, and should be starting games whenever Atletico deploy the same formation. Lemar is the better option with a 3-5-2. There have been talks of Saul leaving and unfortunately the reports have also come from tier 1 journalists, so there is a real chance Saul ends up leaving. Personally, I hope it doesn't happen.If it does, we might bring Rodrigo De Paul, this has also been reported by tier 1 journalists. The interest is real, there are talks of Bernardo too. Saul should be valued at 80 million, considering his stellar career, talks of 40 million are ridiculous. If he wants to really leave, maybe we need to entertain offers in the 60-80 price range.

RM/RAM-: Llorente/?
LM -: Carrasco/Lemar

If Atletico play a 4-4-2, Llorente plays RM, and Carrasco plays LM. In a 3-5-2, Llorente plays the RAM role, the fact is no one can really be as influential as Llorente on the RM position or as a RAM, he's a special player and combines perfectly with Trippier, maybe we need to bring in Rodrigo Riquelme back to provide cover on the right hand side. I'm not even going to include Vitolo as an option, because it's as good as playing with 10 players.

RS-: Correra/Felix
Absolutely stacked in one position. We might see both of them play if one of Felix/Correra is pushed wide or in the midfield, but yeah no need of any more players like them, means please no Dybala.

LS-: Suarez/?
We will see another number 9 in the team, it is only of a matter of when and who. Hopefully it's a permanent solution like Andre Silva or Martinez. This is a major priority for the club.

Conclusion-: 
A striker and and a LB/LWB is what we need. They should be our first priority, De Paul or a midfielder should be a secondary priority, and might only be entertained if Saul leaves.",atletico,Atletico's Summer Transfers Preview,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/nvodvc/atleticos_summer_transfers_preview/,2021-06-09 13:44:04

My concern is that if we get RDP in, he  would come in as a starter which means that Thomas Lemar will be mostly on the bench (assuming that RDP fits right in) since Koke and Marcos Llorente are undroppable due to their excellent form last season. However, Lemar still had a good season last season (particularly on defending and pressing the opposition) so I think it‚Äôs rash to drop him on the bench for a player who we are potentially paying a lot of money based on his performances on another team. Do you guys think that Lemar was not good enough for us last season and decide to replace him with RDP ( or even Bernardo Silva since we are linked with him) or do we give Lemar one more season to prove himself that he is worthy enough for the starting lineup?",atletico,Do we want Rodrigo De Paul in?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/nvm9w7/do_we_want_rodrigo_de_paul_in/,2021-06-09 11:35:42

He really should have been sent off around the 105th minute though, after a reckless studs-up tackle when he was already on a yellow. He was subbed off shortly after, and Mexico didn't look the same without him.

Should he be leaving? it goes on and on and on forever. Here's the article: [https://mufclatest.com/saul-niguez-to-push-for-manchester-united-say-reports-but-where-is-that-stated/](https://mufclatest.com/saul-niguez-to-push-for-manchester-united-say-reports-but-where-is-that-stated/)

The thing is, he didn't have a good season last term, we all know that, there statements that say he's going throught some personal stuff and that might be the reason his out of his game. At the end of the day, he still a good player, an incridible loyal one to Atleti and I think we should not sell him this summer. We're still a team who needs an improvement in depth to our squad, Sa√∫l right now doesn't have the form to be starting every game and perform well, but he can improve and give us part of this depth next season, he may go back to himself and play his usual game alongside Koke and command our midfield in the next competitions, we all know that guy is ready to give everything and more for the team.

Plus, there are only a handful of teams that can afford him (due to covid-19 scenario), United and PSG for sure, but Juve can only do it if they sell big or propose a swap deal, with that in mind, it may be hard to offload him in the summer and actually get a good deal for it.

There are other things I could say here, personally I really like him and he is all about Atleti and the latter is something that we can't buy in the market.

AbhishekSinghal98,1626256495.0,ok13gc,7.0,1.0,"We sold Saul for around 130 million couple of years ago, and Saul is worth between 40-50 million right now, so if the deal gets completed, we get 90 million for basically a 2 year loan deal. It would be one of the best pieces of tranafer business ever.

We need a striker with Dembele gone, there is no cover for a 34 year old Suarez, and we struggled a lot in the champions league, as we can't really play on the counter with Suarez. We need the depth. Griezmann can play uptop with Felix/Correra in UCL games, it will give us a real chance in the UCL. People have said that Felix's growth will be stunted with Griezmann's return. I don't think that's true, Felix can play like a Right Forward, Griezmann as a Left Foward, and Suarez in the middle with a 3-4-2-1. We played this formation a few times last season, Griezmann has good defensive work rate, so  he provides us with versatility.

I understand, our fans hate Griezmann for how he left, and it makes sense. But if he comes back, he will 100% have to take over a 50% wagecut, because we can't afford to pay a 40 million wage. This just shows how badly he wants to play for Atletico, he can just stay at Barca and keeping robbing them like Bale did with Real, but he's not doing that, he genuinely wants to play for us again. He made a huge mistake, but he's willing to correct it. 

And as for Saul, it is going to be difficult to see him go to Barca, but he will leave to one club or another. Barca won't be strengthened by this deal because they already have the trio of Pedri-Busquets-De Jong. Hell, you might even see Saul back after couple of seasons too, haha! But I can assure you, Barca will miss Griezmann if they let him go, he's been good for them, scored some worldies, amazing work rate, and even then he's been scapegoated at times.

Lavonbatis,1625673013.0,ofln5a,14.0,1.0,"Our training camp started today and Simeone with his coaching staff started preparation for the new season with 23 players. Here is some key notes from todays training session. 

We are still missing 14 players that represented or still represents their national teams (D - Gimenez, Felipe, Lodi, Trippier, Vrsaljko, Nahuen Perez, M - Carrasco, Correa, Koke, Lemar, Llorente, Herrera, F - Suarez, Felix). Felipe and Lemar were injured during their stint in the national teams and Felipe might miss the start of the season. Joao had an operation on his ankle and he will be out for at least a month. Everyone else should be joining our team after a short rest.  
Santiago Arias is back to our team after his loan in Germany, that was cut short by serious injury. That doesn't mean that he will stay to our team though, there is a chance that he will get loaned again or sold. In the other hand, Victor Mollejo wasn't with our squad and that all but confirms the rumors that he will stay at Mallorca for one more year.  
At this point we have only six players from our first squad at our disposal (Oblak, Grbic, Savic, Hermoso, Saul, Kondogbia), but there are a lot of youngsters fighting for the spot in the team - along with our newest member Marcos Paulo, there are guys coming back from loan (Montero, Manu Sanchez, Riquelme, German Valera, Saponjic, Borja Garces), some players that we already had the opportunity to see last season joining from our B squad (San Roman, Ricard Sanchez, Mario Soriano, Sergio Camello), and some new faces from our academy (G - Christian Gomez, D - Marco Moreno, M - Javi Serrano, Alberto Moreno, F - Giuliano Simeone).   


From what I could find we have scheduled five friendly games against: Numancia (July 23), Salzburg (July 28), Wolfsburg (July 31), Cadiz (August 4) and Inter Milan (August 7).",atletico,Atletico started their preparation for the next season,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atletico/comments/ofln5a/atletico_started_their_preparation_for_the_next/,2021-07-07 23:50:13

**New column: ""Top Goalscorer Per Club""**

* Lists down each club's top goalscorer
* Each row contains two players:
   * Left side is for **odd-number ranked** team (i.e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc); right side is for **even-number ranked** team (i.e. 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc)
   * Below the player image is a number indicating total goals they've scored this season (in case of mutiple players within the club with same number of goals, priority is given to more attack-minded player)
   * In the image above, in the first row:
      * Left side is Vinicius J√∫nior (Real Madrid, 1st) with 3 goals
      * Right side is √ârik Lamela (Sevilla, 2nd) with 3 goals; and so on and so forth
      * Complete list of players is tallied below before the end of this post

*Now on to the stats.*

* &gt;!3-GAME UNBEATEN STREAK!&lt;
* &gt;!Thomas Lemar currently in very good form (hopefully with goals and/or assists to come)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Matchday 3 Biggest Winners:** &gt;!Rayo Vallecano!&lt;

&gt;!Rayo conceded 4 goals and couldn't find the back of the net in the first 2 matches; but this matchday they suddenly found their shooting boots, outscoring Granada 4 goals to nil, climbing from dead-last to a very respectable 10th place.!&lt;

**Matchday 3 Biggest Losers:** &gt;!Granada!&lt;

&gt;!Granada drew their first 2 games, scoring 1 goal and conceding only 1 goal; therefore it was a big surprise to see them concede 4 goals against a team who, prior to their meeting, conceded 4 goals and never even scored. This result sees Granada drop 5 places down from 12th place to 17th place, just above the relegation zone.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Next up (after the international break): an away game against **winless (2 draws, 1 defeat, no goals scored, 1 goal conceded)** Espanyol.

**Match Facts**


 * Defending La Liga (LL) champions Atl√©tico Madrid have picked up from where they left off last term with two victories via a one-goal margin after leading 1-0 at HT. While five league wins by a one-goal margin in a row is impressive, manager Diego Simeone will be relieved to have signed forward Matheus Cunha this week, who should add goals as Atl√©tico chase more comprehensive victories.

 * The hosts are unbeaten in six H2Hs with Villarreal (W3, D3) and their fans will expect to see that record continue here, particularly as they‚Äôve won their last seven home league matches, four of them ‚Äòto nil‚Äô. Comfortable under pressure, ‚ÄòLos Rojiblancos‚Äô are unbeaten in 94.44% (W15, D2, L1) of home LL matches entered as favourites since the start of last term.

 * While their hosts have hit the ground running after lifting silverware last season, Villarreal appear to be suffering a hangover following their Europa League success as they‚Äôve begun their campaign with two uneventful goalless draws. They‚Äôre actually winless since lifting the Europa League trophy (D2, L1) ‚Äì failing to triumph in a single pre-season friendly on top of that.

 * Further highlighting how slow their start has been, their stalemate at Espanyol was their first away league fixture in ten in which they drew a blank (W4, D3, L3). As well as overcoming that poor H2H record, the ‚ÄòYellow Submarine‚Äô will have to buck another trend if they‚Äôre to triumph here, as they failed to win as an away outsider in the league last season (D3, L3).

 * Players to watch: √Ångel Correa is Atl√©tico‚Äôs only LL scorer so far this season (three goals), he‚Äôs now netted eight times in his last ten appearances. While Gerard Moreno is Villarreal‚Äôs only scorer in all competitions this term (one goal), he‚Äôs yet to score in 13 attempts against Atl√©tico.

 * Hot stat: Simeone has never lost a managerial H2H against opposite number Unai Emery (W8, D6).

**Match Facts**


 * Champions Atl√©tico Madrid began their La Liga (LL) title defence in winning fashion, recording a 2-1 victory for the fourth LL game in a row. Having never lost a top-flight home H2H (W19, D3), the ‚ÄòRojiblancos‚Äô are obvious favourites to win here, and subsequently rack up 7+ consecutive LL home victories for the second time since the October 2020 international break.




 * Topically, a 2-1 scoreline has also appeared in three of Atl√©tico‚Äôs previous six LL home wins. All three of those 2-1 victories during that winning streak saw Atl√©tico net consecutive match goals, with each occasion seeing their strikes separated by less than 15 minutes of play.




 * Visitors Elche remain tipped for relegation and look set for a torturous game here, but after drawing 0-0 with Athletic Bilbao on Monday, they could make history here. Another shutout would mark their first zero in the ‚Äògoals against‚Äô column after two LL games for the first time since 1976/77, when they started off with successive 0-0 stalemates.




 * The Franjiverdes‚Äô near 44-year wait for a first-half goal in a top-flight away H2H further underlines the already huge odds against them making a strong start. That said, they did launch a response to a 1-0 HT deficit in last season‚Äôs corresponding fixture (L 1-3), equalling Atl√©tico for second-half shots on target (3-3).




 * Players to watch: After his recent brace vs Celta Vigo, Atl√©tico‚Äôs √Ångel Correa has six goals in his last nine league games - more than in his previous 49 LL appearances! Fellow winger Tete Morente came close to an injury-time winner for Elche last Monday - he has seen each of his last three goals arrive second in the overall order and beyond the hour mark.




 * Hot stat: Going back to March 2004, eleven (44%) of Atl√©tico‚Äôs last 25 LL home wins to end 2-1 have seen them concede Goal 3 on the day.

Next year he will have 1 year left on his contract. There is no way Fiorentina isn't all for selling him this summer.

For Vlahovic to be sold for 80M next season, he'd have to be on a God level considering he will have 1 year left.

He can also lose his form or simply play worse on purpose to get his value down.

 * Sunday 15/Aug/2021 17:30 CET

 * Venue : [Estadio de Bala√≠dos]
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bala%C3%ADdos)

 * Referee : Jos√© Luis Munuera Montero


**Match Facts :**


 * Celta Vigo appear on an upwards trajectory under Eduardo Coudet, carving out a positive La Liga (LL) record under his stewardship last season (W8, D6, L6) which resulted in their highest placing in five years (8th). The momentum created by their longest top-flight winning streak (W5) of this century at the back end of last term could be enough to see them make a first winning start to a new season in six attempts (W0, D2, L3).

 * The hosts opened the scoring in all but one of their last seven LL fixtures of 2020/21, securing four HT leads along the way. In fact, don‚Äôt be surprised if there is early action at both ends, as no LL club scored or conceded more goals inside the first 15 minutes (19) or opening half hour (39) last LL season than Celta!

 * Following a two-year contract extension, Diego Simeone‚Äôs ultimate goal will be to secure Atl√©tico Madrid their first back-to-back league titles in more than 70 years. They‚Äôre expected to hit the ground running immediately, having never lost their first away trip of a new LL season with Simeone in charge (W3, D6).

 * Both of their meetings with Celta last LL season saw the opening goal within 15 minutes, and made up two of the staggering 22 times that they recorded at least two goals. In fact, they accrued the fourth-most 2+ goal victories on the road (five), with the corresponding away H2H (W 2-0) amongst that number.

 * Players to watch: Iago Aspas was one of two players to record Celta‚Äôs first goal eight times last LL season, while Luis Su√°rez scored eight team opening goals for Atl√©tico. The Uruguayan also netted in both H2Hs with Celta, and in turn, three of his last four goal scoring league matches vs 'Os Celestes' have ended 2-2!

 * Hot stat: The pre-match favourite won 15 of Celta‚Äôs 19 LL home games last season (D3, L1).

Mikk_132,1628501232.0,p0y132,34.0,1.0,"I know we are heaviliy linked to rafa mir for 10 million, we are also in the race for Lautaro 70 million, and Vlahovic 60 million. Barcelona still has to reduce wages so Griezmann is still and option as well

Out of all these players, I think Vlahovic would be the best prospect. He has only played half a good season but he truly is a beast. He is only 21(!) He fits the classic nr. 9 profile we are looking for and is extremely clinical. He plays like Haaland but still doesn't cost that much yet.

Mir is more like a morata 2.0, which has a tendency to miss absolute sittters. Sure he would be cheap, but I do not think he would be able to work wonders at Atleti.

Lautaro is also more fit to be a second striker instead of the main forward. I feel like he'd make around 10 goals and that might not be enough for that money.

Griezmann is extremely expensive and mainly plays a free role instead of a classic n.9. He knows how we play and is worldclass, yet if he leaves Barcelona they would be able to regrister more players, so if we want to keep our concurrents down we should just let it rest for now.

Bernardo Silva wants to leave City and if we manage to offload Saul we would also possibly be able to get him. I know he is not a forward but I do think he would fit in our team very well with his massive work attitude and passion. He also is only 26 so we would be able to use him for years to come

Carrassco‚Äôs little scuffle which led to a red card was already embarrassing enough. He simply cannot do that in any kind of football setting, whether it be a competitive or friendly match. He needs the learn how to control his aggression. Hopefully he gets punished in some way for that little outburst.

And if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, Simeone decided to shove and yell at the Feyenoord manager when he simply was trying to shake his hand. Instead of acting like an adult, a role model for our club, and a professional manager, he threw a tantrum on the pitch, bitching and complaining to the referee who was trying to do his job.

This kind of behavior reflects poorly on our staff and it embarrasses me that our staff would act like this. Hopefully we see none of this in our upcoming season.

I know this is highly unlikely, but with a player like Messi on the search for a new club i think every club needs to have this discussion.

Would you like to see Messi play for our club?
Do you think it is likely that he would like to play for us?

He and his family have been in Spain forever. It is not unlikely that his family might prefer to keep living in Spain.
According to many sources, Messi's english isn't the best either.

If he stays in Spain and LaLiga, Atleti is actually most likely i think. Simeone, De Paul, Correa are fellow argentinians. Obviously he would like to play with his best friend Suarez. 

The attacking trio of Felix - Suarez - Messi would be nice to see. And honestly i just want the best teachers for my boy Felix.

Mikk_132,1628234303.0,oz1qs9,11.0,1.0,"Lets start of with the situation at Barca.

They needed to lower their wages to 200 million because of financial rules la liga enforce. This is based on the income from the past seasons. Due to covid, their revenue dropped in the last 2 years, so their wage cap dropped significantly as well. 

They were mismanaged and made lots of transfers with players who received 5-year contracts with a fortune worth of salary.

The salary is in the way now and no player wants to take another wage cut. Umtiti, (Griezmann), Coutinho and Pjanic are the biggest offenders since (with the exception of griezmann) they dont add much to the club and are just sitting out their contract on the bench. 

Barca knew their were screwed and had to sell some dead weight players to relieve their wages, yet nobody got sold yet. There were rumours that Juve wanted Pjanic, and Atleti wanted Griezmann, but that did not yet come to fruition.

Messi cannot be signed and registered because the wages are too high still, and neither can their new players (Depay, Emerson, Aguero etc.)

Now that Messi seems to be leaving, they are hoping La Liga will change the rules and bail them out. The CVC deal seemed to be able to do the trick, yet a lot of clubs refused due to the blatant money loss that would cause in the long term.

What's happing now is that Messi is on his way out to PSG/City/... the new players can't be registered, and thus they still need to relieve their wages to match the wage cap. This means they will still have to sell some players, maybe for close to nothing, to make sure they are able to use their new players this season.

A lot of clubs know this, so they are probably on the look for steals. I know we, Atleti, are at least interested in Griezmann, yet the deal would have to be majorly in favour of us with Barca still paying part of his wages for that to happen. Might also be that Atletico lost interest in Griezmann now just to make sure that barca suffers more and cannot register and use their players.
