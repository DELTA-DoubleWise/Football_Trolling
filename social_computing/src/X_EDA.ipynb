What is that one single ingredient that makes us hope for something big like our own Leagure title or Champions League? I'm a 17 year old and I don't understand football tactics or strategies or formation that much. But I want to learn about it. I want to become a die-hard Dortmund fan.

I went inside, told the shop owner I was visiting, and asked her if I could give her money for it. After 10 minutes or so of me offering more and more for it and her declining she eventually, and kindly, offered it for free. I was very grateful and said I would buy €20 of goods from her shop in exchange (I hope that was a fair trade to her).  \n",

      "Can we appreciate the Bundesliga for a second? I know we are coming off a really bad week and all of us are already looking forward to the next matchday but Jesus! The Bundesliga is one of the most competitive leagues. A lot of believe that Dortmund and Bayern are the only teams that had a shot at the title but that's not always the case. I don't think we should judge a league by how hard it is to win the title but rather the quality of play week in and week out. This week we saw both Bayern and Dortmund lose games they should have won. This is terrible for us and Bayern but props to both of the teams who showed that this isn't just a two-horse race. Bayern are a damn fine team and they play some of the best football in the world but everyone in this league can upset anyone in a given day. Germany is often overlooked by Spain and England but we have some of the most loyal fans in the world, teams, and players. I'm really excited for the future of the Bundesliga as a whole. I just wished teams like RB didn't make the BL become more like the PL (through private company buying clubs) but the heart is always there for each team. This might be a controversial opinion but the smurfs - as much as I hate them - they are working class good people. If they relegated I'll miss having the derby. I just hope the Bundesliga doesn't become so commercialized. Sorry as this is bit of a rant but I'm really excited about the prospects of the league. Let's hope Dortmund can recover in the next matchday\n",

      "First Bundesliga Experience Hello! I’ve posted this two separate times in comments as watered down versions, but wanted to bring this directly here as a post also for everyone to see. Ever since following the sport myself, I have been a Liverpool fan since day one. Always stuck around watching the EPL, Serie A, and some lower league English matches. I soon realized Bundesliga was on its way to the platform. This got me quite excited as I have never watched a full Bundesliga match till yesterday. Picking the first match for myself to watch was quite the easy choice, thought why not go for Dortmund’s fixture due to well you know why. I must say, right off the bat I was impressed! About 10,000 fans and the quality of sound coming out of the TV was surreal. I’ve seen clips and highlights of what it is like, but watching the match first hand and hearing it alongside is totally different. I look forward to when everything returns to normal and I can very well watch the full atmosphere in action. The football also was also amazing to watch, giving joy as an American to see a young starlet shine and have a boost of confidence from it too. Overall I rate my experience watching my first ever Bundesliga match as a solid 10/10. I look very much forward to the future fixtures and getting to further follow this team well into their season.
