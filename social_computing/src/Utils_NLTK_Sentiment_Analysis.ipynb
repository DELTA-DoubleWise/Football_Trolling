       " \"\\nAs you can see, today we saw a much more offensive Atleti. We had 56% possession, a figure we don’t usually see. The biggest change imo is how we attacked much faster during counters. With Carrasco, Felix and Correa, you could notice how quick we transited from defence to attack. Even more so during the second half because you know, Llorente is god damn fast. We are able to control the attacking tempo the whole game, thanks to the fact that Felix is taking well charge of it. He is our maestro, without a doubt. Every attackers looked hungry, even Vitolo and Lemar are doing well today, which is a very, very good look into the season.\\n\\nThe biggest drawbacks are, firstly the penalty missed and the midfield. Saul should do better there, but the fact is we need to make Felix our primary talent because he will be our talisman for year. He needs to take and improves them. \\nFor the midfield, I’m not really a fan of the Koke - Saul double pivots. They aren’t as physical and progressive, that’s why I think Partey is really needed here. I won’t mind if they improve in this role, but as of now they aren’t really that type of player to put here imo, especially Koke. Both of them play much better in an advanced role.\\n\\nCouldn’t get the clean sheet is unlucky, but I think this match is more than enough to show we can be a really good offensive side. We need to maintain this performance, and if we do so I’m sure that we can win titles this year.\\n\\n\\n**Scoreboard:** \\n\\nDiego Costa 1 goal (1 sexy dummy as well)\\n\\nJoao Felix 1 goal 1 assist\\n\\nAngel Correa 1 goal 2 assists\\n\\nMarcos Llorente 1 goal 1 assist\\n\\nLuis Suarez 2 goals 1 assist\\n\\n**Individual:**\\n\\nCosta: Showing a much different character on the pitch today. Making more runs and you can feel his sense gels well with other attackers, especially the dummy for Felix's goal. A drawback is he still getting dispossessed a bit often and he isn't fast enough. Still, a really impressive performance for him which makes us hopeful for more of him this season.\\n\\nFelix: Basically running the game. Easily MOTM. You can see him became much more confident and he's everywhere on the pitch today. Good interplays, vision, smart passing, and that composure in front of goal. If he maintains this performance this kid is gonna write history here. One thing to note, Felix should be our first penalty taker any time any day.\\n\\nCorrea: Decisive performance, Angel. At first I was confused since he kept giving away possession, but you know, Correa will somehow makes it count. Good cross for Costa, good technique for his goal and good run+good ball for Felix. There's nothing to complain for his performance today with 3 contributions. He was kinda lost after restart last season, but hopefully he can keep his consistency because we all know he is fantastic on his day.\\n\\nCarrasco: Didn't get onto the scoreboard but still a good performance. His footwork and control really gave us life on the left. Had some good plays with Felix, and is a big threat in counters. I’m satisfied with his performance today, but he needs to show even more because Llorente is no joke right now. \\n\\nKoke, Saul: The duo had a quiet game but acceptable. Today they were better than vs Lepizig, and we progressed the ball better. However, you can still see both of them are much better playing higher up. I hope they can improve in this role because if we’re playing 4-2-3-1 as our main formation, they will be the pivots since Simeone never drops them.\\n\\nLodi and Trippier: Good performance on both ends, but lacking the preciseness in final third. Both of them got some good chances but the deliveries are a bit off. Did well moving the ball and defending though. Won’t think too much for the first game of the season, as I believe they will do good very soon.\\n\\nSavic and Felipe: decent performance. I can’t rate this duo that high because I can’t really feel the synergy between them. For example the incident between them, they should never go for the ball at the same time. They need to find a way to complement the other instead of trying to be a good stopper on their own in every scenario. I hope they improve as it goes, but you know that Atletico vein won’t feel good when we concede, even when we’re up 4 goals, lol.\\n\\nOblak: good performance as usual. Had some good saves, the goal conceded isn’t really his fault. All I say is keep up the good performance, because Oblak is too flawless to be criticised every single game.\\n\\nPartey: you can see he really progresses the ball with so much ease. The composure and passing are gold, which makes him the perfect player for our pivot. He didn’t play long so not much to say though, hope we can see him start in the next match. \\n\\nLlorente: GOAT. You know he’s gonna score once he came on lol, and he did so within a minute. His pace is out of this world which makes him so hard to mark, and you can see his delivery and composure are on point as well for Suarez’s goal. Not to mention his finishing are good af. Such a joy to watch. \\n\\nVitolo, Lemar: I have to say, they had a good display. They seem more involved, and actually doing dangerous plays, such as Vitolo’s pass to release Llorente and Lemar’s through ball to Vitolo. I hope they can keep this up, because we all know they have the qualities in them, they just need to show it consistently.\\n\\nSuarez: well, the best is for the last. What else can I say? 3 contributions in 20 minutes, and he could’ve got two more goals if he’s luckier. The impact he had on the team is insane. Look at that movement in the box, it is what we’ve been missing. He knows how to be the focal point of the attack, and I just can’t wait to see him pairing up with Felix. \\n\\nConclusion, I can’t believe this is Atleti. I’m so impressed by literally every players, and I’m convinced that we can have a wonderful season coming for us. All it takes is, well, Cholo don’t revert to a defensive setup which sees us losing points stupidly again. Though, it’s barely the first game, we need to see more of this display in upcoming matches to see.\\n\\nAUPA ATLETI. Love y’all Hermanos\",\n",

There are a ton of parallels between Athletico's style and Uruguay's style. Suarez knows how to play a high pressing counter-attack system and has had a ton of success within that system (Also IMO in this system Suarez plays his best football). People have massively overlooked this when Athletico made this move. Also, the fact that he has Simeone and a great team surrounding him solidifies you guys finding some success this season with the Champions League or La Liga. \\n\\nOverall impressive game for Suarez and this move allows Simeone to play the football he wants to play. To go back to the Uruguay comparison, last year's Athletico team reminded me of when Suarez was banned from football for like 6 months and our attack was just absolute shit, but once we got him back and revamped our midfield with Valverde, Torreira, Vecino, Nandez, and Bentancur we were amazing.

If he gets that he will add needed goals to the starving Atletico attack but he is also getting injured more often and will be away for some months each season.

He doesn't score in CL away at all for example.\\n\\nHe also is one of the worst simple passers I have seen in attack. But if he needs to do a difficult pass he can.

Let's hope Suarez clicks for us and Felix goes up a few notches. If Morata really plays well I feel he can be recalled.

Good to bounce back and won the game, but how come we are behind at the first place?\\n\\nIf we lose today I’ll blame all the players but Simeone. A system is designed at best to create as much good chances possible, which we did, but it’s up to our players to finish these. We literally could’ve scored 10 goals ffs.

The front 4 combined so well. Savic has a solid night too. And my boy Lemar finally involved in a goal, hope he gains some confidence back and do more for us. \\n\\nAnd the biggest criticism for me is the midfield.

Trippier needs a break. He's been playing consistently, attacking as much as he can (and has been good in that area), but that's affecting his defensive game - Something that Lodi needs to improve A LOT. Maybe it's time to give our younger full backs more game time to develop their game and generate competition (Sanchez was good in his debut). \\nImo Herrera was unexpectedly bad defensively, but also unexpectedly good offensively. Some of his passes were incisive and creative, but his defensive error cost us a goal - very unlike us. Also very happy for Lemar.

Saul and Koke although provide alot of defensive support, I think we should go for a ballplaying Midfielder who can cut passes to our deadly attacks..someone who can dribble a bit and make good through passes..Since we have started having more attacks where we score because of playing traditional football rather than counter attacks..if we can get someone in the middle who could help us out in counter attacks, all 3 of llorente, Felix and Suarez would see a huge boost in their goals tally.. \\nI dont mind Hector that much since he makes some good passes, but his errors are always a bit on the dangerous side..\",\n",

Players like Lemar, Torreira and Hermoso lost their calmness when we are winning the ball and trying to hold it, this misplacing all these easy passes.\\n\\nSaul is the one we missed a lot, as you can see we lacked a CM being an available passing option and actually able to sustain possession. His defensive contribution is incomparable as well.\\n\\nSuarez has been bad today, I don’t care he scored a goal in dying times or not. He wasted a lot of chances today to score one and ruined our attack for few times as well. \\n\\nSecond half is lot better. Llorente MOTM without a doubt, he’s simply amazing. Herrera was offering options and moving the ball well unlike Torreira which made a big difference. Carrasco’s technical ability made us move down the channel way better. And Felix, fantastic passes as usual. If our players can finally finish these chances for God’s sake we will be so damn good.\\n\\nKey takeaway for me is, if Saul is still unavailable then Herrera should start. He should be our 3rd choice CM not Torreira.

Felix looks good on the ball and he created a couple of good chances.. but he needs to work on getting the ball to the oppositions net faster.. He doesn't have a lot of pace so he should work on his shooting from outside the box(he did finish a good chance for us). Hector isn't a first team player nor is he a starter..bring him in when its the 60th minute and our starting midfield isn't performing, otherwise he is just taking up the space for our creative players.. Llorente isn't suited for the RM or RW position, he should have played in place of Hector( He has a great workrate, can pass, has pace, and usually helps in maintaining possession) with Correa on the right( best position for him, with alot of pace).\\nDefensively, Lodi needs to be trained on crosses and tracking back faster..You can't leave Coman open like that(one of the fastest players in the world).

       " \"Atletico's current form: in the last 3 games, they had 2 disappointing draws and one 2-0 win against Celta. From my analysis, Atletico have been struggling a lot with creativity in midfield. Since they are now perceived as a big team in La Liga, other teams treat them with respect and thus are happy to settle for a draw. As a result, this forces Atletico to try to play more attacking because the smaller teams often try to park the bus against them.\\nBut the biggest problem with Atletico playing attacking football is that is that they are not familiar with, as they are a traditionally defensive team. As a result, they are like a fish out of the water when they try to play attacking. In consequence, their midfield struggles with linking up creative passes through the centre, and often instead over-rely on crossing or hoofing the ball upfield. Furthermore, their defence left quite a few holes due to trying to push upfield and press their opponents, that their opponents exploited, and were only saved by Oblak.\\nI can only hope that Torreira can help with creativity in midfield - so far, he's been in good form and contributed to the team.\\n\\nAtletico will also be missing some key players: Costa, Gimenez, Saúl and Vrsaljko (hope I spelled his name correctly).\\n\\nBayern's current form: they suffered an embarrassing defeat to Hoffenheim mainly due to player fatigue after the Supercup match, and the lack of squad depth to replace those fatigued players. But they have acquired new players since then to solve this problem for the future. Hence, they won all other league matches ever since. They play very good attacking, high-pressing, dominant football which proves effective at breaking down defences of smaller teams.\\n\\nBut they will also be missing some key players: Sané and Gnabry are the ones I can think of.\\n\\nOverall, Bayern will inevitably play high-pressing football. Some people fear utter destruction from them. However, their attacking style will mean that Atletico will have to play the style they most excel at: defensive, counter-attacking football. If those conceded chances in league matches were mainly due to them trying to press forward, then they should be able to handle the pressure from Bayern when they play defensively. \\nThe biggest reason why Barça got destroyed by Bayern is because they should have pushed back and defend after Bayern were dominating the midfield, but they didn't, because Barça plays dominant possession-based tiki-taka - defensive football is just not their style, just how attacking football is not Atletico's style.\\n\\nThus, I do not expect a win, but under Bayern's attacking football, Atletico thrives under defensive, counter-attacking football.\\nI therefore do not fear annihilation, but just a marginal defeat.\",\n",

The performance improved a little bit in the second half. Huesca did great with what they have and could have scored on the counter  but thanks to Felipe, who played a very good game, we didn;t. Hermoso was not bad and I liked that he pushed towards the midfield. Lodi did not have the best of games in regards to crossing and did not link well with Vitolo. Vitolo only performs when he is subbed in and there are a lot of players like that which does not mean he is a bad player but he is a bad starter. Llorente was chocked by the defense and it was not his game anyway. Trippier played well and I think Joao was MOTM in my opinion. Suarez did not receive anything really except the golden chance he should have tried to put in quickly and Diego Costa fumbled the Correa great pass which we needed.

This is incredible frustrating to see and until proper communication is being used there will always be disorganization in the team.',\n",

It’s too risky to have him starting, which basically brought nothing to our game today.\\n\\nSecond, Koke needs to start. No words needed for this I guess, without him we are such a mess.\\n\\nThird, Carrasco should start as much as possible, with Llorente as a super sub. Carrasco is so good both on the ball and organising attacks, he should start and make Llorente coming late to utilise his impact. \\n\\nNot gonna blame Suarez entirely for this loss, but that ball from Felix was the 3 points for us. He shouldn’t miss that. \\n\\nOn the bright side, at least Felix is feeling it and almost led us to a win singlehandedly. He is the one to count on for the whole season.\\n\\nDon’t want to blame too much on our team, Huesca literally threw 10 men in the box and blocking everything with head counts. We had good chances, we were really close, and we should keep playing in an offensive way. I just hope Simeone doesn’t give up and continue working on breaking down tight defences and figure out how to get these wins against smaller teams.\\n\\nNext match is a big one, Villarreal.

The ball gets back to midfield and ultimately is wasted on a pass from a much worse attacking position, because the opponent had time to solidfy. The other team gets possession.\\n\\nI get that doing this leaves the team less exposed at the back, but if you're going to do this, you might as well actually try to play with more possession and patience overall, rather than play mediocre passes from midfield and crosses that don't go anywhere.\\n\\nI'm very glad we picked up a few new players, because we have so so much room for improvement.\",\n",

Also, llorente has proven to be a great player when playing centrally as a CAM or a second striker so playing him on the wing isn't a smart move.. if we saw some nice chemistry between felix and costa last Match, we saw the same with Llorente and suarez.. and llorente also becomes God like when he is a supersub as his speed is unmatched at that time.. botu Carrasco and correa are important for us on the wings..we need to have them matchfit for every game as starters because vitolo is clearly not good enough as a starter and neither is llorente on the wing..\\nIts nice that we had this match so early on in the season so that cholo can see where the squad actually lacks and hopefully can make the necessary improvements..\",\n",
